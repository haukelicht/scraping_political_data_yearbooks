         <p>Despite President Jacques Chirac and the cabinet emphasising that they wanted to govern and not merely prepare for the next presidential election in April–May 2007, the year must be divided into two periods. In fact, in comparison with previous years, the government increased the number of laws prepared or passed in a short period of time. Three issues were particularly at stake: crime and violence, immigration (and especially illegal immigration) and the fight against unemployment. In the first domain, the government stressed that it wanted to increase the length of prison sentences and drop the age of penal majority (from 16 to 13 years). Young repeat offenders could be put in jail and the judges would have to pronouce obligatory sentences. There was disagreement between the lawyers and the Ministers of Home Affairs and Justice: the former argued that these kinds of bills would not improve the situation – prevention would better than repression; the latter denounced the laxity of the magistrates. In the end, the laws were not changed, but the topic would be an important issue in the 2007 electoral campaign.</p>
         
         <p>As far as immigration was concerned, Nicolas Sarkozy announced in February that France would favour skilled immigrants. The legislation was changed in May in order to impose tougher conditions on unksilled, low income immigration while significantly easing access for highly qualified foreigners. The bill included a three‐year work permit for professionals, scientists, executives and academics. On the other hand, the bill made it harder for unskilled immigrants to bring their family members to France. Last but not least, it scrapped a measure allowing immigrants who had lived in France more than ten years to apply for citizenship.</p>
         
         <p>The Minister of the Interior also had to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants. He wanted to deport at least 25,000 of them in 2006. However, he came up against the question of illegal immigrants with children in school. Sarkozy had said that he would expel the children and their parents after the end of the school year. However, teachers, parents, neighbours and priests joined in an ‘Education without borders’ network, which began to hide the children. Sarkozy then changed his mind and established a number of conditions that would justify legalization of illegal immigrant families; he would grant residency papers to only 6,000 people while more than 20,000 applied. The conditions of regularisation appeared to be very arbitrary.</p>
         
         <p>As regards the fight against unemployment, the government appeared to be only partly successful. The rate of unemployment decreased in 2006 due largely to changes in the conditions affecting the long‐term unemployed. However, the government did not succeed in modifying labour market regulation. On 16 January, the Prime Minister created a new work contract for young people aged 18–25. Called the ‘First Employment Contract’, it made it easier for employers to lay off young workers: each young person would sign a two‐year contract as a sort of trial period; during these two years, employers could break the contract whithout any justification. This measure would loosen a ‘rigid employment code’ held responsible for France's high rate of unemployment. Immediately, students, pupils and trade unions opposed the project. In February and March, many universities and grammar schools experienced strikes and large demonstrations were organised all over France. Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin remained firm and the bill was voted through by deputies and the senators. Published by the Official Journal on 2 April, the new contract was, however, first replaced by a new text and then disappeared when President Chirac announced ten days later that neither the first nor the second would be applied.</p>
         
         <p>The main casualty was De Villepin, who had been the initiator of the project and had tried to steer the bill against the opposition of the young people in education, trade unionists and leftist parties as well as a part of his government and parliamentary party. The crisis increased the rivalry between the Prime Minister and Sarkozy, who at the time were both potential candidates for the next presidential election. De Villepin's approval rating, which had climbed to a high of 45 per cent at the end of 2005, fell to 24 per cent in April according to SOFRES polls, making it unlikely that he would run for the presidency.</p>
         
         <p>The issues were the same in the second part of the year, but were carried out less by the government than by the potential runners for the presidency. After the defeat of De Villepin, Sarkozy had no real contenders within the conservative UMP Party and was detached from Chirac's camp. On 29 November, as expected, he announced that he would be a candidate. All the issues at stake in 2002–2006 were the same, but the UMP candidate – to be ratified by a vote within the party forecast for January 2007 – stressed that he would break from Chirac's course. This change would be a question of style, but also of the will to modify economic, social and cultural values in order to fall into line with the policies of other developed countries. Therefore the main focus was to reconcile the French people with work, respect and order.</p>
         
         <p>In order to appoint its candidate, the Socialist Party followed its democratic process: a vote by the party membership. Three candidates ran in this ‘primary’ election. Laurent Fabius represented the ‘leftist’ faction, which had supported a ‘no’ vote in the 2005 referendum and stressed that the party had to develop a social programme to fit the demands of the people. Dominique Strauss‐Khann would be a social‐democratic contender along the lines of the German, Spanish and Nordic Socialist parties. Ségolène Royal – who had announced her potential candidacy in the the fall of 2005 – was not so well known or identified with the traditional lines of the Socialist factions. One of her campaign themes was precisely to be free from the party programme and from the party leaders. She won the race with 60.7 per cent of the vote on 16 November. She was supported by the new members of the party (80,000 in 2006) who wanted to change either the party machine or the party programme. Once declared the party's candidate, Royal stressed two issues. The first was a new kind of democracy not based only on the party's and the nation's representative elites, but directly on the people. To implement this ‘participative democracy’, Royal maintained an interactive website and organised lots of meetings where people could voice their concerns and ideas. At the level of the nation, the Socialist candidate argued that randomly selected citizens’ juries would watch over government policies and more generally over the representative elites.</p>
         
         <p>The second issue was a ‘fair order’ based on four pillars: education; the fight against casual and insecure jobs and violence; the environment and the standard of living. However, in this first part of her campaign, Royal emphasised values of her own largely foreign to the French Socialist tradition: nation, family and order. Some proposals such as juvenile delinquents being placed in educational camps run by the military stunned the party. However, it became clear that Royal would compete with Sarkozy on issues that had been at the top of the agenda for many years. At the end of 2006, the two front runners for the 2007 presidential election made clear that French politics could be undergoing a major shift. A new generation emerged with a will to break from the taboos held by their respective parties and France in general.</p>
