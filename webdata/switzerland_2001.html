         <p>On 31 December 2002, Federal Councilor Ruth Dreifuss, representing the Canton of Geneva and the Social Democratic Party, resigned. The choice of her replacement did not raise the same level of excitement as previous choices, and the so‐called ‘magic formula’ was maintained without problems. The Social Democratic Party presented two female candidates: Micheline Calmy‐Rey from Geneva and Ruth Lüthi from Fribourg. The Swiss Peoples Party (SVP), which is the country's most powerful party, continued to demand a second representative. This was emphasized by the candidacy of Toni Bortoluzzi, national representative from Zurich. However, he received no more than 69 votes and dropped out after the fourth ballot. Micheline Calmy‐Rey, (born 8 July 1945) was elected on the fifth ballot with 131 votes.</p>

         <p>As Swiss parliamentary elections had taken place in 1999, there were no major changes in 2002. One member of the upper house died; two members of the lower house and Social Democratic Party resigned in 2002. With one substitute, Pascale Bruderer (SP, canton Aargau), Parliament experienced some refreshment. The new member, born in 1977, is currently the youngest.</p>

         <p>In 2002, Swiss voters were asked to cast a ballot nine times on the occasion of four popular decisions; five of these were based on constitutional initiatives.</p>
         
         <p>The start of the political year 2002 was very international and, in terms of the institutional setting, unusual as well. Ten years after the popular vote against Swiss participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) and sixteen years after the first attempt to join the United Nations (UN), membership in this international body was again on the agenda. In March 2000, an all‐party committee launched the popular initiative ‘For the Entry of Switzerland into the UNO’. Even though the so‐called ‘<i>Vernehmlassungsverfahren</i>’ (interrogation of most parties and political, as well as economic, organizations) revealed strong support and experts were almost sure in predicting a good majority of votes from the electorate, the majority of cantons was predicted to be slim. Indeed, while 54.6 per cent of the voters cast a ‘yes’ vote, the cantonal majority passed by a narrow margin (12 to 11).<a href="#t1%20#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>A closer look at the results reveals many similarities to the EEA vote. The French‐speaking part of Switzerland supported UN membership with more than 60 per cent of the vote. In the German‐speaking part of Switzerland, the urban cantons such as Basel‐Stadt (64.1 per cent), Zürich, Fribourg, Bern, Zug and Luzern voted ‘yes’, while the cantons of central and eastern Switzerland voted against. Compared to the clear ‘no’ vote of 1986, a new gap has opened between rural communities and urban areas within the German‐speaking part of Switzerland. At the individual level, as with the EEA, right‐wing voters were almost all against. Also in terms of mobilization, the ballot followed the patterns of the EEA vote in December 1992; the 57.5 per cent turnout was the highest since the EAA referendum that mobilized 78.7 per cent of the electorate. Both UN supporters and opponents were equally able to mobilize (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2002</a></span>, <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2003</a></span>).

         <p>Regarding the institutional setting, this was the rare situation in which a popular initiative is not only accepted by the majority of the voters (see the Switzerland entry in <i>Political Data Yearbook 2000</i>), but also supported by the federal council. Whereas the first has happened only 13 times since the introduction of the popular initiative, and underlines that initiatives usually function to stimulate negotiation and bargaining before the popular vote, support of the federal government is even more exceptional. The argument that UN membership and Swiss neutrality are compatible was most convincing. In contrast to the vote of 1986 when 54 per cent of the voters were convinced that Swiss neutrality was at stake, in 2002 only 28 per cent of the voters thought that UN membership was incompatible with neutrality.
         </p>
         
         <p>The popular initiative ‘For Shorter Working Hours’, launched by the Swiss Trade Union in 1988 and asking for a maximum of 1,872 hours of work per year, had no chance. The argument that a reduction in working hours would have positive effects on family life was supported, but without an impact on voting behavior. Furthermore, the initial argument, that the implementation of the initiative would allow the distribution of labor among more people and therefore reduce unemployment, was not accepted by a majority, even among left‐wing voters. Rather, the quite general fear of a serious economic backlash was decisive.</p>
         
         <p>On 2 June, Swiss voters were asked to decide about the right to abortion. The Swiss Parliament presented the ‘Revision of the Swiss Penal Code and the Articles Regarding Abortion’ after an eight‐year debate. It introduced a right to abortion with a legal upper time limit of the first twelve weeks. After this, abortion is only possible in order to protect pregnant women against severe physical harm or psychological emergency and requires a medical certificate. In contrast to this attempt to decriminalize abortion, the popular initiative ‘For Mother and Child’, launched by pro‐life groups, called for a constitutional article banning all abortions, even in cases of rape. The only exception was in the case of danger to the life of the pregnant woman. The initiative was uniformly rejected, with the best results in the cantons of Valais (32 per cent ‘yes’) and Uri (30 per cent). In addition, 72 per cent of the voters approved decriminalization of abortion. Comparison to a similar referendum held in 1977 corroborates a profound change in Swiss society, mainly among Catholics (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Engeli et al. 2002</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The September ballot concerned two issues with three ballots. The first issue was about the revenues of the Swiss National Bank that were no longer used for monetary policy and therefore could serve other ends. In 1997, Federal President Arnold Koller launched the idea of a Swiss Solidarity Fund committed to the Swiss humanitarian tradition with the main task of fighting poverty and violence. In contrast to this, the Swiss People's Party launched the popular ‘Gold Initiative’ and argued that all revenues, as well as any surplus, should be transferred exclusively to the old age pensioners’ and survivors’ insurance fund (AHV). The federal government, as well as Parliament, opposed this initiative and started to work out a counterproposal: ‘Gold for AHV, Cantons and Solidarity Fund’. They wanted to deposit the special assets from the sale of 1,300 tones of surplus gold in a fund in order to preserve the money for future generations. The income, on the other hand, (about SFr 500 to 700 million per year) was to be distributed in equal shares to the cantons, the AHV and the Swiss Solidarity Fund. However, a slim majority was against both proposals. The Gold Initiative was defeated with 51.1 per cent ‘no’ votes, the counterproposal with 52 per cent ‘no’ votes. As the post‐vote VOX Analysis reveals, voters’ decisions were determined by party identification and the idea of the Swiss Solidarity Fund that came up during the Holocaust discussions was the sticking point (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mahnig &amp; Milic 2002</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The ‘Energy Market Law’ was a phased deregulation project for the Swiss electricity market with accompanying measures for small electricity consumers and renewable energy sources. Swiss Trade Unions launched the referendum. They were convinced that liberalization would lead to higher prices and endanger the ‘public service’; 52.6 per cent of the voters agreed with them. However, the referendum has to be interpreted as a fundamental disagreement with liberalization and voters lacking trust in government cast a ‘no’ vote as well (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mahnig &amp; Milic 2002</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In November 2002, attention turned to two social groups in Switzerland – asylum‐seekers and the jobless. The Swiss People's Party (SVP) took up its election victory policy again. The most important aim of the initiative ‘Against the Abuse of Asylum Rights’ was to establish a rule according to which applications from persons coming from a safe third‐party state (e.g., all countries neighboring Switzerland) would not be acceptable. Even though Federal Council and Parliament stated that this radical regulation could never be implemented and stands in sharp contradiction to the Swiss humanitarian tradition and international law, the outcome of the ballot was exceptionally narrow (50.1 per cent) with a rather high mobilization (48 per cent). Correspondingly, the voter survey revealed that the goal of a more restrictive asylum policy is not disputed, but rather the way to get there (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The reform of the Unemployment Insurance Law was overshadowed by the emotional asylum laws debate. The reduction of the salary deductions and shortening of maximum insurance duration in order to prevent a deficit of roughly SFr. 1 billion raised the protests of the trade unions and the Left that had launched the referendum. However, solidarity with the jobless was scarce. Voters’ analysis of the topic was rather superficial and they mostly followed the parties’ slogans (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2003</a></span>). Some 56.1 per cent supported the reform. In the western and French‐speaking part of Switzerland, with stronger left‐wing parties and higher unemployment, the opposition was more pronounced (Jura: 62 per cent ‘no’; Geneva: 54 per cent ‘no’; Neuchâtel and Valais: 52 per cent ‘no’).

         <p>Swiss national politics were dominated by the general economic situation. The average growth rate of Switzerland in the 1990s (1.2 per cent) clearly lagged behind that of the Member States of the European Union (EU). All parties therefore asked for analysis of the reasons. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs published the so‐called ‘Growth Report’ and the <i>Avenir Suisse</i> think tank published a book about the implications of the Swiss ‘<i>Alleingang</i>’ after the ‘no’ to the EAA (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Wagschal et al. 2002</a></span>). Both agree that the high prices for domestic products, the growing government expenditure rate, a lowering of productivity and unemployment are pivotal factors. However, regarding the consequences of the ‘no’ to the EAA, state authorities and the Swiss Business Federation, on the one hand, and private think tanks, on the other, differed slightly. While the former points out the positive effect of bilateral agreements, <i>Avenir Suisse</i> is more critical.
