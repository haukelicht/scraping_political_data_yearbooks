         <p>At the end of 2010 the Green Party announced that it would seek the dissolution of the Dáil following the passage of the budget in early 2011 (see O'Malley <span><a href="#epdy16-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy16-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). It was clear that Fianna Fáil was annoyed at the unilateral decision to announce when an election might take place, as the party's leadership felt that the government could continue at least until the late spring. However, the decision to seek a loan under an EU/IMF (European Union/International Monetary Fund) programme to allow the state to fund its activities shocked many in the country – not least because government ministers had issued emphatic denials in the days before the announcement. Also, a series of by‐elections were due which would almost certainly have removed the shaky majority had by the government.
         </p>
         
         <p>In January it was clear that the budget would pass, and a timetable was agreed with opposition parties to expedite the passage of the Finance Bill, which might not normally be complete until early April. Fianna Fáil's very poor showing in opinion polls and the likelihood of an imminent election led to intense speculation about Brian Cowen's leadership. He placed a motion of confidence in his own leadership. Micheál Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, spoke against the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and Martin's offer of resignation was accepted by Cowen when the confidence motion passed (the voting figures were not disclosed).</p>
         
         <p>Emboldened by this victory and in an apparent attempt to revitalise the government ahead of the inevitable, but as yet unscheduled, election, Cowen sought and received the resignations of five ministers who had announced that they would not seek re‐election in the forthcoming election. His plan was to replace them with younger TDs (MPs) who he presumably thought would get a boost in profile and might increase their chances of re‐election. Some reports had it that a TD who was offered a promotion turned it down. It may have been one of the few cases in political history where backbenchers were avoiding a Prime Minister's call in case they were offered a cabinet post! The Green Party suggested that this would be seen as a cynical move and one that it would not support (new ministers must receive the endorsement of the Dáil), effectively ending that plan. Cowen complained bitterly that he was being denied his constitutional prerogative to name ministers, but as he had effectively lost the confidence of the Dáil he lost these prerogatives.</p>
         
         <p>Questions about his leadership opened again, and some TDs let it be known that they were sorry they had voted to support Cowen a few days earlier. On 22 January, less than a week after winning a confidence motion, Brian Cowen stepped down as leader of Fianna Fáil, but remained as Taoiseach. The Greens now declared that their patience was at an end and announced their withdrawal from government. The resignations of the party's two cabinet ministers meant the number of ministers was now seven – the constitutionally prescribed minimum.</p>
         
         <p>On 26 January Fianna Fáil TDs elected Micheál Martin as party leader, beating three of his former cabinet colleagues: Mary Hanafin, Éamon Ó Cuiv and Brian Lenihan. He appointed a new front bench to contest the election, which included some people who held no elected office. After the Finance Bill was passed, on 1 February the Taoiseach advised the President to dissolve the Dáil and the election was set for Friday, 25 February. The campaign itself was dominated by one thing: the economy. It was clear that Fianna Fáil was going to have a bad election and for the first time did not field enough candidates to win an overall majority (for a full treatment of the election, see Gallagher and Marsh <span><a href="#epdy16-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy16-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). Labour, which had competed in polls with Fine Gael for being the most popular party in the country, put some focus on its leader who polls indicated was the most popular choice for the office of Taoiseach. Fine Gael, whose leader Enda Kenny had been challenged for the leadership of his party the previous summer, was generally regarded as a poor candidate for Taoiseach, and Fine Gael strategists seemed to agree as they minimised the number of appearances Kenny made where he could be subject to a sustained interrogation. Kenny missed the first leaders’ debate and, despite efforts by Fianna Fail to castigate him, it did not seem to make an appreciable difference to Fine Gael's poll ratings. Kenny used a meeting with German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, as a photo‐opportunity to make him appear as a statesman. Meanwhile, the daily press briefings the party gave were dominated by senior party figures. Fine Gael emphasised that Kenny was leading a team. It also unveiled a ‘five‐point plan’ and Fine Gael candidates seemed to start the answer to almost any question posed to them with ‘Fine Gael has a five‐point plan …’.
         </p>
         
         <p>Though there were many campaign events and more leadership debates than in any previous election, the campaign was quite subdued. It became clear that Labour's strategy of pushing its leader as the best candidate for Taoiseach was not working, either because he was in fact losing popularity or because the leader was not as important in an election taking place against a backdrop of financial crisis. Labour changed tack towards the end of the campaign and started to attack Fine Gael, claiming that its policies would hurt the worse off most. Fine Gael responded by accepting that under whatever government was formed it was ‘going to be dreadful’, but claiming Labour would put more emphasis on tax rises than would Fine Gael. Fine Gael had made some gains in the early part of the campaign and held on to these. Fianna Fáil was engaged in a desperate attempt to maintain support, but as it acknowledged that it was not going to be in government, it could not really appeal to anything other than loyalty to the party.</p>
         
         <p>Although the Fianna Fáil result shocked most observers – losing 58 seats from its 2007 result – in fact one might make the case that its vote of 17.4 per cent was remarkably strong given the scale of financial disaster. Fianna Fáil's poor seat return for its first preference vote was in large part due to the fact that it received very few transfers from other candidates – the proportional representation single‐transferrable vote (PR‐STV) electoral system used in Ireland asks voters to rank order candidates. However, this was the first time since the 1920s that Fianna Fáil was not the largest party, and falling to third place represented a psychological shock that the party will struggle to overcome. It was even gloomier for Fianna Fáil's coalition partners, the Greens, who lost all six of their seats and faced the difficult task of rebuilding without parliamentary representation.</p>
         
         <p>Fine Gael was the unquestionable winner of the election with 76 seats, but it fell short of a majority and its first preference vote was lower than it had achieved in the early 1980s. Labour, too, had a good election, with its best result in modern times, but it was possibly disappointed not to have challenged Fine Gael for status as the largest party. Of the other parties, Sinn Féin continued its steady rise; the party's ‘slow growth’ strategy appeared to be paying off. Also on the left, the loose coalition of parties under the United Left Alliance umbrella managed five seats in the new Dáil. Independents also did well. These were mainly community based, left‐leaning representatives, but some are clearly on the right. The election was one of the most volatile in postwar Europe (29.6 per cent) and the most volatile where no new significant party emerged (Mair <span><a href="#epdy16-bib-9001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy16-bib-9001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>).

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy16-sec-0003-title"> Cabinet and party changes</h2>
         
         <p>Immediately after the results became clear, Fine Gael and Labour opened negotiations on the formation of a government. Fine Gael had other options and could have sought to gather a number of independents to support a Fine Gael minority government, but given the scale of the task awaiting the party it felt it better to have a broad‐based coalition with a secure majority. Labour, too, might have felt that remaining in opposition would allow it to challenge to become the largest party in the state at the following election. The Labour leadership said that having claimed in the latter stages of the campaign that it could effectively act as a brake on Fine Gael in government, it would be irresponsible to eschew this obligation. The decision may also have had to do with the age profile of Labour's leadership.</p>
         
         <p>Labour acknowledged that Fine Gael had effectively won the election and Fine Gael came out better in the negotiations that followed. In office rewards it got ten of the fifteen seats in cabinet. In policy terms though there was an acknowledged fudge on the issue of where the cuts would fall; Fine Gael secured guarantees against rises in a number of taxes, which meant in effect that the closing of the deficit would come primarily from budget cuts.</p>
         
         <p>On March 9 Enda Kenny was elected Taoiseach by a majority of 117 votes to 27, the largest margin ever. Although neither party had been in government for close to 14 years, most of the cabinet had ministerial experience. The new cabinet was notable by its age (median: 59) and the absence of women (just two), something that caused some comment. It increased speculation that one might expect a significant reshuffle in mid‐term to enable younger members to gain cabinet experience. The government was not a new combination of parties, such as had been seen in 2007. Labour and Fine Gael had coalesced to form governments in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Initial reports were that the cabinet was very cohesive and that Kenny, often ridiculed as a weak leader, was an effective chairman of the cabinet. Yet it was not clear whether the government intended to contest the following election seeking a new mandate.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy16-sec-0004-title"> Presidential election of October 2011</h2>
         
         <p>In October, Ireland elected Michael D. Higgins as ninth President of Ireland (for an analysis of the election, see O'Malley <span><a href="#epdy16-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy16-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). Although directly elected, the post is largely ceremonial, and an indication of its irrelevance can be seen in that in 2004 none of the parties nominated anyone to challenge the incumbent, Mary McAleese. She was limited to two seven‐year terms, so an election had to take place. A record seven candidates contested the election, although Fianna Fáil, which had won the office on all but one of the occasions where there was an election, chose not to contest the election this time.
         </p>
         
         <p>The nomination process is quite restrictive in that one needs the support of twenty parliamentarians or four county or city councils. The latter route was used for the first time in 1997, but four of the candidates (all independents) availed themselves of it this time. The initial favourite for the post, David Norris, was embroiled in a controversy about his attitudes on pederasty which, when coupled with revelations that he wrote letters to plead clemency for a former lover guilty of raping a minor in Israel, led to the resignation of many in his campaign team. He withdrew from the race, only to later re‐enter but he had lost much of his support.</p>
         
         <p>The election campaign was much more dramatic than the general election. The entry of former Irish Republican Army leader and Deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, saw some emphasis on his past, but all candidates were subject to intense scrutiny about their past behaviour and opinions. Seán Gallagher, an independent candidate who had previously had close connections with Fianna Fáil, established himself as the frontrunner midway through the short campaign, but in a television debate he struggled to recall whether he had solicited money on behalf of Fianna Fáil (something that was not illegal, but which he had previously denied) and his support seemed to flow away. In the end, Higgins, who had consistently polled in the early to mid‐20s, saw his support jump. In a different field he might have been regarded as quite eccentric – a long time politician, he is a poet, academic and public intellectual – but in this context he looked like the most suitable candidate for many. Following the elimination of other candidates, lower preferences went heavily to Higgins in what ended up being a comfortable victory.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy16-sec-0005-title"> Results of national referenda</h2>
         
         <p>On the same day as the presidential election, two referendums were held to change the constitution. One related to the ongoing attempt to close the deficit. All public sector workers had effectively taken pay cuts through levies imposed to fund the state's growing pension commitments. Judges were exempt from this because it was decided in government that to impose these levies on judges might constitute a reduction in judges’ remuneration – something explicitly prescribed by the constitution. The decision to have a referendum on the reduction of judicial pay was in part to ensure that there was social solidarity rather than to actually save money. In fact, most judges had voluntarily taken pay cuts, and it was not clear that any judges could have made a decision on the constitutionality of imposing the levies given the obvious conflict of interest. In an unprecedented move, the judiciary had written and published a memorandum expressing annoyance at the proposed amendment to allow the reduction of judicial pay and did not suggest that the government should test the pension levy by imposing it. Perhaps in part because of the judges’ memorandum there was a clear public majority in favour of the amendment and it passed comfortably.</p>
         
         <p>The second referendum held that day was on the right of the Oireachtas (parliament) to conduct inquiries into matters of public importance. The right of the Oireachtas was called into question by an earlier legal judgment which found that a committee had exceeded its rights in inquiring into the shooting dead of a man by <i>gardaí</i> (police) in Abbeylara. While the Abbeylara judgement did not rule out all inquiries, the Oireachtas effectively stopped holding inquiries. Given the central role of the banking sector and how it was regulated, there was some demand among parliamentarians and the public that these should be investigated. As such this was a proposal which polls showed a clear majority of people supported. However, subsection four of the proposed amendment said: ‘It shall be for the House or Houses concerned to determine, with due regard to the principles of fair procedures, the appropriate balance between the rights of persons and the public interest for the purposes of ensuring an effective inquiry.’ This meant that witnesses were unlikely to have recourse to the courts should they so wish. This was not helped by the fact that the courts had recently overturned a ruling by one of its committees that had sanctioned a member for his expenses claims. A small campaign ensued with academics and civil liberties groups warning about the implications of this subsection. A letter from former Attorneys General to a newspaper received quite a bit of attention. This shoestring campaign managed to overturn a clear lead for the government's proposal, though the government parties concentrated on the presidential election and put few resources into the campaign on the issue. This embarrassed the government, which had campaigned in the general election on a promise of reforming the political system.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy16-sec-0006-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Ireland faced a more serious fiscal crisis than even that of the 1980s. The new government had something of an extended honeymoon, enjoying the visits of the British monarch and American President. It also negotiated reductions in the interest payments on the loans which were part of the EU/IMF/ECB (European Central Bank) programme. These offered potential long‐term savings to the Irish state, but that programme required the government to make savings or increase taxes in order to cut the country's growing deficit. More stress tests of banks forced the government to agree further recapitalisation of the Irish banks, bringing to over €70 billion the cost of bank bail‐out. This was embarrassing for the government as it had spent much of the campaign promising not to give any more money to the banks.</p>
         
         <p>The government was also forced to concede that it could not impose losses on bondholders of the Irish banks. Though it wanted to and campaigned on this, Jean‐Claude Trichet of the ECB effectively ruled this out. During the election campaign, the Labour Party leader, Éamon Gilmore, showed little appreciation for the independence of the ECB in describing Trichet as a civil servant who would do what his political masters told him. In a famous phrase, he said it would be ‘Frankfurt's way or Labour's way’. Trichet's refusal to allow losses on bondholders underlined the loss of sovereignty for Ireland.</p>
         
         <p>The inability to get concessions on this issue and the fiscal condition Ireland was in meant that savings had to be found to cut the deficit. The government announced a series of privatisations of state assets – again something Labour had campaigned against. In the December budget a series of cuts and new taxes were projected to close the deficit by €3.8 billion in 2012. These included a new property tax, something that was expected to be controversial, and which the left‐wing opposition parties vowed to campaign against. It was also suggested that water charges would be introduced. The cuts claimed a number of casualties in the government parties. A junior Minister for Housing, Willie Penrose, who sat at cabinet, resigned his ministerial position in protest at the closure of an army barracks in his constituency. A Fine Gael TD resigned the party whip over the closure of services in a hospital in his constituency. Two other Labour TDs lost the party whip for not voting with the government. This included a TD who had been elected weeks earlier in a by‐election caused by the death of the former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan. His death left Fianna Fáil without any Dáil representation in Dublin. Labour won the by‐election, which took place in late October. This was the first time a government party had won a by‐election since 1982.</p>
         
         <p>The Moriarty Tribunal into the payments to certain politicians issued its final report in 2011. It had been sitting since 1997 and was the subject of some controversy as the judge was forced to recant some earlier preliminary findings, leading some of those being investigated to call it a ‘witch‐hunt’. The report found that former Fine Gael Minster for Communications, Michael Lowry, secured the second mobile phone licence for Denis O'Brien's Esat Digifone in 1995. Lowry had resigned from the party, but was still a TD.</p>
         
         <p>The Cloyne Report outlined, yet again, the failure of the Catholic Church to deal with allegations of sexual abuse. Although it did not reveal anything new, it was an official report and so demanded a reaction. The Taoiseach, himself a devout Catholic, excoriated the Church for its attitude in a speech to the Dáil that was well received. Relations with the Church remained cool as the government announced the closure of its embassy to the Vatican as a cost‐saving measure. The new Minister for Education also outlined that he would attempt to secure changes to school patronage. Over 90 per cent of primary schools in Ireland are run by the Catholic Church, even though the number of practising Catholics has fallen significantly.</p>
