         <p>The year 2004 was an important year for Portugal. First, it celebrated thirty years of democracy. This was a reason for pride for both the political elites and the population. Celebrations took place throughout the year, culminating on 25 April: the anniversary of the day the authoritarian regime was toppled by the Movement of Armed Forces. Second, the organisation of the Football European Championship Finals in Portugal was a major event of pride and achievement for Portugal. As such, it was expected that the event would lead to overcoming the economic, political and social crisis in which the country was embroiled.</p>
         
         <p>After the legislative elections of 2002, the right‐centre coalition government consisting of the liberal Social Democratic Party and the conservative People's Party introduced major austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit below ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP allowed by the European Monetary Union convergence criteria and monitored by the European Commission. In spite of many drastic austerity measures and cuts, the government was only able to keep slightly below the ceiling: 2.8–2.9 per cent of GDP at the end of 2003. The consequences of the austerity measures were that the country ended the year with negative growth and rising unemployment. The left‐wing parliamentary opposition led by the Socialist Party and supported by the Communist Party and the Bloc of the Left were adamant in asking the government to introduce social measures to alleviate the burden of the austerity measures upon the poorer segments of the population.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Elections to the European Parliament</h2>
         
         <p>The first major test for the government was the European Parliament (EP) elections on 13 June. The government parties decided to create an electoral coalition called ‘<i>Força Portugal</i>’ which was inspired by the successful formula used by media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi when he created <i>Forza Italia</i>. The government parties were using opportunistically the hopes of the population that Portugal would do well in the European championships. This footballisation of the campaign by the government was highly criticised by the opposition parties. The head of the list of <i>Força Portugal</i> was the former Portuguese Commissioner João Deus Pinheiro. The Socialist Party was headed by the former president of the Audit Court and minister in the Guterres government, António Sousa Franco. Unfortunately, he died exhausted while campaigning on 8 July in the northern town of Matosinhos, some days before the election. The Socialist Party presented a very European programme in concert with other Socialist parties affiliated in the European Socialist Party. The Communist Party mainly criticised the austerity measures of the government and Prime Minister Barroso's decision to support the war in Iraq in March 2003. Similarly, the Bloc of the Left also campaigned against the policies of the government. Both parties emphasised the need to conduct a referendum on the European constitutional treaty and move towards the social Europe agenda.
         </p>
         
         <p>In total, 19 parties took part in the European Parliament elections. Throughout the campaign, opinion polls predicted a victory for the Socialist Party; the only question was how big this majority would be. The Socialist Party was able to improve slightly in relation to 1999 by achieving 46.4 per cent of the vote. The big surprise was the collapse of the vote for both coalition parties. In comparison to 1999, they together lost 6 per cent, achieving only 34.6 per cent and nine seats. The big loser naturally was the People's Party, while the Communist Party was able to keep their losses under control by achieving 9.5 per cent and two seats. The other surprise was the continuing expansion of the Bloc of the Left from election to election. The Bloc was able to achieve 5.1 per cent and one seat, thus improving on their results in 1999 (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Magone 2005</a></span>; <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Lobo 2002</a></span>).

         <p>The defeat of the centre‐right government in the EP elections led to rumours that Prime Minister Barroso wanted to undertake a major reshuffle (<i>Expresso</i>, 19 June 2004). The reshuffle never took place because the Council of the European Union asked him to become the new President of the European Commission. Barroso resigned from the government and took up the position. He argued for the continuation of the centre‐right government under a new prime minister and proposed his long‐time friend Pedro Santana Lopes for the position. President Jorge Sampaio spoke to the different political parties before reaching a decision. In the end, he decided to allow the centre‐right government to continue in view of the need for stability in the implementation of the austerity measures. This led to the resignation of the leader of the Socialist Party, Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, who hoped that the president would call for new elections due to the unpopularity of the government and the mood of the country (<i>Expresso</i>, 10 July 2004). He was replaced by José Socrates, who was also a former minister of the Guterres government and highly popular within the Socialist Party and among the population. He was confirmed leader at a party conference in November 2004.
         </p>
         
         <p>The new Santana Lopes government was sworn in on 23 July, although there was strong resistance from the opposition and inside the Social Democratic Party as well. The new government was committed to the policies of austerity of the Barroso government. In spite of continuity of policies, there were major personnel changes in the government. Only four members of the previous cabinet were kept, and the new cabinet included 15 new members. The government was also larger than Barroso’s. While the Barroso government had only 18 members, Santana Lopes increased it to 20. Among the most prominent new members was the independent former Ambassador to the United Nations, António Monteiro, who was assigned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
         
         <p>In the autumn, the new Santana Lopes government tried to gain ground, but the opposition to the highly unpopular centre‐right government grew throughout the second half of the year. The change of leadership in the PS and the election of a new more conciliatory leader, Jerónimo de Sousa, in the Communist Party after the 17th party conference on 26 and 28 November, strengthened the position of the opposition parties in the opinion polls.</p>

         <p>A further test for the centre‐right government came from the elections in the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores, which were normally strongholds of the PSD and the CDS‐PP. Indeed, the centre‐right parties decided to form an electoral coalition in the Azores. In Madeira, the charismatic president of the region, Alberto João Jardim, who is also the leader of PSD‐Madeira, decided to compete separately from the CDS‐PP. The electoral results were quite encouraging for the PS, which was able to make gains in the two archipelagos. In the Azores, the PS was able to increase its absolute majority by eight points, achieving 57.0 per cent of vote and 31 seats, in contrast to 36.8 per cent and 21 seats for the right‐centre coalition, which together lost 9.6 per cent of the vote in relation to the previous elections of 2000. No other party was able to achieve representation, creating for the first time a two‐party system. President Carlos César from the Socialist Party was able to build on the absolute majority acquired in 2000. In Madeira, President Jardim was able to hold onto power with an absolute majority of 53.7 per cent, losing 2.2 per cent in relation to the 2000 elections. Although this majority is quite high, the PSD has been experiencing a downward trend since the mid‐1980s, when Jardim won the election with a record 67 per cent. The Socialist Party was able to achieve 27.41 per cent of the vote, up by 7.5 per cent in relation to the previous election. The CDS‐PP declined from 9.7 to 7 per cent (two seats), the Communist Party went up from 4.6 to 5.5 per cent (two seats) and the Bloc of the Left was able to achieve representation with 3.7 per cent and one seat.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> The resignation of the Santana Lopes government and the call for new elections</h2>
         
         <p>After this further negative sign at end of October, the Santana Lopes government had difficulties retaining authority inside the PSD. Leaders of the party expressed growing dissatisfaction with the government. Moreover, President Sampaio disapproved of the government project to create a governmental Communication Agency, which he regarded as dangerous for the freedom of the press. Indeed, some days before, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, one of the most vociferous critics of Prime Minister Santana Lopes, had to resign from his weekly role as a political commentator on the private television channel TVI, allegedly due to pressure by the government on the director of the broadcasting enterprise. The major instigator was Minister of the Presidency Manuel Gomes da Silva, who President Sampaio wanted Santana Lopes to remove from government. Instead, Santana Lopes wanted to keep the minister by putting him in a less visible position within the government. Santana Lopes tried to reshuffle the government by appointing a new Culture and Sports Minister, who was only informed of the appointment shortly before the ceremony. The Adjunct Minister to the Prime Minister, Henrique Chaves, was sworn in on 24 November, but a few days later the new minister resigned on the grounds that the Prime Minister had not honoured his promises with regard to the budget for the ministry. This led to a very negative intervention by former Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who indirectly voiced major criticisms of Santana Lopes in the weekly newspaper <i>Expresso</i> (<i>Expresso</i>, 27 November 2004). After another attempt to reshuffle the government, President Sampaio decided after consultation with the political parties and the Council of State that Santana Lopes should resign and call for early elections. Santana Lopes resigned on 2 December after the approval of the budget for 2005 in Parliament. The irony is that the economic figures for Portugal were beginning to improve; it seemed that the country was approaching the light at the end of the tunnel of recession.
