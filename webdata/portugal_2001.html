         <p>The resignation of Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, after a heavy defeat in local elections on 14 December 2001, led to the call for early elections by President Jorge Sampaio after consultation in the Council of State. The Guterres Government remained in power until the elections on 17 March 2002 as a caretaker government. The resignation was a surprise within the Socialist Party; Guterres even surprised his cabinet, who heard the news on television or shortly before he resigned. They tried desperately to find a successor. Among the favourite candidates was European Commissioner Antonio Vitorino, who rejected the offer. In the end, the party agreed on Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, who had been one of the long‐serving ministers of the Guterres Government since 1995. He had been Minister of Labour up until early 2001 and afterwards replaced Jorge Coelho as Minister of Social Infrastructures and Parliamentary Affairs. Ferro Rodrigues was of the same generation as Antonio Guterres, albeit identified as being ideologically further to the left than his predecessor. He became the new party leader after an extraordinary party conference before the legislative elections. Despite the short run‐up to the elections, Ferro Rodrigues was able to refer to the achievements of the Socialist Party during the past eight years, although the sudden departure of Guterres clearly complicated his bid for victory. Nevertheless, Ferro Rodrigues was able to put up a fight and achieve a respectable 37 per cent of the vote.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The main contender was Opposition leader Manuel Durǎo Barroso of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). Barroso capitalised heavily on the dire economic situation that Portugal was facing. He clearly saw Guterres's departure as letting the people down in the face of a difficult economic situation. He presented a catastrophic picture of Portugal, saying that it was diverging from the rest of the European Union (EU). In spite of this alarming discourse, Barroso was not able to achieve a strong majority in the elections. One of the main reasons is his low popularity with the Portuguese population in comparison to the other political leaders. His uncharismatic personality did not help him to achieve an absolute majority. On the contrary, Barroso had to form a coalition with the smaller Christian Democratic, anti‐Maastricht, Democratic Social Centre‐People's Party under the leadership of charismatic Paulo Portas. The latter was able to surpass the Communist Party in terms of votes and seats and become a credible coalition partner of the PSD.</p>
         
         <p>The Communist Party, in a coalition with the Greens, was the big loser of these elections, reducing its 1999 share of the vote by about 25 per cent. The main reason was the general feeling that the party still shows signs of orthodoxy in relation to potential dissenters. The negative impression of the way dissenters are ostracised contributed to the decline of the party. Party leader Carlos Carvalhas is extremely dependent on the <i>eminence grise</i>, Alvaro Cunhal, which does not help to achieve a renewal of the party. Moreover, a new formation called the ‘Block of the Left’, consisting of smaller extreme leftist parties, as well as new age parties, was able to compete for the left‐wing vote. The young leaders of this new political formation, Francisco Loudçǎ and Miguel Portas (brother of Paulo Portas), address issues related to the environment, poverty and aspects of international relations that interest younger voters and intellectuals in the larger towns of Lisbon, Setubal and Oporto. They were able to win 2.8 per cent of the vote and 3 seats.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Communists lost more than 100,000 votes in comparison to the legislative elections of 1999: about two‐thirds to the Socialist Party and one‐third to abstentions. The PSD won 420,000 more votes than in the last legislative elections: half from the Socialists, one‐tenth from the CDS‐PP and 40 per cent from people who abstained in the previous elections. As already mentioned, the Socialists lost heavily to the PSD, but they were able to win over 63,000 votes from the Communists. The Block of the Left won over a small number of voters from the Socialists and Communists, which allowed them to win a third seat in comparison to its two seats in 1999. Abstention went down slightly from 38.9 per cent in 1999 to 38.5 per cent in 2002.</p>
         
         <p>One conclusion from this election is that PS and PSD are sharing the same pool of voters in the centre of the spectrum. They are certainly members of the new middle classes, who may change easily from one party to the other because their ideologies are not so far apart, particularly after Guterres moved his party more in the direction of a Blairite Third Way. It is too early to tell what the approach of Ferro Rodrigues will be, but he certainly will draw some inspiration from Guterrismo.</p>
         
         <p>In terms of electoral geography, the PSD was able to improve its situation in the north, which is the main stronghold of the party, while the PS continues to contribute to the erosion of the Communist Party in the southern district of Alentejo by becoming the most popular party in the region. The PS lost heavily in the north, but made substantial gains in the south. Both the CDS‐PP and the Communist coalition are resisting, but they are losing votes from election to election. While the electorate of the CDS‐PP is very volatile and concentrated in the north, the voters of the PCP are less volatile, but they are ageing and concentrated in the south between Algarve and Lisbon. This clearly tells something about the party, which still resists renewing its leadership and ideological make‐up. The Block of the Left is an urban phenomenon; most of the voters are to be found in the coastal cities of Portugal. Abstention was concentrated in the interior regions of Portugal such as Trás os Montes, Beiras and Alentejo, as well as in the islands of Madeira and, in particular, Acores (<i>Expresso</i>, 23 March 2001; <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Freire &amp; Costa Lobo 2002</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In sum, the legislative elections confirmed the hegemony of the two main parties – PS and PSD – and the difficulties of the two smaller traditional parties – CDS‐PP and CDU – to continue to be relevant in Portuguese politics. The increase in the number of votes and seats for the Block of the Left may be regarded as a big success for the extreme left‐wing and new age parties, which up until 1999 had no representation and were very fragmented. They may be considered a fresh wind in the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic because of their introduction of new post‐materialist topics into Portuguese politics.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The new coalition government of Manuel Durǎo Barroso</h2>
         
         <p>PSD's failure to win an absolute majority in the legislative elections led to intensive negotiations with the CDS‐PP. The negotiations for the formation of a new government were concluded within a month. The overall programme of the new government was to reform public administration, reduce public spending drastically and develop a new strategy to revitalise the ailing Portuguese economy. In the coalition agreement, the junior partner was able to control three ministerial positions: defence, justice, and social security and labour. Some of the PSD ministers such as Marques Mendes, Luis Valente de Oliveira and Manuela Ferreira Leite had strong previous experience as members of the cabinets of Anibal Cavaco Silva between 1985 and 1995; others were junior ministers in the same cabinets. PSD leader Durǎo Barroso, supported by CDS‐PP leader Paulo Portas, presented the new government programme with a discourse about the catastrophic economic situation of Portugal (Programa do XI Governo Constitutional 2002).</p>
         
         <p>Once the Government had been sworn in, its first action was to find out about the real state of the country's finances. The iron lady of the PSD, Manuela Ferreira Leite, took charge of a superministry with responsibility both for the reform of public administration and the state and for finance. She was given drastic powers of control over the spending of public administration, including the local authorities. After first estimates by Ferreira Leite's team, it was discovered that Portugal had surpassed the 3 per cent GDP (gross domestic product) ceiling in the 2001 budget. The final estimate was 3.8 per cent. This naturally would lead to European Commission penalties if the Portuguese government could not reduce the deficit in ensuing budgets. In July, the European Commission came to a final figure of a 4.1 per cent budget deficit calculated by the EU statistical office. This led to further cuts in public spending throughout the year in order to keep the 2002 budget deficit below the 3 per cent ceiling (<i>Expresso</i>; <i>Economia</i>, 29 June 2002, pp. 3–5; <i>O Publico</i>, 12 July 2002, p. 25).
         </p>
         
         <p>Barroso's government was committed to major reforms and tried to get them approved in record time. Some were achieved without the support of the Opposition. This confrontational style became quite evident in the reform of public administration, which foresaw a freezing of further recruitment of civil servants and the redistribution and better use of those civil servants who were regarded as superfluous in certain services. This led to major conflicts with trade union representatives (<i>O Publico</i>, 4 July 2002, p. 2). Similarly, the Government cut the number of vacancies for schoolteachers in an effort to reduce the number of people working in that sector. The Government's intention to downsize Portuguese public television (<i>Radio Televisǎo Portuguesa‐RTP</i>) by closing down one or two of the channels to reduce costs was also controversial.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government's alarmist discourse negatively affected the economic situation in Portugal. Indeed, a recession was already felt in 2001, but it became even more pronounced in the first half of 2002. Prime Minister Durǎo Barroso countered the criticisms of the Opposition, who argued that the Government was responsible for the situation, with a huge package of programmes, most of them financed over the coming years with structural funds amounting to 1335 million. Most public works were related to the EU Common Support Framework and had to be implemented (<i>Diário de Noticias</i>, 7 July 2002, p. 6).
         </p>
         
         <p>In spite of these reforms and the package of public works, the Government remained quite unpopular among the population. Opinion surveys in July suggested that Barroso was not able to improve his own image or that of the Government. According to the weekly newspaper <i>Expresso</i>, the PSD trailed behind the opposition PS by 5 per cent. Durǎo Barroso was declining in terms of his personal rating from 40 per cent to 36 per cent, while Opposition leader Ferro Rodrigues's rating increased from 39 per cent to 40 per cent. The only positive sign for the Government was the personal rating of the CDS‐PP leader Paulo Portas, who was able to gain 5 per cent from 37 per cent to 42 per cent. The Government as a whole had a negative rating of 45 per cent (<i>Expresso</i>, 5 July 2002, p. 5).
         </p>
         
         <p>After the summer holidays, the Government remained quite unpopular among the population. Protests in the education sector characterised the month of September. Durǎo Barroso's leadership style in relation to the Opposition was very confrontational, which reinforced a negative image of the Government. The main trade union, the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (Confederação Geral dos Trabalhadores Portugueses‐CGTP/In), organised several strikes during the autumn, including a general strike on 10 December against the Government's austerity measures (<i>Keesing's Record of World Events</i>, October 2002, p. 35061; November 2002, p. 45114; December 2002, p. 45149). In November, the Government faced a scandal involving the Minister of Defence and leader of the CDS‐PP, Paulo Portas, who had been a teacher in the private University Moderna. The public prosecutor's case alleged that Paulo Portas had used the university's resources for the party. Although Paulo Portas was only invited as a witness in the trial against University Moderna, his conflict of interest during that period and nontransparent resource allocation in the CDS‐PP led to public outrage in the media. According to an opinion survey conducted by <i>Expresso</i>, 49 per cent of the respondents felt that he had lost credibility as Minister of Defence, while 44 per cent against 43 per cent believed that he ought to resign (<i>Expresso</i>, 1 November 2002).

         <p>In sum, the new coalition government had difficulties creating a positive image among the population due to the way they tackled the mounting problems of Portuguese public administration and economy. This strengthened the left‐wing opposition under the leadership of Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues.</p>

         <p>After the elections, the leaders of the two main parties prepared party conferences to consolidate their respective positions. The 24th party conference of the PSD took place between 12 and 14 July 2002 and was designed to strengthen the leadership of Manuel Durǎo Barroso. One of his internal party adversaries, predecessor Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, stayed away from the conference. This was a sign that not all parts of the party are supportive of Barroso. He clearly wanted to present the image that he will be in charge for a decade, like the PSD Governments of Cavaco Silva in the 1980s and 1990s. The party was not very enthusiastic about his leadership; on the contrary, the atmosphere was quite sober (<i>O Publico</i>, 12 July 2002, p. 2; 13 July 2002, p. 3).
         </p>
         
         <p>The 13th conference of the Socialist Party took place on 17 and 18 November 2002. The main aim was to end the cycle of uncertainty after former Prime Minister Antonio Guterres resigned in December 2001. Many of the Guterres supporters were removed from the leadership, while Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues consolidated his position as the new leader of the party. Guterres was regarded as a moderniser in the direction of the British New Labour Party. Ferro Rodrigues symbolised a shift to the left of the party. The party conference was used to set the coordinates for the European and local electoral campaigns in 2004 and 2005. The Socialist Party was able to come out of the conference more consolidated and prepared to offer an efficient opposition to the Government (<i>Expresso</i>, 23 November 2002; 30 November 2002).
