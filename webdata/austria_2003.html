         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss2"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss2-title"> Presidential election</h3>
            
            <p>The presidential election was the first since the controversial coalition between the Christian Democratic ÖVP and the right‐wing, populist FPÖ came to power in February 2000. The unsuccessful attempts of the incumbent President Thomas Klestil to prevent the FPÖ from entering government were still well remembered (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2001</a></span>); they had shown the restricted power of the office. The 2004 election was held at a time when opinion polls saw the opposition parties on the rise after government reforms (concerning pensions, railways, etc.), which were perceived as demonstrating ‘social coldness’, intensified political conflicts and provoked nationwide strikes organised by the trade unions (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2004b</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The ÖVP put forward Benita Ferrero‐Waldner, the incumbent Minister of Foreign Affairs, as its candidate. Having worked in the private economy at first, she had moved into the Foreign Service in 1984; in 1994 she advanced to the position of protocol chief of the United Nations. A year later, she returned to Austria to become state secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2000 she was appointed Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, the first Austrian woman to hold this post. Ferrero was already the fourth woman to have been nominated for the presidency (after Freda Meissner‐Blau for the Greens in 1986, Heide Schmidt for the FPÖ in 1992 and for the Liberals in 1998, and Gertraud Knoll, the head of the Protestant Church in the province of Burgenland, in 1998); she was, however, the first woman with a real chance to win.</p>
            
            <p>As generally expected, the Social Democrats (SPÖ) nominated Heinz Fischer, a university professor of political science and second president of the lower house of Parliament (<i>Nationalrat</i>). A member of Parliament since 1971, he had been chairman of the SPÖ's parliamentary party group from 1975 until 1983, and again from 1987 until 1990; in the time between he served as Federal Minister for Science and Research. In 1990 he reached the peak of his parliamentary career when he was elected first president of the <i>Nationalrat</i> (he was re‐elected three times). Since 1979 Fischer had also been deputy chairman of the SPÖ.
            </p>
            
            <p>The FPÖ and the Greens abstained from nominating candidates. For the FPÖ, the provincial elections in Carinthia and Salzburg, also due in the spring (see <a href="#ss6" class="scrollableLink"><b>Issues in national politics</b></a> below), had clear priority over the presidential election. The Greens originally thought of using the presidential campaign to build momentum for the provincial and the European elections, scheduled for two months later (see <a href="#ss3" class="scrollableLink"><b>Elections to the European Parliament</b></a> below). However, these considerations soon gave way to scepticism over whether an uncertain result would justify the financial costs. For a short time, Franz Fiedler, the widely respected president of the audit office and chairman of the ‘Austria Convention’ (see <a href="#ss5" class="scrollableLink"><b>Institutional changes</b></a> below), thought of running for president, claiming that leading ÖVP politicians, among them ministers, supported him. The former FPÖ party chairman, Jörg Haider, called him a serious candidate. Soon, however, Fiedler stepped down, officially because his supporters did not accept his condition of transparency with respect to his financial means.
            </p>
            
            <p>The SPÖ campaign centred on Fischer's experience as president of the <i>Nationalrat</i>, for which he had earned a reputation beyond party lines. In fact, Fischer questioned whether his rival Ferrero (as minister) disposed of the same impartiality. Furthermore, he claimed that his election would prevent the country from being ruled by a single party and establish a necessary power balance. His major campaign slogan was ‘politics needs conscience’, later modified to ‘the country needs more fairness’. Although the President has no power to veto laws passed by Parliament (except for cases in which the constitutional procedure for law‐making has been violated), he announced that he would fill the office with social competence and accused Ferrero of having agreed in cabinet to all the ‘unsocial’ reforms of recent years. With respect to foreign policy, Fischer stressed the traditional position of his party to uphold neutrality, even after the end of the Cold War and despite the participation of Austria in the EU's common foreign and security policy.
            </p>
            
            <p>The ÖVP campaign stressed the international experience of Ferrero. She was presented on posters as ‘the first (woman) who speaks with 101 state chiefs in their language’. Her strong defence of the new Austrian government against the so‐called ‘sanctions’ of the other 14 European Union governments in 2000 (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2001</a></span>) was used to prove her patriotism. Yet, the assertions of the ÖVP that it had been the efforts of the ‘lion’ Ferrero that had finally brought about the lifting of the ‘sanctions’ were as simplified as Fischer's claims that he had played a central role in the strategy shift of the EU‐14 (his party was, to say the least, not unhappy about the ‘sanctions’). Contrary to the past, when Ferrero advocated Austrian accession to NATO, she now pleaded for neutrality (obviously to be more in line with public opinion). Her intention to attract female voters by presenting herself as a ‘woman with heart’ was criticised both by Fischer (‘being a woman is not enough’) and by social democratic and green feminists, who accused her of not having cared about women's interests in the past. A few days before the election, leading FPÖ politicians, among them Vice Chancellor Hubert Gorbach, the managing party chairwoman Ursula Haubner and the Carinthian Governor and former party chairman Jörg Haider, announced that they would vote for Ferrero. Their support brought Ferrero a tough time, however, as she now had to balance between the mobilisation of young, urban female voters and FPÖ sympathisers.
            </p>
            
            <p>At 71.6 per cent, voter turnout reached an all‐time low in the history of presidential elections. Fischer won over Ferrero with 52.4 against 47.6 per cent of the votes. As exit polls indicated, the voters were split not only along party lines, but also along the government–opposition divide: 89 per cent of the SPÖ partisans voted for Fischer, 86 per cent of the ÖVP partisans for Ferrero. The percentage of FPÖ supporters who preferred Ferrero (74 per cent) was slightly higher than the percentage of Green supporters who preferred Fischer (69 per cent) (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Filzmaier &amp; Hajek 2005</a></span>: 14). The most important reasons given for voting for Fischer were ‘honesty and reliability’ (81 per cent), advocacy of ‘social issues’ and ‘small people’ (75 per cent), representation of ‘political balancing’ and ‘competence in constitutional matters’ (73 per cent each), while the Ferrero voters were above all convinced that she would ‘represent Austria well in foreign affairs’ (87 per cent) and that she had good ‘international contacts’ (85 per cent) (<span title=""><a href="#b8" id="#b8R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Plasser &amp; Ulram 2004a</a></span>: 14). The strategy of Ferrero's camp to play the ‘women's ticket’ did not pay off: the female electorate split its vote evenly between Fischer and Ferrero (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Filzmaier &amp; Hajek 2005</a></span>: 14).
            </p>
            
            <p>The two governing parties quarrelled over who was responsible for Ferrero's defeat. The strong man of the FPÖ, Jörg Haider, rejected speculations of leading ÖVP politicians (supported by pollsters) that the FPÖ's recommendation for Ferrero had proved counter‐productive. He indicated that Ferrero had won a majority in his homeland, Carinthia, and ascribed her defeat in the traditionally ÖVP‐dominated, rural provinces of Upper Austria, Lower Austria and Styria to the lack of efforts of the respective party organisations. The regional ÖVP politicians he attacked countered that Ferrero suffered from the negative social image of the federal ÖVP‐FPÖ government. The media, which had described the whole presidential campaign as boring, added fuel to the fire by pointing out that, including the provincial elections (see <a href="#ss6" class="scrollableLink"><b>Issues in national politics</b></a> below), the ÖVP had lost the third election in a row.
            </p>
            
            <p>The term of the new‐elected federal President started on 8 July. As his predecessor, Thomas Klestil, had died two days before, Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel acted for a short time as transitional President.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> Elections to the European Parliament</h3>
            
            <p>The elections to the European Parliament (EP) on 13 June (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2004a</a></span>) took place at a time when only 30 per cent of Austrians believed European Union (EU) membership to be a ‘good thing’; only in the United Kingdom was the corresponding figure lower, the EU average amounted to 48 per cent (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Eurobarometer</i> 61</a></span>: 8). As elsewhere, the EP elections were treated as secondary to national campaigns by parties, media and voters.
            </p>
            
            <p>The four established Austrian parties represented in the national parliament and the EP relied on well‐known faces at the top of their candidate lists. The ÖVP once more put up Ursula Stenzel, who had already presided over the party list in 1996 and 1999. The SPÖ, by contrast, did not re‐nominate Hans‐Peter Martin, a former journalist and author, who had been put forward in 1999 as an independent candidate. Instead, the SPÖ team was led by Hannes Swoboda, a widely respected MEP, who had already been top candidate in 1996 and chairman of the SPÖ faction since then. The candidate list of the right‐wing, populist FPÖ mirrored the intra‐party splits that had developed since the party entered the coalition government with the ÖVP in 2000; in accordance with the pragmatic course of the parliamentary‐governmental wing, Hans Kronberger, MEP since 1996 and expert in environmental policy, was selected to run as top candidate. On the third place of the list, however, was placed Andreas Mölzer, a representative of the traditional German‐national wing of the party, who despised the party's new strategy of vote‐maximization. The Greens fought their campaign under the leadership of their experienced MEP Johannes Voggenhuber.</p>
            
            <p>The established parties were challenged by two new competitors. The ousted SPÖ top candidate founded his own list, named ‘List Hans‐Peter Martin’ (HPM), which saw its major targets in the undemocratic character of the EU institutions and the privileges of the MEPs. Finally, a list called ‘Left’ ran for the elections, with Leo Gabriel, president of a research institute focusing on Latin America and co‐founder of Attac Austria, as top candidate. The ‘Left’ was supported by the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ), whose chairman occupied the third place on its candidate list.</p>
            
            <p>The ÖVP campaigned for securing economic growth, strengthening the rights of the EP, and a modern and citizen‐oriented constitution. The coalition partner FPÖ sent diverse signals to the voters: top candidate Kronberger praised the importance of the peace project of the EU, even though he was of the opinion that the recent enlargement by including ten East and Southern European countries should be the last one for some time to come; his rival Mölzer was less moderate and wanted to close the Austrian borders against immigrants altogether. The SPÖ stressed the opportunity for the voters to pass judgement on the incumbent government in the EP elections. The major slogan was ‘Austria must be heard again’, alluding to the problems that the new ÖVP‐FPÖ government encountered after its inauguration in 2000 to be accepted as an equal partner by the other EU governments. In addition, the SPÖ fought against rising unemployment rates and the erosion of the ‘European social model’. The Greens demanded a transformation of the EU from a project of governments ruling like feudal lords to one of the European citizens, an extension of the co‐decision rights of the EP, and a reinforcement of the common social and environmental policy. Austria's traditional neutrality policy, they claimed, was to be upheld within an autonomous EU common foreign and security policy. The list HPM focused its campaign on attacking the system of MEP salaries and travel expenses, which according to Martin was prone to abuse. When the social democratic fraction in the EP (PES) excluded him because of his ‘inquisitorial’ methods (Martin had collected his evidence by using a hidden camera and tape recorder, and several MEPs had been intimidated by him), he depicted himself as a martyr and declared his determination to continue his fight. Soon the most widely read daily tabloid, the <i>Kronen Zeitung</i>, started to support him. The ‘Left’ opposed the neo‐liberal and ‘racist’ policies of the EU and the provisions for military re‐armament in the draft for the new constitution.
            </p>
            
            <p>However, the primary concerns of the election programmes were superseded by other issues. Newspaper columnists, political scientists and even politicians (Franz Fischler, the Austrian member of the EU Commission, being the most prominent) deplored time and again the low level of debate and the widespread opinion, fostered by all parties, that all evil had its origin in Brussels. In the beginning, media coverage was dominated by party rebel Martin and centred on MEP salaries and travel expenses. All parties agreed with Martin that the respective EU regulations had to be amended, but at the same time objected to his ‘<i>Stasi</i> methods’. The second prominent issue related to the question of whether – and if so, when – Turkey should be allowed to join the EU. All parties, except the ‘Left’, agreed that Turkey was not yet fit for membership, and that the EU should first come to terms with its recent enlargement from 15 to 25 states. The reasons given differed, however: while the FPÖ pointed to Turkey's ‘non‐European’, Islamic, character, the other parties were more concerned about the country's economic and social fitness, its human rights standards and its treatment of the Kurdish minority. Chancellor Schüssel's plea that to transform the Austrian elections to the EP into a referendum on Turkey's EU membership was missing the point was ignored.
            </p>
            
            <p>The FPÖ, notably former party chairman Jörg Haider, was the author of a third issue: Haider dug up a letter of the SPÖ's candidate Swoboda to his colleagues in the EP, in which Swoboda showed support of the ‘direction and philosophy’ of the ‘sanctions’ of the other 14 EU governments against the new ÖVP‐FPÖ government in 2000. Haider called Swoboda a ‘traitor to one's country’ and demanded that he be deprived of his voting rights. The charges were soon extended to the SPÖ as a whole, which backed up Swoboda. The ÖVP criticised Swoboda as well, although it disapproved of the FPÖ plan to install a parliamentary committee to investigate the case. Nevertheless, the SPÖ thereafter tried to transform the EP elections into a referendum on political style, an opportunity to pass judgement on the ‘mud struggle’ performed by the governing parties. The conflict escalated when an SPÖ member of Parliament, furious about the ‘patriotic’ affectation of the governing parties, said ÖVP and FPÖ were ‘at liberty to mourn for the National Socialists’, and when SPÖ chairman Alfred Gusenbauer defended him by alluding to the ‘pogrom atmosphere’ in the respective parliamentary meeting. As a consequence, the last week before election day was filled with reproaches and counter‐reproaches that the ‘other side’ should apologise for violations of basic standards of political decency.</p>
            
            <p>It was no wonder that, as a result of widespread anti‐EU feelings and the campaign issues and style, voter turnout dropped to 42.4 per cent, the lowest in any national election since 1945 (by comparison, 84.3 per cent of the electorate went to the polls in the 2002 elections for the lower house of Parliament, and 71.6 per cent in the elections for the Federal President two months earlier). The SPÖ (33.3 per cent) remained the strongest party, slightly in front of the ÖVP (32.7 per cent); both major parties gained votes. The ÖVP was one of the few governing parties in Europe that did not lose votes. However, because of the reduction of seats for Austria in the new EP (18 instead of 21), it had to give up one seat. For the first time, the Greens crossed the threshold of 10 per cent in a national election and became the second strongest party in the capital, Vienna.</p>
            
            <p>The FPÖ suffered the next disaster: similar to the general elections of 2002, when the party declined from 26.9 to 10 per cent, the party lost 17.1 per cent of the votes (the biggest loss any party had experienced in any national or provincial election since 1945) and was only able to defend one of its five seats in the EP. Like the general elections two years before, the EP elections demonstrated that the FPÖ, a part of the political establishment since its participation in the federal government, had lost its grip on the protest voters. According to opinion polls, 60 per cent of the FPÖ voters of 1999 did not vote at all this time, 15 per cent switched over to Martin, and only 16 per cent remained loyal to the FPÖ (<span title=""><a href="#b10" id="#b10R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">SORA 2004</a></span>). Intra‐party critics blamed the cooperative politics of the party leadership in the coalition with the ÖVP and the neglect of its former anti‐EU stance as the main reasons for the electoral defeat. Mölzer's campaign proved successful: with 21,980 preference votes, he pushed Kronberger (with only 8,965 preference votes) from the first place of the FPÖ list. The FPÖ is now represented in the EP by a clear adherent of the former German‐national core group of the party, reviving a tradition that had seemed to belong to the past.
            </p>
            
            <p>Hans‐Peter Martin attracted voters from all other parties: 15 per cent came from 1999 FPÖ voters, 9 per cent from the SPÖ, 6 per cent from the ÖVP and 8 per cent from the Greens (<span title=""><a href="#b10" id="#b10R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">SORA 2004</a></span>). The support by the <i>Kronen Zeitung</i> also had an effect: 21 per cent of its readers voted for Martin, and 77 per cent of all Martin voters were readers of the newspaper (<span title=""><a href="#b9" id="#b9R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Plasser &amp; Ulram 2004b</a></span>: 18, 22). Though previously treated as only of secondary importance, the EP elections, in particular with regard to the trends in the protest voter segment, turned out to have major consequences (see <a href="#ss4" class="scrollableLink"><b>Cabinet report</b></a> below).
            </p>
            
         </section></section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Cabinet report</h2>
         
         <p>The results of the EP elections (see <a href="#ss3" class="scrollableLink"><b>Elections to the European Parliament</b></a> above) prompted a severe crisis within the FPÖ and threw a shadow on the long‐term prospects of the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition. The FPÖ's nationalist wing, strengthened by the triumph of Andreas Mölzer, called for a new start. The party leadership announced a re‐building of its government team. However, of the three FPÖ portfolios, two could not be changed: Vice Chancellor Hubert Gorbach was out of the question, and party chairman and Minister for Social Affairs Herbert Haupt, in spite of his unfavourable public image, refused to resign. As a consequence, Minister of Justice Dieter Böhmdorfer (who could not be blamed in any meaningful way for the electoral defeat) offered to step down. As former party chairman and Carinthian Governor, Jörg Haider was not eager to take over party chairmanship; his sister Ursula Haubner, state secretary for women since February 2003 and managing party chairman since October 2003, was designated by the party executive to replace Herbert Haupt as party chairman (not as Minister for Social Affairs, though). At an extraordinary party congress, she was elected by 79 per cent of the votes. She had to accept, however, that two declared supporters of Mölzer were assigned important positions: the chairman of the Viennese party organisation was elected deputy chairman, and the former chairman of the parliamentary party group (known in the media as the FPÖ's ‘doberman’) was assigned the presidency of the party academy.
         </p>
         
         <p>Böhmdorfer, the eighth FPÖ minister since 2000 to leave government prematurely, was replaced as Minister of Justice by Karin Miklautsch. Since 1991 a civil servant in the Carinthian provincial government, responsible for environmental law and lately director of the bureau for water law, she was unknown to the public. Suggested by Haider, her nomination came as a considerable surprise even to the chairmen of the provincial party organisations, who were not included in the decision‐making process. At the same time, minor revisions were made in the distribution of the FPÖ‐held state secretariats: the secretariat in the Ministry for Health and Women was abolished; instead the position of a state secretary (responsible for research) was established in the Infrastructure Ministry of Vice‐Chancellor Gorbach to relieve the minister (it was the second secretariat in the ministry, after the one responsible for traffic).</p>
         
         <p>In October, the next change in the ministerial team of Chancellor Schüssel took place. Ursula Plassnik took the position of Benita Ferrero‐Waldner, who moved to Brussels to become Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy. Plassnik had made a career in diplomacy (several Austrian embassies, OSCE, EFTA) after 1981 and had been director of Vice‐Chancellor and Chancellor Schüssel's personal staff since 1997 and 2000, respectively. Cabinet reshuffles since 2000 had usually encountered strong criticism by the opposition parties; Plassnik, however, received a friendly welcome.</p>
         
         <p>While the change in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was foreseeable and planned, the next one obviously surprised the ÖVP and even Chancellor Schüssel, a man of precise planning, who had constantly asserted that his party, contrary to the FPÖ, was a guarantee for political stability. The Minister for the Interior, Ernst Strasser (ÖVP), resigned. He entered government in 2000 as a respected liberal, but by and by had to execute restrictive immigration and integration policies (for which he had come under permanent fire by opposition parties and non‐governmental organisations). Only lately had the Constitutional Court revoked the new asylum law (see <a href="#ss6" class="scrollableLink"><b>Issues in national politics</b></a> below). On the other hand, the timing of his resignation could also be justified by the fact that the minister had just finished his major reform project, the fusion of the two security forces.
         </p>
         
         <p>Although Strasser had offered to remain in office until the Chancellor found a successor, Schüssel decided immediately that the Minister for Defence, Günther Platter (ÖVP) should also lead the Ministry of the Interior, although only temporarily. The opposition parties condemned the concentration of the power over police and army in one set of hands, which they considered inappropriate for a civilised, democratic state. Wishes of the coalition partner FPÖ to take over the ministry were dismissed by the ÖVP at once. Like Strasser, his successor came from the province of Lower Austria, whose Governor is one of the strong leaders in the ÖVP. Liese Prokop, a famous athlete in her youth, entered the provincial parliament of Lower Austria in 1969; in 1981 she ascended into the provincial government, responsible for social policy, families and culture.</p>
         
         <p>No further changes in the cabinet occurred in 2004, although the opposition parties continued their attacks on Finance Minister Karl‐Heinz Grasser concerning his financial assistance by the association of Austrian industrialists. No motion of censure, however, received the necessary parliamentary majority. After the public prosecutor (subordinate to the Minister of Justice) and the tax authorities (subordinate to the Minister of Finance) decided to stop their investigations, the ‘Grasser affair’ cooled down.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>The so‐called ‘Austria Convention’, comprised of politicians of various parties, representatives of the provinces, and of social partners and constitutional experts, had been discussing since mid‐2003 a reform of the Austrian constitution, which dates back to 1920. Its mandate was to create a more efficient constitution with a new catalogue of civil rights. Soon it turned out that the goal of reaching an agreement before the end of 2004 was too ambitious. The claims of the opposition parties to expand the parliamentary control instruments and to introduce (in addition to liberal civil rights) individually enforceable social rights were rejected by the governing parties. Likewise, the distribution of responsibilities between federal and provincial governments was controversial. The chances for political consensus eroded further when the SPÖ stipulated that it would agree to the new document only on the condition that the government draw back recent reforms, among others the new structure of the central social insurance institution and the modified electoral system for the students’ interest organisation (see <a href="#ss6" class="scrollableLink"><b>Issues in national politics</b></a> below). Up to the end of 2004, agreement could only be reached on minor issues, while the major issues could not be resolved.
         </p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss6"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss6-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The ÖVP‐FPÖ government continued its project to ‘govern Austria anew’ (this was the title of its coalition programme in 2000). In 2004, the amount of tax‐free income was increased and taxes for families with children were lowered. The tariffs for capital corporations were also reduced (from 34 to 25 per cent). According to the audit office and the centre for statistics, however, the proclaimed overall tax reduction ‘for every Austrian’ was, in particular for people of low and of very high income, more than eaten up by higher energy taxes and increases in pension insurance contributions. The government, via the Austrian holding company of state assets in industry (ÖIAG), privatised all its shares in the steel corporation VA Tech, which were bought by Siemens. A law re‐organised the health sector, establishing a federal health agency and nine provincial health funds. The central social insurance institution, whose re‐organisation in 2001 had been annulled by the Constitutional Court in 2003 because of violations of the principle of self‐administration, received a new structure. The social insurance institutions are now represented in the executive board; however, the opposition parties were still dissatisfied with the equal representation of employers and employees. Reproaches of ‘re‐colouring’ attempts were also addressed to the governing parties when they decided to change the electoral system of the national body of the students’ interest organisation from direct election to indirect delegation (by the provincial bodies).</p>
         
         <p>In 2004, as in the years before, the Constitutional Court abrogated further reforms of the government, partly based upon appeals by the opposition parties. The new regulations of the general social insurance law of 2002, obliging profitable health insurance companies to grant credits to companies with deficits, were declared unconstitutional. The court also annulled a law of 2001 that allowed the government to force civil servants into early retirement to enable major structural reforms (the opposition parties had always suspected the government of having patronage as its real motivation). Moreover, the outsourcing of the alternative civilian service from the Ministry of the Interior to the Red Cross was abolished. At the same time, major provisions of the new asylum law, in particular the barring of asylum seekers from bringing forward new arguments during the appeals procedures and the possibility of their expulsion before the end of the proceedings, were repealed. Constitutional lawyers attributed the decreasing quality of many laws to the high speed of reform, which had resulted in growing disrespect of the Constitution.</p>
         
         <p>Once again, the reform of the pension system dominated public debate throughout the year. When it turned out that the last reform of the system in 2003, which contained increases in the health insurance contributions of retired persons, resulted in overall pension reductions for over one million people (i.e., more than half of all retired persons), the ÖVP‐FPÖ government got into trouble. To reduce the blame, the two parties decided on a one‐time increase for the lowest pensions of 0.6 per cent. In spite of this, a people's initiative (<i>Volksbegehren</i>) was started by the SPÖ to demand fair and secure pensions for all; it was signed by 627,559 people (i.e., 10.5 per cent of the electorate), making it the tenth most successful initiative of the 31 since 1964 (a failure according to the governing parties). Harmonisation between the pension systems of the different employee groups, in particular the incorporation of the system of the civil servants, was delayed several times. After 22 rounds, the government broke up its negotiations with the major interest groups (‘social partners’) without results. Thereupon, the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition presented its own proposal for harmonisation, including all people under the age of 50; the contributions of self‐employed people and farmers were slightly increased (to 17.5 and 15 per cent of their income, respectively), though still lying below the percentage of white‐ and blue‐collar workers (22.8 per cent); people willing to retire before the regular retirement age (65 for men after 2014, the same for women after 2033) had to face a cut of their pension by 4.2 per cent per year; after 45 years of contributions, the pension would amount to 80 per cent of the average lifetime income. Pressure by the employees’ organisation of the ÖVP and the FPÖ resulted in a special provision that people who have 45 insurance years and have ‘worked heavily’ for at least 15 years should be able to retire prematurely with a pension cut of at most 2.1 per cent per year. On the other hand, the FPÖ did not succeed with its demand that pension cuts should be limited to 15 per cent at most. The opposition parties as well as the two interest organisations of the employees (trade unions, Chamber of Labour) criticised the government reform, which according to them would lead to drastic pension cuts of up to 20 per cent in individual cases, in particular affected women and once more omitted civil servants, a major ÖVP clientele.

         <p>Immigration and asylum policy also caused grave political conflicts. The federal government and the nine provincial governments had finally reached an agreement concerning the distribution of asylum seekers to be catered for by the state authorities. Some of the provinces failed to fulfil their quotas, however; they blamed the Ministry of the Interior for having supplied them with false data concerning the expected numbers of asylum seekers (instead of 16,000, 26,000 appeared). Thereupon, the province of Carinthia cancelled the agreement, while the Minister of the Interior ordered that the major, and overcrowded, Austrian refugee camp should release 50 refugees per day. The opposition parties as well as nongovernmental organisations criticised the inhuman political games played with the fates of traumatised refugees.</p>
         
         <p>In the context of immigration policy, another question was discussed: the pending EU accession of Turkey. The debate on the issue, which had already raised emotions in the course of the EP elections, continued throughout the year. Negotiations with Turkey were seen by supporters as an instrument to secure political reforms in the country. Still, because of the sensitivity of the matter (the great majority of people rejected EU entry for Turkey), all four parliamentary parties had trouble defining their positions. Only the Greens advocated negotiations with the goal of accession, the ÖVP preferred negotiations with an open end, while the SPÖ wanted to exclude the option of full accession from negotiations; the FPÖ was against negotiations at all. In addition, all parties were internally split. Another conflict related to the question of whether the power of the national Parliament to bind the government in EU legislative matters also referred to a decision of the EU council to open accession negotiations: the ÖVP repudiated such an interpretation, SPÖ and Greens (together with prominent constitutional lawyers) supported it. When the EU council decided on the matter, Chancellor Schüssel's proposal not to restrict the goal of the negotiations to full accession, but to consider another form of partnership as well was not accepted by his colleagues (instead, the council announced the start of negotiations with Turkey in October 2005). In order to satisfy the Austrian public, the ÖVP and FPÖ passed a resolution in Parliament that the final decision concerning whether Turkey should be accepted as an EU member was to be made in a referendum; only the Greens opposed this step.</p>
         
         <p>In June, a new president was elected for the audit office (<i>Rechnungshof</i>), the central institution controlling the federal budget. After twelve years in office, the incumbent president, Franz Fiedler, had to give up his position. Once again, the opposition failed to install a candidate for this important control function. While Fiedler had been described as ÖVP‐near at the time of his election in 1992 (but had criticised government actions on many occasions since), the new president had been director of the FPÖ group in the national Parliament before he moved into the management of the national railway corporation (ÖBB). He was elected by the lower House of Parliament by 94 (ÖVP and FPÖ) against 83 (SPÖ and Green) votes.
         </p>
         
         <p>The elections for the Chamber of Labour (<i>Arbeiterkammer</i>) between February and May represented a special test for the popularity of the social policy of the federal ÖVP‐FPÖ government, which had time and again been denounced by the Chamber (as well as by the trade unions and the opposition parties) as manifesting ‘social coldness’. The results confirmed this accusation to some extent: the Social Democratic list increased its share of the votes by 5.9 per cent (to 63.4 per cent), while the ÖVP list lost 2.5 per cent (now 22.7 per cent) and the FPÖ list 4.8 per cent (now 4.9 per cent). Alternative and green trade unionists rose from 3.7 to 4.4 per cent.
         </p>
         
         <p>As in the year before, elections for the provincial parliament (<i>Landtag</i>) were held in three provinces in 2004. The federal ÖVP‐FPÖ government did not facilitate the task of its provincial party organisations with its pension reform. The Governors of Carinthia and Salzburg felt prompted to announce that retired persons with minimum pensions would receive compensation for their losses out of the provincial budgets. Provincial ÖVP and FPÖ politicians time and again deplored the overhasty reform speed and the lack of sensitivity for the needs of ordinary people.
         </p>
         
         <p>From a national point of view, the elections in Carinthia on 7 March were the most important ones. In 1999, the FPÖ, for the first time since 1945, obtained the front position in a province. Observers were curious whether Jörg Haider, the former party chairman of the FPÖ, would be able to defend his position as Governor and reverse the general downward trend of the FPÖ, visible in all <i>Landtag</i> elections since the beginning of government participation in 2000. Spending huge sums for the campaign, the FPÖ achieved its goal and maintained its first place with 42.4 per cent of the votes (+0.4 per cent). The SPÖ, which had for a long time looked like the clear winner, increased its share by 6.5 per cent (to 38.4 per cent), but failed to reach the top position. Haider, who abstained from extreme verbal injuries this time, clearly won the popularity test against the technocratic SPÖ top candidate, whose position was also contested within his own party. The greatest loser of the election, however, was the ÖVP, which ended up with only 11.6 per cent of the vote (−9.1 per cent), the worst result for an ÖVP regional party organisation since 1945. Because of Haider's visits to the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and other misbehaviour, the ÖVP (against the recommendations of federal party leaders) announced that it would refuse to enable the re‐election of Haider as Governor, even should his party win a majority. Many voters, and even 63 per cent of the ÖVP supporters, objected to this position (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Filzmaier &amp; Hajek 2005</a></span>: 26).
         </p>
         
         <p>The Greens, who gained 6.7 per cent (+2.8 per cent) of the votes, for the first time won seats in the <i>Landtag</i>; since the Carinthian election, they are represented in all provincial parliaments. After the election, Haider struck his next coup: because of the constitutional provision that all parties have a right to be represented in government according to their electoral strength, the new government was built of three FPÖ members, three SPÖ members and one ÖVP member. As the SPÖ feared being overruled by an FPÖ‐ÖVP coalition, the SPÖ leadership (against the will of many party members and of the national headquarters) signed a coalition treaty with the FPÖ in short order, putting an end to the official SPÖ policy of excluding Haider because of his lack of ‘governing fitness’. In spite of this, Haider was re‐elected as Governor with the votes of the MPs of the FPÖ and ÖVP only, while the majority of the SPÖ MPs left parliament at the time of election. If he had ever ceased to play that role, Haider emerged as the FPÖ's strongman and a political figure of national relevance again.
         </p>
         
         <p>The <i>Landtag</i> elections in Salzburg, held on the same day, resulted in the next shock for the ÖVP. Since 1945 the province had been dominated by the ÖVP, which had set up all provincial governors so far. The incumbent ÖVP Governor, however, made a big tactical mistake when he announced that, should his party win the election, he would step down in the middle of the legislative period and pass over his office to the son of a former, well‐known Governor. As the politician's son had no political experience, the Governor achieved nothing but damage to his own image. The additional strategy of the ÖVP to warn, pointing at Germany, of the ‘red‐green ghost’ did not work out. The SPÖ, whose top candidate according to opinion polls was more popular than the incumbent Governor, grasped the opportunity and was able to increase the party's share of the votes by 13.1 per cent (to 45.4 per cent), the largest increase of any party in provincial elections after 1945. The ÖVP stagnated at 37.9 per cent (0.8 per cent less than in 1999). The FPÖ lost 10.9 per cent; with 8.7 per cent it ended up with its worst result in Salzburg since 1949. The <i>Landtag</i> was completed by the Greens, who gained 2.6 per cent and now have 8.0 per cent of the vote. Although a coalition with the Greens would have had a parliamentary majority, the SPÖ decided to renew its coalition with the ÖVP, arguing that the biggest problem of the province, rising unemployment, can only be solved through the cooperation of the major parties, all the more so as the great majority of the mayors in Salzburg were from the ÖVP.
         </p>
         
         <p>The third provincial election took place in Vorarlberg on 19 September. With 54.9 per cent of the vote, the ÖVP was able to regain the absolute majority it had lost in the election of 1999 (then 45.8 per cent). Success was primarily due to the strategy of renouncing any support by federal ÖVP politicians and to the general trust of the people in the incumbent Governor (with 61 per cent, he had the highest popularity of all Governors at that time) (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Filzmaier &amp; Hajek 2005</a></span>: 28). It has to be mentioned, however, that in absolute terms, the ÖVP lost votes; its victory was only made possible by a dramatic decline in voter turnout from 87.8 to 60.6 per cent. The FPÖ (formerly 27.4 per cent), following the electoral trend since 2000, secured 12.9 per cent of the vote this time, which cost it second place (the ÖVP, despite its absolute majority, invited the FPÖ to stay in government, however). The SPÖ, traditionally weak in the province, rose from 13.0 to 16.9 per cent, and the Greens from 6.0 to 10.2 per cent.
         </p>
         
         <p>Therefore, the general trend of provincial elections in 2004 was, contrary to 2003, that voters turning away from the FPÖ did not move to the ÖVP, but to the SPÖ and into the camp of non‐voters. The electoral basis of the ÖVP‐FPÖ government seemed to erode.</p>
