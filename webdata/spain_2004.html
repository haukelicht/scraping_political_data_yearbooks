         <p>There were two incidents in particular that dominated national politics in Spain in 2004. The first had to do with the legislative elections, while the second was the terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March. Many political commentators described the 2004 election as a political earthquake. They were referring in particular to the disastrous results for the Popular Party. Formerly having an absolute majority in Parliament, it became the main party in opposition. The development of the economy was, in most respects, uniquely favourable to the party in government. Economic growth and rising standards of living continued at the beginning of the year. By the time of the election in March, given the rather prosperous state of the Spanish economy, criticism of the government tended to be much more concerned with foreign policy. For the first time in Spain, the Iraq war issue became an important item during the campaign, reflecting increasing scepticism among groups of voters, including government party supporters.</p>
         
         <p>Before leaving office, Aznar nominated Mariano Rajoy as the candidate for the Popular Party. This was the first time the President, who calls elections, did not compete for re‐election. The candidate of the main opposition party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, was also a new candidate, competing for the first time in the election as the new leader of the PSOE. At the end of the political campaign for the legislative elections, the entire political environment changed abruptly. The worst terrorist attack ever experienced in Spain took place in Madrid three days before the elections, killing nearly 200 and injuring a thousand more. This situation, without precedent in the democratic world, introduced post‐electoral debates over the impact of the terrorist attack on the elections. The Popular Party had a comfortable advantage in the opinion polls, but lost the election on 14 March. In addition, the electoral campaign was cancelled just after the terrorist attack following a joint decision by the candidates of the two main parties. The day after the attack, the government called for demonstrations by all institutions and citizens to stand against terrorism. They took place in all the main cities and villages. At their end and during the ‘reflection day’, the government was accused by the opposition of lying about who the terrorists were, unfairly using the mass media, and encouraging illegal demonstrations and press conferences.</p>
         
         <p>In this context, voter turnout for the elections was significantly higher than in the previous elections in 2000. The Socialist Party was returned to power after two terms of the Popular Party under Prime Minister Aznar. The largest parliamentary party, the Socialists, reached legislature agreements with all the parliamentary parties except the Popular Party. Their legislative support for the term was not public, although it can be said that the main support was given by the two parties that share government with the PSOE in the regional government of Cataluña: the ERC (a republican and nationalist radical left‐wing party) and IU (a coalition of the Spanish Communist Party, greens and other leftist groups). When no party has an absolute majority, the ‘tradition’ of Spanish governments has been one of parliamentary support, as opposed to coalitions, perhaps due to the weight of prime ministerial power.</p>
         
         <p>The new Socialist Party government of Prime Minister J.L. Rodríguez Zapatero quickly kept their campaign pledge to withdraw the Spanish troop contingent from Iraq. This was the very first decision taken by the new Prime Minister and signalled the new government's foreign policy, which changed that of most of the former government. During 2004, the new government introduced many other changes in almost all policy areas, except the main aspects of economic policy. It also set about improving relations with neighbouring Morocco, after two years of tension under the previous government.</p>
         
         <p>So far, only one person has been convicted of involvement in the Madrid attacks. Most of the more than 70 people arrested in the course of the investigation, and most of the suspects who have been provisionally charged, are Moroccans, but they have also included others from Spain, Algeria and Lebanon. A further seven suspects died in an apparent suicide explosion in the Madrid suburb of Leganes on 3 April.</p>

            <p>For the third time, the Socialist president of the regional government of Andalucia called regional elections on the same day as the legislative ones. In contrast to the two previous elections, in which the candidate M. Chaves won with a relative majority and two coalition governments with a regional party (<i>Partido Andalucista</i>) were established, those held on 14 March 2004 were won by the Socialist Party with an absolute majority. This result shows that the electoral behaviour in both types of elections is quite similar and does not present a dual vote. The turnout reached 76 per cent, similar to the turnouts in national and regional elections held in 1996 that produced high competition. The turnout increased by 6 per cent compared to 2000, a similar percentage to the Socialist increase and the Popular Party decrease. The remainder of the party composition is quite similar to the previous one.

            <p>Once again, an election for the European Parliament (EP) mostly provided an opportunity for a purely domestic contest. This stemmed from its place in the Spanish electoral calendar. Coming after the general elections, the European election was not only a test of the balance of political forces, but a new opportunity to test their mobilisation as well. No specifically European issue dominated the campaign. Most of the campaign focused on candidates and their views on the European Union (EU) and its enlargement policy, and the ratification of the European Treaty announced by the Prime Minister as a popular referendum.</p>
            
            <p>In a political landscape shaken by the fight against terrorism and the change that occurred at the national political level, the results of the European elections can be analysed in different ways. First, one can emphasise the relative success of the Socialist Party compared to the defeat of the Popular Party. The share of the vote of the two main parliamentary parties were quite similar, with a difference of 2.21 per cent of the total votes cast in favour of the Socialist Party and only one seat more than the number obtained by the Popular Party. Second, one can point out the change experienced by the Socialist Party. Compared to the previous European elections, PSOE has obtained an 8.3 per cent increase in votes. This result confirmed that obtained in the legislative election held two months before. This success appeared to be linked with the national mood, still in shock over the terrorist attack. This is not to say that Europe, its institutions, parliament and powers, mobilised the electorate. Turnout decreased from 64.3 per cent in 1999 to 45.1 per cent in 2004. This low rate of participation was linked less to opposition to the EU than to the Spanish electoral agenda.</p>
