         <p>In September 2002, the coalition between the Christian Democratic Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the right‐wing, populist Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), built in February 2000 against massive national as well as international resistance (see the Austria entry in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2000</i>), collapsed before the legislative period came to its regular end. This development was interpreted by many as proof that the Freedom Party was definitely not fit to govern (<i>regierungsfähig</i>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Government work began to get increasingly difficult from the beginning of 2002, above all because one of the major architects of the centre‐right coalition and ‘hidden’ party leader of the FPÖ, Jörg Haider, repeatedly broke his promises to concentrate on his job as provincial governor of the southern province of Carinthia and to keep out of national politics. Although he had passed the party chairmanship formally to Vice‐Chancellor Susanne Riess‐Passer (his long‐term press secretary, who owed her party career entirely to his support) in May 2000, he never truly relinquished the top position and remained the most popular politician with the party's rank‐and‐file. Not being a cabinet member himself, he retained a free hand to criticise government work, thereby challenging decisions taken by the FPÖ ministers in the cabinet.</p>
         
         <p>In spring 2002, the government faced mounting problems in getting across its reforms (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below). Instead, negative headlines about the FPÖ dominated the news. Once again, an FPÖ cabinet member, the Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology, Monika Forstinger, who had built up a public image of not being up to the responsibilities of her ministry, had to be replaced after a rather short term (15 months) in February. She was succeeded by Mathias Reichhold, who had made his political career under Haider's auspices (general secretary of the FPÖ, member of the national Parliament, the provincial government in Carinthia and the European Parliament). In 2000, he left politics for his farm, but Haider was able to reactivate him. In the same month, Haider visited Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, without informing the Minister for Foreign Affairs from the ÖVP. His journey prompted criticisms not only from the opposition parties, but also from the coalition partner. When the leader of the parliamentary party group, Peter Westenthaler, appealed to Haider to let the government work and demanded that the FPÖ should eventually decide whether it wanted to stay an opposition or become a governing party, the intra‐party split became obvious. Haider felt insulted and retreated from his position in the coalition committee.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>In May, the FPÖ‐nominated ombudsman Ewald Stadler equated the period of occupation by the Allied Powers in the decade after 1945 with the Nazi era. He was called upon to resign by all sides, but refused to do so (and could not be removed), saying that he did not intend to bow down before the ‘left‐wing opinion dictatorship’ prevailing in Austria. Another scandal concerned the nomination of the FPÖ speaker for social affairs, Reinhart Gaugg, for the job of vice‐general director of the national pension insurance company. He did not have the usual qualifications for the job, demanded an extraordinarily high salary and refused to give up his seat in Parliament. The opposition parties and the media did not tire of stressing that the case stood in striking contrast to the anti‐privilege image of the FPÖ. The problem was solved when Gaugg was caught driving under the influence of alcohol and had to resign. Finally, in July, Haider met with top leaders of far‐right West European parties (Vlaams Blok and Lega Nord) to intensify transnational cooperation. Party chairwoman and Vice‐Chancellor Riess‐Passer dismissed such advances; she repudiated in particular positions of ‘ethnic purity’ taken by the Vlaams Blok.</p>
         
         <p>In summer 2002, the basic incompatibility between the FPÖ's heritage as a populist, anti‐establishment party and its new governing responsibilities came to the fore more intensely than ever before and finally terminated the government's tenure. In July, FPÖ cabinet members and the party leadership agreed to a government decision postponing for one year a tax reform, which according to the coalition agreement should have come into effect in 2003 (i.e., before the next general election), because of bleak economic prospects and unexpected government expenditures (about 11.06 billion) to repair the damages caused by the summer floods.</p>
         
         <p>Haider's allies collected signatures from a majority of the delegates to the party congress in order to assemble an extraordinary party congress. The delegates met in early September in a small town in the province of Styria called Knittelfeld (soon to become synonymous in the media and political debate with radical right‐wing populism within the FPÖ). In the informal Knittelfeld meeting, Finance Minister Karl‐Heinz Grasser (the most popular Austrian politician according to opinion polls) was harshly affronted. A compromise paper set up by party chairwoman and Vice‐Chancellor Riess‐Passer, which called off the tax reform for 2003 and contained a commitment to European Union enlargement, was torn apart by a delegate to great applause. The meeting provoked the immediate resignation of Riess‐Passer, Grasser and Westenthaler, who were joined by Infrastructure Minister Mathias Reichhold the next day. Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel (ÖVP) dissolved the coalition with the FPÖ one day after the Knittelfeld meeting, and premature elections for parliament were held in November 2002.</p>
         
         <p>The Knittelfeld rebels, backed by former party chairman Haider, argued that the FPÖ cabinet members and the new party leadership had broken their major electoral promise and undermined the credibility of the party, which in the past had always fought for the interests of the ‘small man’. Two and a half years in government had damaged the image and credibility of the party. It had ridden high on Haider's aggressive anti‐establishment rhetoric, which was successful while outside the Vienna halls of power. As soon as the FPÖ (or at least members of its pragmatic wing) had entered government, it became part of the establishment, had to accept compromises with its coalition partner and was made responsible for unpopular government policies. Sub‐national electoral results and polls indicated that the FPÖ as a government party had lost its grip on the protest voters, who, contrary to the belief of the FPÖ's cabinet team, could not largely be replaced by voters attracted by the FPÖ's government record (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>). However, the deeper reason for the clash was a conflict about the leadership of the party. With regard to the tax reform, Haider had made two attempts to rally the party behind him. Both failed: neither the party executive nor the parliamentary party group accepted his proposals. Haider saw the big ‘project’ of his life in danger, and became aware that his role as the party's real leader might be slipping away. The resignation of Riess‐Passer and, in particular, Grasser removed the two FPÖ politicians who were considerably more popular among the general electorate than Haider (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Soon, however, Haider lost control of the process he had started. The upcoming elections in 2003 in the provinces of Lower and Upper Austria intensified the intra‐party conflict. Both FPÖ party organisations took a particularly uncompromising stance against their own government team, advocating a return to a more promising strategy in electoral terms. Haider had also hoped to continue the coalition with a renewed FPÖ team. Yet, Chancellor Schüssel did not like the prospect of a coalition partner returning to its populist opposition style, with another set of inexperienced FPÖ ministers kept on short leash by Haider. He also saw a good chance to win over former FPÖ voters who preferred a continuation of the market‐oriented reforms to populist slogans. Finally, Schüssel wanted to preserve the credit he had earned for his performance as Chancellor by ending the coalition with dignity. Going through an election now looked much more promising than waiting until the end of the term and seeing the ÖVP‐FPÖ majority fading away (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The result of the 24 November 2002 elections (see <b>General elections</b> below) gave the ÖVP the central position in the coalition negotiations: it could form a majority government with any of the three other parliamentary parties. However, the SPÖ had committed itself to opposition in case it lost its front position, and the Greens had excluded a coalition with the ÖVP before the elections because of the ÖVP's ‘dirty’ anti‐green campaign. The ÖVP, in its turn, had never ruled out renewing its coalition with the FPÖ after the elections (it had done so only with regard to the Knittelfeld rebels). While it was clear from the outset that the policy differences between ÖVP and FPÖ would be rather minimal and that the FPÖ would be a much cheaper coalition partner than the SPÖ in terms of cabinet positions, it was widely doubted whether a new ‘black‐blue’ coalition would be stable (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The pre‐commitments of the parties during the election campaign were partly revised in the weeks thereafter. The SPÖ declared its willingness to start sounding‐out talks on the basis of full information regarding the state of the budget (a <i>Kassasturz</i> or ‘cash check’, in their terms). It was, however, rather disappointed when the ÖVP presented its version of the cash check on one side of a piece of paper. As a consequence, the SPÖ urged the ÖVP to state clearly with whom it wanted to form a coalition. Some Greens announced that they could imagine talking to the ÖVP about specific issues and projects (they were immediately pulled back by other Greens, however). Like the SPÖ, the Greens refused to take part in ‘parallel negotiations’ with the ÖVP. Nevertheless, the ÖVP declared that it was too early to make a definite commitment and also started sounding‐out talks with the FPÖ, although the party was haunted by heavy internal strife and backbiting after the elections. The FPÖ also nominated Knittelfeld rebels for the negotiating team. The former coalition partner, whose ministers were still members of the caretaker government, showed its eagerness to continue its role in government, which was seen as a good chance to consolidate the party. Party chairman designate and Social Minister Herbert Haupt was confirmed by an extraordinary party congress in December by 87.8 per cent of the delegates. Yet, intra‐party power relations remained unclear. The negotiations with the FPÖ made the fastest progress in the first month. As expected, however, no governing coalition showed up before the end of 2002.

         <p>The elections to the lower house of Parliament (<i>Nationalrat</i>) resulted in an unexpected landslide victory for the ÖVP. For the first time since 1966, the ÖVP became the strongest party in national elections, increasing its share of the vote from 26.9 to 42.3 per cent. This is the greatest gain for an Austrian party in the whole postwar period. In contrast, the FPÖ met its Waterloo and plunged from 26.9 to a mere 10.0 per cent. The parliamentary majority of the governing parties was slightly reduced, but remained intact. In spite of moderate gains (with 3.3 to 36.5 per cent), the SPÖ lost its status as the strongest party. With 2.1 per cent (up to 9.5 per cent), the Greens gained as well, but less than expected. The two opposition parties failed to reach the necessary parliamentary majority for a government change to a ‘red‐green’ coalition.
         </p>
         
         <p>The intra‐party conflicts leading to the implosion of the FPÖ and the breakdown of the government had set fundamentally new conditions for the election campaign. Traditional FPÖ sympathisers were disillusioned to a high degree and looked for a political alternative. The other parties attempted to attract the new voter potential. Media coverage of the campaign centred around coalition speculations. Already before the breakdown of the coalition, leading ÖVP representatives had stressed their desire to continue the ‘reform coalition’ with the FPÖ for a second legislative period in order to be able to finish the job of restructuring the country (the ÖVP, of course, carefully avoided mention that the ‘zero deficit’, reached at the end of 2001, was primarily the result of a tax policy that drove the tax burden to a record level, while it decreased in most other member states of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)). The collapse of the coalition was attributed to the irresponsible behaviour of the former FPÖ party chairman Haider, while the FPÖ cabinet members were described as pragmatic and competent colleagues. (The high turnover within the FPÖ cabinet personnel, particularly during the first year of the government's term, raised doubts concerning their proclaimed competence, however.) For this reason, the ÖVP did not rule out a renewal of the ‘black‐blue’ coalition after the elections. Nevertheless, the ÖVP presented itself as the more ‘reliable part’ of the government, relying on a competent ministerial team. The FPÖ was advised to clarify its intra‐party power structure and party goals; a coalition with representatives of the Knittelfeld rebels was ruled out. A new edition of the grand coalition with the SPÖ was only the second preferred choice, as it was equated with reform standstill and waste of money. A possible ‘red‐green’ coalition was associated by the ÖVP with chaos. The budget troubles that followed the return of the German ‘red‐green’ coalition in September 2002 lent credibility to these claims and provided tail‐wind for the ÖVP, which explicitly referred to the German case as a warning example in its campaign (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP campaign focussed on Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, who was portrayed as a guarantee for stability and continuity (the main poster asked ‘Who else if not him’, without question mark). Schüssel landed a decisive coup when he won over Finance Minister Grasser to join his team as an ‘independent expert’. Obviously designed at tying former FPÖ voters, this move was condemned by leading FPÖ representatives as ‘treason’. FPÖ voters seemed also to be addressed by decisions of the Minister of the Interior to pursue a tougher course in immigration policy: asylum‐seekers from specific countries were denied public assistance; fugitives without any chance for asylum were sent back to their home countries, and the contract with Caritas, the charity organisation of the Catholic Church, to consult fugitives was cancelled. At the same time, a forceful negative campaign was launched against a ‘red‐green’ majority of SPÖ and Greens. In a disinformation campaign, positions were ascribed to the Greens that did not reflect their current programme. So the Greens, who proposed the de‐criminalisation of the use of soft drugs, were portrayed as ‘marijuana tobacconists’ and were wrongly accused of planning to enforce vegetarianism (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Severe tensions between the two parties had already occurred in April 2002 in the context of a neo‐Nazi demonstration against an exhibition showing the active participation of parts of the German and Austrian army (<i>Wehrmacht</i>) in the extermination of Jews in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. The government had allowed the demonstration to take place on the <i>Heldenplatz</i> in Vienna (the place where tens of thousands of Austrians had hailed Hitler in 1938 for having brought Austria back into the <i>Reich</i>). In the course of the ensuing confrontation with an anti‐Nazi demonstration, stones were thrown and over 30 policemen hurt. The leader of the parliamentary party group of the ÖVP, Andreas Khol, declared that an ‘action group of Greens, left‐wing chaotic subjects, violent anarchists’, including a prominent Green Member of Parliament (MP), were responsible for the riots. The Greens, who countered that the accused MP had, on the contrary, tried to calm down the situation, were furious about this attempt to criminalise him and the party.
         </p>
         
         <p>The FPÖ, of course, had the worst starting position of all the parties. It dropped significantly in the polls after the Knittelfeld rebellion and the coalition breakdown. The party remained deeply split and for most of the campaign proved unable to come up with an effective campaign. It had six different leaders within less than two months, including Haider and finally Social Minister Herbert Haupt as acting party chairman and top candidate (who, however, was regarded as Haider's marionette). Haider's second visit in Baghdad a few weeks before the elections did not help very much. In order to appeal to the ‘small man’, the FPÖ demanded tax cuts for the lower income categories and promised a state‐guaranteed minimum income of 11,000 per month. Otherwise, the FPÖ campaign concentrated on the party's sceptical position towards the European Union, in general, and its enlargement, in particular. Finally, the FPÖ attacked Chancellor Schüssel for not having been a fair partner during the lifetime of the coalition and for not having upheld the partnership after the resignations of the FPÖ cabinet members (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The opposition parties (the SPÖ and the Greens) pursued one overriding common goal: to get rid of the incumbent ‘black‐blue’ government. Both attacked the ‘social coldness’ of government policies, especially the introduction of student tuition and ambulance fees for treatment in hospitals, the increase of the overall tax burden to an unprecedented record level (45.9 per cent of the GDP (gross domestic product)), the neglect of employment and education policy and the purchase of expensive interceptors (Eurofighters) for the national army. Their determination to build a common government after the elections faded with time, however. Before the calling of the elections, SPÖ party chairman Alfred Gusenbauer had already alienated the Greens with his proposal to change the electoral system for Parliament from proportional representation to majority rule. When the polls indicated that a large part of the electorate did not sympathise with a ‘red‐green’ coalition, the SPÖ began to signal that it would also be available for a renewed ‘grand coalition’ with the ÖVP (<span title=""><a href="#b10" id="#b10R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Plasser et al. 2003b</a></span>: 23ff.), although only under SPÖ leadership and preferably without Chancellor Schüssel and parliamentary leader Khol, who were identified as the two ÖVP politicians chiefly responsible for the ‘treason’ after the 1999 elections that finally threw the SPÖ out of government.
         </p>
         
         <p>Reacting to high public support for the ‘zero deficit’ policy, the SPÖ accepted the new budget orthodoxy. In March, party chairman Alfred Gusenbauer had even suggested introducing a ‘zero deficit’ clause into the Constitution. In its election campaign, the SPÖ committed itself to a balanced budget over the business cycle. This the SPÖ hoped would also help to get the party out of the ÖVP's negative campaign fire and the shadow of the German ‘red‐green’ coalition. However, the SPÖ did not show a good hand in its recruiting of three well‐known faces from outside of politics. They were all presented too early (and overshadowed by Schüssel's later presentation of Grasser). Moreover, while the first two (the former European Union representative in Bosnia‐Herzegovina and a well‐known newscaster on national television) appealed to the general electorate, the third one (the head of the Protestant Church in the province of Burgenland, candidate for the presidential election in 1998 and declared opponent of the FPÖ) was clearly the wrong signal for attracting former FPÖ voters.</p>
         
         <p>The Greens, as in previous election campaigns, hoped to benefit from the high popularity of their leader, the economics professor Alexander Van der Bellen. Their campaign focused on typical issues: environment, democracy, women, social security and the integration of immigrants. In order to attract wavering former FPÖ voters, they also promised to reduce taxes for people with low and middle incomes, and to fight against privileges and corruption. Initially, the Greens campaigned for the replacement of the incumbent government by a ‘red‐green’ coalition. This strategy was undermined by the SPÖ's strategy change, so the Greens increasingly turned their attention towards fighting the formation of another ‘grand coalition’ between ÖVP and SPÖ.</p>
         
         <p>Voter turnout increased slightly (from 80.4 per cent in 1999 to 84.3 per cent), indicating a higher degree of political interest in the electorate, which may be attributed to the polarisation of party competition since the inauguration of the ‘black‐blue’ government in February 2000. At the same time, volatility reached a post‐1945 peak, with 24 per cent of voters choosing a different party than in the previous election (<span title=""><a href="#b9" id="#b9R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Plasser et al. 2003a</a></span>: 101ff.). Obviously, although the implosion of the FPÖ finally seemed to confirm warnings by many critics of the new government and the opposition that the party lacked ‘governing fitness’, the ÖVP was not held responsible by the voters for having entered into a coalition with it. The major voter movement occurred between ÖVP and FPÖ: of the 1,247,000 FPÖ voters in 1999, 633,000 voted for the ÖVP in 2002; only 148,000 changed to the SPÖ (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hofinger et al. 2003</a></span>: 171; <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ogris et al. 2002</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>As a consequence of the heavy losses, the inroads of the FPÖ into the voter segments of blue‐collar workers and young voters (i.e., those aged under 30) in the 1999 elections (see the Austria entry in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 1999</i>) were reversed. The SPÖ re‐conquered its traditionally dominant position among the blue‐collar workers (with 41 per cent), while the ÖVP turned out to be the most popular party among young voters (with 33 per cent). Yet, the voter movement from the FPÖ to the SPÖ was too small to enable the desired government change. After all, no less than 34 per cent of the blue‐collar workers voted for the ÖVP. The main characteristic of the 2002 voter movements was volatility within the governing bloc, not between the governing and opposition parties (<span title=""><a href="#b9" id="#b9R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Plasser et al. 2003a</a></span>: 115ff., 123ff.).
         </p>
         
         <p>On the surface, the 2002 election restored the old order in Austrian politics, with two major parties (ÖVP and SPÖ) and two small parties (FPÖ and Greens). Yet, this order is built on sand. It is not sufficiently rooted in the long‐term collective and individual party loyalties that guaranteed its survival over many decades in the past. Rather it represents a temporary outcome that is inherently unstable and may change in the next election (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>At the turn of 2001/2002, the Austrian Constitutional Court, an institution usually not of particular interest for the wider public, became the object of a hot political debate. In December 2001, the Court ruled that the law regulating the setting up of bilingual (German and Slovenian) local signs in the ethnically mixed districts of the province of Carinthia violated the Constitution (i.e., Article 7 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1955), in which the rights of the Slovene and Croatian minorities in Austria are guaranteed. The law stipulated that bilingual local signs had to be put up only in districts in which at least 25 per cent of the population are Slovenes. Comparing the Austrian regulations with the standards in other countries, the Court drew the conclusion that 10 per cent would suffice. The former FPÖ party chairman Jörg Haider, since 1999 governor of Carinthia, refused to implement the ruling. He accused the Court of making a ‘political’ decision and threatened to ‘correct’ it by initiating a consultative referendum. In fact, some constitutional lawyers acknowledged that the Court might have exceeded its authority, and that parliament was actually responsible for settling the matter. However, they left no doubt that the Carinthian state authorities were obliged to implement the ruling. Social Democrats and Greens saw in Haider's attacks a serious danger for the constitutional state and called upon Chancellor Schüssel to bring the Carinthian governor to reason. Haider, on the contrary, intensified his criticisms. He accused the president of the Court of ‘disgraceful behaviour’, called the Court ‘politically corrupt’ and condemned the allegedly high salaries of the judges. As a consequence, the president of the Court initiated a dismissal procedure against himself, which according to the law on the organisation of the Constitutional Court would have the Court itself decide whether he was guilty of such ‘disgraceful behaviour.’ The dismissal procedure was turned down by the Court for lack of evidence. Chancellor Schüssel tried to win time and convened a ‘consensus conference’.</p>
         
         <p>The conflict also triggered a discussion about the objectivity of the selection of the members of the Constitutional Court, who are formally nominated by the government (six members plus the president and vice‐president), and by the first and second chambers of Parliament (three members each), but in fact have been chosen according to an agreement of the traditionally major parties, SPÖ and ÖVP. No consensus for a reform, which would have needed the backing of a two‐thirds majority in Parliament, was reached, however. In October, for the first time, an FPÖ candidate was nominated to become a member of the Court, changing the balance from 7 ÖVP and 7 SPÖ judges to 8 ÖVP/FPÖ and 6 SPÖ judges (the party attributions are based only on the fact of nomination by the party and tell little about the personal loyalties of the judges, who are mostly regarded as independent and autonomous). The conflict about the installation of additional local signs in Carinthia could not be solved before the end of the year.</p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP‐FPÖ government continued its reform path in 2002, but lost momentum. Most of the reforms met resistance from affected interest groups and the opposition parties, but also from parts of the governing parties or the provinces, be it the university reform (providing the universities with a more hierarchical organisational structure and with more budgetary autonomy), the budget transfers from profit to deficit health insurance funds, the abolition of a special court for juvenile delinquents or the closing down of finance offices, post offices, district courts and police stations. Only the reform of the system of lay‐off benefits, which was devised in cooperation with the major interest groups (the so‐called ‘social partners’), was widely recognised as a success.</p>
         
         <p>Indeed for two issues, people's initiatives (<i>Volksbegehren</i>) were started against government policies. In April, an initiative, started by a panel of representatives of the trade unions (including the Christian faction), church organisations, political scientists and others, demanded the insertion of the principle of the ‘welfare state’ into the constitution. The initiative was supported by the SPÖ, the Greens and Caritas, the charity organisation of the Catholic Church. It gained 717,102 signatures (12.2 per cent of the electorate). Almost as many signatures (624,807: 10.65 per cent of the electorate) were gathered by the initiative of the chairman of the small party ‘The Democrats’ against the purchase of the Eurofighters in August. The initiative was supported by provincial party organisations of the SPÖ, but signatures came from the whole party spectrum. The opposition parties’ demand for a national referendum about the Eurofighters was rejected by the Government, however, although the FPÖ was divided on the issue (Haider made the purchase dependent on a pension rise). After the summer floods, which required extraordinary government assistance, the purchase of the interceptors was postponed.
         </p>
         
         <p>European integration, in particular with regard to the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union to the Central and East European countries, ranked high on the political agenda during 2002. The FPÖ tried to use the issue to boost its declining figures in opinion polls. In January, a people's initiative, promoted by the FPÖ, was directed against the Czech nuclear power plant of Temelín near the Austrian border. Its aim was to oblige the government to veto European Union accession of the Czech Republic as long as the plant was still working. The FPÖ used the instrument of direct democracy, usually applied by opposition parties, to exert pressure on its coalition partner, the ÖVP (see also the Austria entry in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>). The initiative, which was also intensively promoted by the most widely read daily newspaper, the ‘<i>Kronenzeitung’</i>, but condemned by SPÖ and Greens, was signed by 914,973 people (15.5 per cent of the electorate). It showed that the FPÖ had still not come to terms with its new role as a ‘responsible’ governing party. It caused severe frictions within the coalition as the ÖVP stressed the historic dimension of European Union enlargement and rejected the idea of using a people's initiative to exert pressure on a foreign government. Chancellor Schüssel made it clear to the FPÖ that enlargement was the ‘core’ of the government programme and that without it the coalition would fall. Finally, the two parties reached a compromise that the veto option, the core of the people's initiative, should not be strictly pursued, but that a dialogue should be started with the Czech government on the Temelín issue as well as on the so‐called ‘Beneš decrees’ (sanctioning the expulsion and expropriation of the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia after 1945).
         </p>
         
         <p>The problem of truck transit through the Alpine regions of Tyrol was another conflict in the relations between Austria and the European Union. The system of eco‐points and limited number of truck passages per year, which was laid down in the transit treaty between Austria and the European Union in 1992, was to end in 2003. As in the Temelín case, the responsible ministers (from the FPÖ) threatened repeatedly that the Austrian government would block European Union enlargement if no satisfactory new regulation could be found. In the course of the year, however, Infrastructure Minister Reichhold showed his willingness to compromise and accepted the demand of the European Commission to abolish the limitation of truck passages. At the European Union summit in Copenhagen in December 2002, the Austrian delegation was not able to achieve any major concessions, either on the transit or on the Temelín issue. Given the historic dimension of European Union enlargement to the Central and East European countries, it came as no surprise that Austria did not play the veto card.</p>
