         <p>The internal disputes of a difficult‐to‐manage six‐party government became even more severe in 2013 due to emerging economic problems and the sale of the mobile phone maker Nokia to Microsoft – a move which severely damaged Finland's pride and economic confidence.</p>

         <p>The Social Democratic Party has suffered in opinion polls during its years in government. Chairman Jutta Urpilainen declared the dilemma facing the party: jobs continue to vanish from industrial work, which enhances insecurity among the traditional Social Democratic voters. A reshuffling of ministers is a means of refreshing the party profile when the government has reached the halfway point of its four‐year period in office. The party veteran Jukka Gustafsson was first on Urpilainen's list and he was replaced by Krista Kiuru, who left her appointment as Minister of Housing and Communications. Maria Guzenina‐Richardson was very successful in the 2011 election, but less successful in government. She has been heavily criticised for how she has led the ongoing reform process of health and social care. Urpilainen chose Susanna Huovinen to replace her. Huovinen has been an MP since 1999 and she was a minister from 2005 to 2007. Pia Viitanen, the new Minister of Housing and Communication, has been an MP since 1995. With this move, the Social Democratic group of ministers is younger and dominated by women as four out of six of their ministers are now female. Whether this change will boost the party support in polls is far from certain.</p>
         
         <p>The sacking of Minister Heidi Hautala was the result of an alleged misuse of power, which later after her resignation turned out to be a legitimate action. Heidi Hautala was minister in charge of the state‐owned company Arctia Shipping, whose main task is to break ice in the Baltic Sea. Out of season, ships are chartered for different purposes. In spring 2012 one of their ships, commissioned by Shell to break ice in the Arctic, was boarded in Helsinki by Greenpeace activists who set up a banner in protest. The captain of the ship intended to report the issue to the police. Hautala was informed and urged the captain to withdraw the report and her co‐worker Pekka Timonen wrote a message where he threatened to fire the captain if orders were not followed. In October 2013 the incident was published in a newspaper and Timonen took all responsibility for threating the captain. Hautala was accused of protecting Greenpeace, for whom she has warm sympathies as a Green minister. As Hautala had ‘forgotten’ to report the Timonen incident, she was accused of not disclosing all the details. Hautala took responsibility for her actions in the midst of heated media attention, and announced her resignation to calm down the situation and to protect her party. This still leaves open the question of what the responsibility of a minister is and whether politics should be prohibited in state business. It later emerged that she had not broken the law.</p>
         
         <p>Pekka Haavisto took over the portfolio of Minister of International Development. He is a veteran politician who was first elected to parliament in 1987, was chairman of the Green League from 1993 to 1995, and served as Minister for the Environment between 1995 and 1999. In 2012 he qualified to the second round in the Presidential election.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12046-sec-0005-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The conflict within the government and between the government and opposition has grown deeper than it has been for years. Achieving cooperation within a six‐party government ranging from the far left to the right was not easy from the very beginning, and has become increasingly complicated over time. Differences in ideology and old electoral promises are an obstacle for Prime Minister Katainen to overcome in negotiating dynamic collective policies. The opposition, on the other hand, has got more wind in their sails. In the 2011 election the Centre Party lost 7 per cent of votes and 16 seats in parliament. The result was a shock to the party. The time in opposition with the new leader Juha Sipilä has given new strength and confidence to the damaged party. Polls show increasing support and during the spring, the Centre Party overtook National Coalition as the most popular party. Their success continued, and in December their popularity rose to 23 per cent as compared to 18 per cent for National Coalition. The True Finns are closely behind, leaving the Social Democrats as the fourth most popular party at the end of the year.</p>
         
         <p>The focus changed after the 2011 election from EU issues towards more internal Finnish politics, giving an advantage to the Centre Party and a strategic disadvantage to the True Finns in opposition as criticising the EU and its economic crisis politics was the main theme of their election campaign in 2011. The government has been determined to implement the policies laid out in the cabinet programme from 2011. The biggest challenge for the government is to reform health and social care, combined with municipal amalgamations. The aim of these amalgamations is to create municipalities that are strong enough to take care of primary health and parts of more specialised health care. According to criteria in the reform plan, no municipalities with fewer than 20,000 inhabitant are allowed. This criterion is set to provide a stable base for the coming reform. Parallel to the municipality reform, those involved with the health and social reform in government propose a threshold of 50,000 inhabitants to bear responsibility for health care services, whereas experts have their doubts and recommend between 150,000 and 200,000 inhabitants. Others claim that this is not nearly enough to ensure specialised health care.</p>
         
         <p>The government has by no means acted in unison; coercion between the actors in the popularly named ‘six‐pack’ government has been manifest from the beginning. National Coalition is the main driving force in creating big solutions, followed by the Social Democrats. The other four small government parties have had severe difficulties in accepting the reform plan. It became even more problematic after the Minister of Public Administration and Local Government Henna Virkkunen (National Coalition) declared that municipal amalgamations could be made mandatory. During the electoral campaign in 2011, all party leaders promised that this would never happen. Since then, the promise has gradually been abandoned and the policy has shifted to a mandatory position. The entire reform process has been characterised by a magnitude of investigations and public reports from different ministries with different recommendations and charges, leaving the municipality governments in a state of confusion.</p>
         
         <p>Unsurprisingly, the messy process invited criticism from the opposition, who presented alternative solutions. The Centre Party, which has a stronghold in rural Finland dominated by relatively small municipalities, heavily criticised the government policy and (contrary to the True Finns) presented an alternative solution. Both opposition parties have criticised the mix of health care and municipal amalgamations which will hurt municipal autonomy and local democracy. Moreover, it will enhance centralisation and further discriminate against scarcely populated regions. As an alternative to the planned big and strong municipalities, the Centre Party has launched a regional model located between municipalities and the national government, enabling small municipalities to endure. According to the model, health and social care could be governed by the regional council. The council is supposed to be elected in general elections.</p>
         
         <p>All such attempts have strongly been rejected by National Coalition and the Social Democrats, and the problematic reform process continued throughout the remainder of the year, generating uncertainty of what would come next. The driving force behind the reform is financial as there is a strong belief that big and centralised solutions bring efficiency and budget cuts, although never verified by research. Prime Minister Katainen declared several times that Finland has to control rising mortgage rates, referring to unpleasant examples from southern Europe. Therefore, the government planned to include severe cuts in the general budget framework to be drawn up in early 2014. It is by no means an easy task to increase the active labour force. Time spent in universities is far too long, the population is ageing and the pension age, which now on average is around 61 years, must necessarily be higher. The pension age is much debated and consensus is not easily found in government as the Social Democrats oppose all plans to raise the formal age threshold. The labour market is diversified and the resistance is strongest among blue collar union members. In addition, the unemployment rate shows no signs of coming back down. Almost 9 per cent of the labour force is unemployed. As compared to figures from the 1980s, the decline in employment has hit people in middle age. Raising the pension age does not help much in getting the huge masses of unemployed middle aged people back to work, yet it is necessary as life expectancy has continued to increase.</p>
         
         <p>One big industry after another has made their organisation more effective by firing employees. The big shock came in early September when Nokia announced that Microsoft will be taking over the ownership of mobile phones. Production in Finland will cease, leaving 3,700 employees out of work in the small city of Salo where production is concentrated. In the year 2000, Nokia stocks commanded a market price of €260 billion; by September 2013, the mobile phone sector was only worth slightly over €5 billion. Although Microsoft promised that the corporation would stay in Finland to be a centre for Microsoft in Europe, these claims did not inspire great confidence. Nokia will continue as a middle‐sized mobile network producer. The managing director Stephen Elop, who led the company during its downfall, banked almost €19 million when Nokia was sold. He left Finland and was hired by Microsoft. According to a newly published book, Elop made a terrible mistake in choosing a Windows operating system that was not yet ready for the market (Cord <span><a href="#epdy12046-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12046-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>). In addition, Nokia was several years ahead of iPhones at the start of this century, but the arrogant leadership stopped production of touch screens abruptly, leaving no opportunity for objection from the innovative engineers. Leading politicians in the government and parliament commented on the Microsoft affair with suspicion, suggesting that the electronic industry in Finland will be weakened and will soon move abroad. Comments included those by the Minister of Justice, who asked why a person who is selling the best part of Nokia should receive such a high financial reward. A similar sentiment was expressed by the Minister of Labour, who called Elop a Trojan horse and suggesting that he prepared the move in conjunction with Microsoft from the very beginning.
         </p>
         
         <p>When Finland suffered from a deep economic decline in the early 1990s, Nokia mobile phones rose to conquer the world with new technology, emerging from a badly run company on the road to bankruptcy. The success of the mobile phone division was a core component in strengthening the badly hurt Finnish self‐confidence. Together with the increasing freedom of political movement in international affairs after the collapse of the Soviet Union, acquiring EU membership in 1995 and the introduction of the euro, the Finnish economy was bolstered. Nokia changed the global communication culture. Now it has gone and has left a deep scar as no other actor can replace Nokia in Finland. No wonder that it shocked the political establishment, who have struggled to find an alternative means of revitalising the stalled economy. Trade unions have moderated their wage demands in recognition of the economic crisis, and a welcome development (for the government) was set at the end of August when a centralised agreement was accepted by the employers and labour unions. Wages will rise by no more than €20 during the next year, and by 0.4 per cent the year after. With this centralised agreement a solidary labour policy not seen for years got a revival. Nevertheless, companies continued to dismiss members of their workforce and the degree of investment shows no signs of recovery.</p>
         
         <p>When parliament debated the government's report on foreign policy and defence, different views split the government parties. Pertti Salolainen from National Coalition underlined a closer military cooperation within the Nordic countries, the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. According to Salolainen, his parliamentary party supports NATO membership which could enhance the fulfilment of United Nations principles and strengthen the defence capacity of Finland. At the moment there is no intention to apply for membership before the forthcoming election in 2015. The key question is what Sweden intends to do. A close dialogue and cooperation with Sweden must therefore be undertaken, declared Minister of Defence Carl Haglund from the Swedish People's Party. Polls show that a majority of Finns do not approve of NATO membership. Left‐wing Alliance strongly opposes all intentions of moving closer to NATO. Finland shall maintain its policy of non‐alliance with any military power, with support from a number of incumbents from the opposition parties.</p>
         
         <p>The youth organisation of National Coalition has made headlines in recent years. In 2012 the vice chairman Saul Schubak declared that child aid should be abolished to prevent poor people from having children. Now the organisation launched a new programme led by the new chairwoman Susanna Koski, which includes policies that Finland should no longer welcome quota refugees, that foreign aid policy should stop, that the law protecting against the incitement of hatred of ethnic groups should be abolished, that the ombudsman for minorities should be repealed, and that Swedish in Finnish schools should be made a voluntary choice. The programme is in line with the most radical elements among the True Finns. In National Coalition, the programme was met with comments claiming that it is typical for the youth to be radical and challenging. The programme follows a wave strengthening Finnish nationalism. Polls show that 63 per cent of Finns want Swedish to be voluntary in Finnish schools, implying that Russian or some other language should be preferred before Swedish. A popular initiative on this matter got more than enough signatures and it will be debated in parliament next year. In the long run, the official bilingual status in Finland is in danger. Parliament is divided and the initiative is most strongly supported by True Finns.</p>
         
         <p>Nationalism has its limits. True Finn MP James Hirvisaari has made headlines for his racist statements. In 2011 he was sentenced and fined for inciting hatred against ethnic groups. Now his assistant proposed that minorities should wear signs on their clothes to facilitate the work of police and other officials. Hirivisaari defended her and the party took no serious action. However, when Hirvisaari welcomed his friend to follow a debate in parliament by making a Nazi salute in front of the cameras, the party got a serious warning from the chair of parliament and later Hirvisaari was expelled from the party. In addition, even the vice chair of the EU Commission, Neelie Kroes, reacted when more than ten well‐known female journalists were insulted and sent anonymous death threats via email. The female journalists have two things in common: they are Finnish Swedes and/or they are defending the status of Swedish in Finland. Unfortunately police investigations have not succeeded in identifying the perpetrator(s).</p>
