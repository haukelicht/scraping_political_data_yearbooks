         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12025-sec-0004-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg made several changes to the cabinet in 2012. The first was in March when Audun Lysbakken resigned as Minister of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion. His resignation was related to mistakes made at his ministry, which included conflicts of interest and funding blunders that inappropriately favoured young party members and a personal friend. Although the amount of money itself was small in a ministerial budget, the allocations defied proper political procedures and appeared to be part of a systematic violation of the rules. The opposition was highly critical, but Lysbakken still had the full confidence and support of his Socialist Left Party's outgoing veteran leader and fellow government minister Kristin Halvorsen and, even more importantly, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg of the Labour Party. When Lysbakken declared that he was giving up his post with immediate effect, Stoltenberg said he ‘respected’ Lysbakken's decision. By resigning, Lysbakken said he was taking full responsibility for the mistakes made by himself and his fellow political leaders. What complicated the case further was that Lysbakken was the most likely new incoming leader of the Socialist Left Party (SV), and that leaders of parties with government power almost always hold ministerial posts, especially in a coalition government. So in spite of his missteps, it was argued that it still would be possible for Lysbakken to head another ministry at a later date.</p>
         
         <p>The change of leadership in the Socialist Left Party and Lysbakken's resignation triggered further changes in the cabinet. For the party it was important that the new leadership team in SV was represented in the cabinet. Newly elected deputy leader Inga Marte Thorkildsen took over the post as Minister of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion. The other deputy leader, Bård Vegar Solhjell, re‐entered the cabinet – this time as Minister of the Environment (Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy12025-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12025-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>: 1089–1090), while the runner‐up in the party leadership race, Heikki Holmås, was given the post of new Minister of International Development. All three new ministers were members of parliament at the time they were selected. To make room for the new party leadership in the cabinet, party veteran (and former party leader), Minister of Environment and International Development Erik Solheim, was forced to resign. He made it clear that he was not happy with this decision. Another long‐time member of the party, Minister of Research and Higher Education Tora Aasland, also resigned.
         </p> 
         <p>The second round of changes came in June when Prime Minister Stoltenberg announced the replacement of two Centre Party ministers. Agriculture Minister Lars Peder Brekk was replaced by his party colleague Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, who had been a Centre Party MP since 2005. Minister of Transport Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa also resigned. She had been widely criticised over Norway's ailing road and public transport systems, despite a major boost in funding and seven years with the Centre Party in control of the transport ministry. She was replaced by Marit Arnstad – a veteran Centre Party politician and former energy minister in a previous centre‐right government.</p>
         
         <p>The third round of changes to the cabinet came in September, when the Labour Party changed and relocated several of its ministers. Arguably, the new ministerial line‐up was aimed to help the Labour Party win re‐election in September 2013. Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, who for a long time had been considered the coalition government's strongest minister, was asked to take over as the new Minister of Health.</p>
         
         <p>At the time, health was among the most embattled of ministries, and criticism had been hurled at Health Minister Anne‐Grete Strøm‐Erichsen for months over ongoing budget cuts, reorganisation of hospitals and the responsibility between state‐run hospitals and community‐run health care services. Commentators suggested that the prime minister was calling on his ‘best man’ to fix one of his government's most glaring problems. Some also speculated that the move was part of Stoltenberg's efforts to groom Støre as his own replacement as leader of the Labour Party and its next prime ministerial candidate. A move to the health ministry would give Støre valuable experience in domestic politics after years of running Norway's foreign policy. Strøm‐Erichsen was moved back to the ministry she headed before taking over as health minister in 2009, and resumed her post as Minister of Defence, replacing Espen Barth Eide, who moved to Støre's previous post in the Foreign Ministry.</p>
         
         <p>The only minister who left the cabinet was Labour's Hanne Bjurstrøm. Apparently, the main reason behind her resignation was to create room for one of the ‘bright young stars’ of the Labour Party – Hadia Tajik. She became the new Minister of Culture, and was the youngest minister (aged 29 on her appointment) and first Muslim to enter a Norwegian cabinet. Tajik's predecessor, Anniken Huitfeldt, was appointed Minister of Labour.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12025-sec-0002-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>On 21 May, parliament passed a comprehensive change to the Norwegian Constitution. Paragraph 2 was edited to remove the clause that the ‘Evangelical Lutheran Faith is the Religion of the State’, and now declares that the Norwegian ‘value base is our Christian and Humanitarian inheritance’. With this change, Norway became a secular state. For the political debate leading up to this change, see Aalberg (<span><a href="#epdy12025-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12025-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2007</a></span>, <span><a href="#epdy12025-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12025-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2009</a></span>).

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12025-sec-0003-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The terror attacks of 22 July 2011 continued to influence public debate in 2012 (Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy12025-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12025-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). The political parties were cautious not to interfere with, or express opinions about, the lengthy trial against the confessed terrorist, Anders Behring Breivik. However, the court was faced with two court‐appointed psychiatric reports that disagreed on whether Breivik was sane or insane, and thus accountable for his actions. The question of accountability was vital as to whether he would be sentenced to jail instead of being committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. This triggered a public debate about sentencing policies and mental health care, and accelerated the passing of a new law to increase security within psychiatric care. Some of the parties in the opposition – the Liberals (V), the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Progress Party (FrP) – were highly critical of the new law and argued that it was a violation of human rights, and that mental patients now run the risk of being treated as criminals. They also criticised the new law for being based on one particular case. The final verdict in the trial against Breivik was that he was regarded sane; he was sentenced to 21 years in prison plus a possible five years of protective custody. He may be subject to further five‐year extensions for the rest of his life or until he is no longer considered dangerous.
         </p>
         
         <p>More political debate arose in August when the government‐appointed commission probing the emergency response to the terror attacks unleashed a barrage of criticism against the police, politicians and the government itself. According to the July 22 Commission, all three institutions failed to implement better communication and security measures that might have warded off the attacks or improved reaction to them. Commission leader Alexandra Bech Gjørv, an attorney appointed by Prime Minister Stoltenberg to lead the investigation into the emergency response to the attacks, went so far as to state that the bombing of Norway's government headquarters could have been prevented if security measures already approved when the attacks occurred had been implemented. Instead, there had been years of delays – for example, in permanently closing to vehicular traffic a street which runs through the government complex. The Commission's report also concluded that the police could have stopped the bomber from making his way to the island of Utøya, or should have responded much more quickly to the subsequent massacre he carried out there. It was also stated that better routines and a ‘broader focus’ could have alerted the police intelligence unit (PST) to the threat Breivik posed prior to his attacks, but they had no basis for stating that the PST could or should have warded off the attacks. Prime Minister Stoltenberg, who won praise for his leadership during the tragedy in 2011, accepted the criticism for the nation's lack of preparedness. At an historic hearing in November, Stoltenberg became the first Norwegian prime minister to submit himself to questioning by the parliament's disciplinary committee. He took ultimate responsibility for what went wrong during and after last year's terrorist attacks, but also declared that he had no intention of stepping down as prime minister. He argued that being responsible entailed ordering the Commission's report, learning from it and taking action to improve emergency preparedness. In earlier hearings, also related to the terror attack, there had been allegations that many top officials in government and the emergency services thought someone <i>else</i> had been responsible – not themselves. That led to accusations from the media and the opposition that the incumbent government was shirking its own responsibility and blaming others, and that overall responsibility was ‘pulverised’. Although the opposition was highly critical, there was no demand for a vote of no‐confidence. This was partly because of the incumbent parties' parliamentary majority, but also because none of the opposition parties wanted to take over less than a year before the next scheduled general election.
         </p>
         
         <p>During the year, debate was heated within the coalition over attempts to agree on how to meet the emissions reduction goals set by parliament back in 2008. Disagreement ran between the government's dominant and generally industry‐friendly Labour Party and its partners – the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Center Party (SP). The government's scheduled climate report had been postponed several times (see Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy12025-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12025-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 239–240), but in 2012 they finally delivered the white paper. They also managed to reach a broad compromise with all the opposition parties, with the exception of the Progress Party. The new climate compromise declares that all sectors of society, from industry to housing to transport, should take their share of emission cuts. The compromise also supported the establishment of a new ‘climate and energy fund’ that should help finance new technology aimed at reducing emissions. The industry was nonetheless relieved, as some of the toughest and most expensive measures needed to cut emissions, such as demands for carbon capture facilities or closure of plants, were left out. The Progress Party argued that the exclusion of its party from the broad compromise was based on a strategic game, where the coalition parties wanted to split the opposition before next year's general election. Media commentators and several of the other parties agreed that the Progress Party had actually played a constructive role in the negotiations, after years of questioning climate change, but Labour declared that the opposition was so divided that it would have been impossible to reach a compromise with them all.
         </p>
         
         <p>Immigration was another important issue in 2012, and a controversy arose over a proposal to let 450 refugee children remain in Norway, even if their parents' application for asylum was rejected. Labour was at first divided on the issue, but at the party convention in March the leadership won support for its view and a majority voted against the proposal. The Socialist Left Party supported the proposal, as did the Liberals and the Christian Democrats. The debate was related to a white paper that was presented to the parliament in June. The compromise within the government was that arguments related to ‘the best interest of the child’ should be given more weight over so‐called ‘immigration‐regulating consideration’. In practice this indicated that the government did not support new legislation, but that they asked the Immigration Appeals Board (<i>Utlendningsnemnda</i>, UNE) to more strongly consider the children's attachment to Norwegian society, including the period of residency after a decision of denial had been reached. The opposition, including the Christian Democrats, the Liberals and the Conservatives, criticised the government for an exclusion of liability by not implementing new laws or regulations that would follow up their preferred policy.
         </p>
         
         <p>Questions of inability and scandals also dominated public debate during the year. The most dramatic concerned Audun Lysbakken, Minister of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion and current leader of the Socialist Left Party, who resigned from his post in the cabinet (see <a class="sectionLink scrollableLink" href="#epdy12025-sec-0004-title"><b>Changes in the cabinet</b></a>). But questions of inability were also directed towards other ministers. Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre was accused of favouring an old friend when the ministry allocated funding for a foundation in northern Norway, and allegedly helped secure some necessary permits. Trade Minister Trond Giske had to face a parliamentary disciplinary committee over charges that he was trying to appoint personal friends to top positions in state‐owned firms. Critics claimed that the committee was stooping to partisan politics.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was also a lot of public attention directed towards three sex scandals. In February, the deputy leader of the Liberals (V) resigned over allegations of rape. In March, a high‐ranking member of the Labour Party and trusted mayor of a mountain town was indicted and charged with the sexual assault of a now 16 year‐old girl. The sensational court case received a lot of media attention, the mayor refused to resign and the case created controversy within the Labour Party. In December, he was sentenced to four years in jail as the court found him guilty of sexual misconduct with a minor. Another sex scandal broke out that month when the state secretary in the Trade Ministry and leading candidate for a seat in parliament from the Labour Party's Troms chapter in northern Norway, was forced to resign for having had a sexual relationship eight years previously with a teenage party member.</p>
