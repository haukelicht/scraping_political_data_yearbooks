         <p>The political year 2013 was quiet. The economy showed signs of recovery, and there were no serious political scandals. Two ministers resigned, in largely uncontroversial circumstances. Unlike 2011 and 2012, none of the parliamentary parties changed leader. The eyes of politicians as well as commentators and the public were set on the ‘super election year’ of 2014 when elections to the European and national parliaments, as well as local and regional councils, were due to be held. For the centre‐right Alliance government, however, 2013 was difficult, with opinion polls indicating consistent and increasing leads for the red‐green opposition parties (i.e., the Social Democrats, the Left Party and the Greens).</p>

         <p>There were two ministerial changes in 2013. The first occurred on 21 January with the resignation of Nyamko Sabuni of the People's Party Liberals, Deputy Minister for Education and Minister for Gender Equality. Sabuni had indicated in 2012 that she was not planning to continue beyond the 2014 election. The announcement that she was stepping down was therefore no surprise, although it had no obvious concrete reason. She had not made any serious mistakes or been involved in scandals, but her political impact had been limited. She had been given responsibility for ethnic integration and gender equality when the Alliance government took office in 2006. After the 2010 election, however, her remit was reduced to gender equality plus a few minor areas related to education. This was regarded by some as a <i>de facto</i> demotion. Sabuni's successor, Maria Arnholm, was recruited from the same party. Not well‐known to the public, Arnholm had most recently served below ministerial level in the Ministry of Education, directly under Sabuni. She had previously held key posts in business, and had also held important positions in politics, although her elevation to government was her introduction to the political frontline. Her parliamentary experience is limited to a few weeks as a short‐term substitute in 1987.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second change took place on 17 September when Gunilla Carlsson of the Moderate Party, Minister for Foreign Aid since 2006, resigned. Carlsson's departure cannot be described as scandal‐driven, but she had made enemies in her attempts to rationalise the Swedish International Development Agency and her demands of more efficiency among aid recipients. Aid was phased out to a number of countries during Carlsson's tenure. Most controversial were reports, published a week after the resignation, which contained allegations that Carlsson's salary had been paid out of the foreign aid budget. The departure of Carlsson led to a minor reshuffle. Employment Minister Hillevi Engström took over Foreign Aid, while Elisabeth Svantesson was brought into the government to take charge of Employment. With unemployment remaining high despite an economic recovery, the change could be regarded as a downward move for Engström who, although still in the government, lost charge of a ministry. Also Engström had dealt with problems in public agencies below her ministry. On 25 August, she dismissed Angeles Bermudez Svankvist from the post as director general of the Swedish Public Employment Service due to alleged organisational and cooperation issues. Employment was a key issue for the Alliance government, and Svantesson was faced with a difficult but crucial task in the run‐up to the 2014 elections. A member of parliament since 2006, and chair of the standing committee on employment from 2012 until joining the government, Svantesson is an economist with postgraduate qualifications. Her appointment was regarded in some circles as controversial due to her earlier involvement in the pro‐life religious organisation Word of Life. None of the personnel changes altered the political direction of the government. The gender balance and party composition remained unchanged.</p>
         
         <p>Opinion polls were not positive for the government. An Ipsos poll published by the newspaper <i>Dagens Nyheter</i> in early February indicated a narrow lead for the governing parties over the left‐green opposition bloc (the Social Democrats, the Left Party and the Greens; <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 3 February 2013). This turned out to be an isolated occurrence, however. For the remainder of 2013 every poll, irrespective of polling organisation, indicated clear and growing leads for the opposition. Towards the end of the year, the gap was often over ten percentage points. The situation was particularly worrying for the Centre and Christian Democratic parties, which were frequently below the 4 per cent representational threshold. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt remained the most popular party leader but Stefan Löfven, leader of the Social Democrats since January 2012, was closing up behind him. There was no obvious reason for this development except that after seven years of the Alliance government some voters wanted a change. Although growing, the opposition lead was usually not big enough to suggest an outright majority for the opposition bloc. This was because the Sweden Democrats (SD) consolidated their position with ratings nearing, sometimes surpassing, the 10 per cent mark. There were signs of a systematic difference between SD's ratings in polls based on telephone interviews compared to Internet surveys. In the telephone‐based TNS Sifo poll, for example, the highest rating for SD was 9.9 per cent, while the party was rarely below 10 per cent in polls by the Internet‐based YouGov, whose highest rating for SD was 12.9 per cent.

         <p>Since the entry of the Sweden Democrats in 2010, the Alliance government has not commanded a parliamentary majority. This has resulted in a number of defeats in parliamentary votes, and has also meant that the government has refrained from making reform proposals that run the risk of being defeated (Widfeldt <span title=""><a href="#epdy12069-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12069-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). The budget process is protected by rules, introduced in the 1990s, which make it difficult for the opposition to make changes in government budget proposals (Pierre &amp; Widfeldt <span title=""><a href="#epdy12069-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12069-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">1997</a></span>). With the unclear parliamentary situation since 2010, however, it has turned out that the budget regulations are not as protective of a minority government as had previously been believed. Not long after the 2010 election, a number of cuts in the government organisation were enforced against the will of the government when the Sweden Democrats voted with the red‐green parties (Widfeldt <span title=""><a href="#epdy12069-bib-0012" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12069-bib-0012R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The ambiguities of the budget regulations, and the pivotal power of the Sweden Democrats, became even more apparent in 2013. The budget, presented in September, contained income tax cut proposals that could be divided into two main parts. The first was an increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) – in practice, an income tax reduction of up to SEK337 (approximately €37) per month.<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12069-note-0001_6-controller" href="#epdy12069-note-0001_6" aria-controls="epdy12069-note-0001_6" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Note">1</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12069-note-0001_6" aria-labelledby="epdy12069-note-0001_6-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><span aria-labelledby="Footnote 1" title="Footnote 1"><span class="number">1 </span>The Earned Income Tax Credit (in Swedish ‘<i>jobbskatteavdrag</i>’; literally ‘job tax deduction’) was first introduced by the Alliance government in 2006. Despite its name in Swedish, it is not a tax deduction, but a reduction of the amount of tax payable on income from work.<br></span><span class="chevronDown"></span></span> The government had reduced income tax via the EITC in four steps during the 2006–2010 parliamentary term, but abandoned plans for a fifth step in 2011. Officially the step‐down was motivated by an economic downturn, but fears that SD would vote with the red‐green parties to defeat the proposal may also have played a part (Widfeldt <span title=""><a href="#epdy12069-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12069-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). With the economy improving, however, the 2013 budget contained a proposal for a fifth step in the EITC. Second, the 2013 budget contained a proposal to raise the income threshold, above which state tax is payable, from an annual income of SEK420,000 to SEK436,000 (the latter being approximately €48,000). This would have meant that around one in ten of the c.1 million income earners who pay state income tax would no longer have to do so.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Social Democratic, Left and Green parties were all opposed to both these tax cut proposals. The Sweden Democrats had indicated willingness to reconsider their earlier opposition to a fifth step in the EITC, which was thus certain to be approved by parliament. SD was, however, opposed to raising the state tax threshold. The government parties claimed that the proposed tax changes were part of the budget, which has to be decided as a single package and cannot be itemised. This was rejected by the opposition parties and an intense debate, about substance as well as procedure, followed. On 23 October, an opposition initiative to reject the proposed change to the state tax threshold failed, essentially due to poor organisation. For example, some opposition representatives failed to turn up in time for the vote. The budget, with overall income and expenditure specified and the change to the state tax threshold included, was approved by parliament on 20 November. In early December, the non‐government parties, including SD, enforced an initiative by the standing Committee on Finance. According to the initiative, the proposed change to the state tax threshold would be voted upon as a separate item in the chamber.</p>
         
         <p>The speaker, Per Westerberg, ruled that the opposition initiative was in breach of the budget process regulations in the Riksdag Act, and declined to put it to a vote.<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12069-note-0002_8-controller" href="#epdy12069-note-0002_8" aria-controls="epdy12069-note-0002_8" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Note">2</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12069-note-0002_8" aria-labelledby="epdy12069-note-0002_8-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><span aria-labelledby="Footnote 2" title="Footnote 2"><span class="number">2 </span>The Riksdag Act (<i>Riksdagsordningen</i>) regulates the organisation of, and work in, the national parliament, the <i>Riksdag</i>. It can be amended in a single decision, with a three‐quarter majority, and is therefore not regarded as constitutional. Laws with constitutional status can only be amended with two identical decisions, with an ordinary election (i.e., an election not caused by a premature dissolution of parliament) between them.<br></span><span class="chevronDown"></span></span> The chamber persisted, and decided that the initiative should still be voted upon. In accordance with the Riksdag Act, the speaker then referred the matter to the standing Committee on the Constitution, whose majority ruled that the opposition initiative was not in breach of the Riksdag Act. The eventual vote was held on 11 December. The Social Democrats, the Greens, the Left Party and SD voted together, and the government was defeated. Parliament had thus decided not to change the threshold for payment of state income tax, despite the fact that the budget – which otherwise remained intact – had contained such a proposal. The whole controversy showed that the regulations surrounding the budget process, which were intended to facilitate political and economic stability, are open to different interpretations. Events since 2010 show that it is possible for parliament to amend individual parts of the government budget as long as it does not mean a net expenditure increase.<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12069-note-0003_9-controller" href="#epdy12069-note-0003_9" aria-controls="epdy12069-note-0003_9" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Note">3</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12069-note-0003_9" aria-labelledby="epdy12069-note-0003_9-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><span aria-labelledby="Footnote 3" title="Footnote 3"><span class="number">3 </span>The entire process is summarised in <i>Riksdag och Departement</i>, issue 35/2013.

         <p>Defence is usually not very prominent in the Swedish political debate, but reached the agenda on a number of occasions in 2013. Swedish defence has undergone a profound restructuring since the 1990s, from a conscription‐based defence against invasions to a smaller professional high‐tech organisation, mainly geared towards more specific operations at home and abroad. Conscription was formally abolished in 2010, although it had in practice been in the process of phasing out for some time, and a large number of military bases were closed down. The reorganisation has led to a significantly weakened defence, which was particularly highlighted on two occasions in 2013. In a newspaper interview, first published on 30 December 2012, the commander‐in‐chief, General Sverker Göranson, stated that when the defence reorganisation is complete, Sweden can at best defend itself against a military attack for seven days, provided the attack is confined to a specific part of the country (<i>Svenska Dagbladet</i>, 30 December 2012; <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 3 January 2013).
         </p>
         
         <p>The Defence Minister Karin Enström essentially agreed with Göranson's seven‐day assessment, but argued that this is a satisfactory military capacity (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 9 January 2013). In April, however, it was reported that Russian military aircraft came close to Swedish territory without a response from the Swedish air force (<i>Svenska Dagbladet</i>, 22 April 2013; <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 23 April 2013). The government tried to play down the incident, but to most observers it was a sign of military weakness. A cross‐party report on the Swedish security situation, published on 31 May, voiced concerns about developments in Russia, although it did not envisage any military threat against Sweden in the foreseeable future. There are, however, issues that could have medium to long‐term security implications. An example is the Nordstream gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, opened in 2011, which passes through the Baltic Sea near Swedish territorial waters.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another issue subject to much attention was social unrest. Riots in the Stockholm suburb of Husby, beginning in the evening of 19 May, received national as well as international attention (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 21 May 2013, and several subsequent dates). The unrest spread to other suburbs. The extent of the riots should not be overstated; there were no serious personal injuries, but cars and properties, including schools and police stations, were set on fire and there was extensive vandalism. Police and firefighters were attacked. The triggering factor was reported to have been the fatal shooting by police, six days before the beginning of the riots, of a 69 year‐old man in what had seemed like a routine call. The riots lasted for about a week, but they led to a protracted and divisive political debate. There were also clashes involving militant racist groups. One example occurred on 15 December, when an anti‐racist demonstration in Kärrtorp (another Stockholm suburb) was brutally attacked (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 16 December 2013, and subsequent dates).
         </p>
         
         <p>Economically, the pattern of stagnation from previous years was broken. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.5 per cent in 2013, compared to 0.9 per cent in 2012, according to a report published in March 2014 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER). The NIER projected a continued recovery, to a growth of 2.6 per cent in 2014 and 3.2 per cent in 2015. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12‐month changes in the Consumer Price Index) oscillated around the zero mark, and was consistently below the central bank <i>Riksbanken</i>'s target rate of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of +/–1 percentage point. <i>Riksbanken</i> nevertheless let the Repo interest remain at 1.00 per cent for most of the year, until lowering it to 0.75 per cent with a decision taken on 16 December. After a rather generous budget proposal in September, the government started to hint at a more cautious approach towards the end of the year, carefully avoiding further reform promises. In December, Finance Minister Anders Borg even suggested that future tax increases may be necessary to maintain fiscal stability.
         </p>
         
         <p>The opposition, however, argued that the government was in the process of undermining the public finances. This was a matter of interpretation, but the fiscal deficit as well as national debt grew in 2013. According to figures from the National Debt Office, there was a fiscal deficit of SEK131 billion (approximately €15 billion) for 2013 – an increase of SEK106 billion compared to 2012. According to the same organisation, the national debt grew to SEK1,277 billion (approximately €140 billion) in 2013, an increase of SEK131 billion compared to 2012. Relative to GDP, the national debt increased from 32 to 35 per cent. The difficulties on the labour market were not over, although there were some signs of improvement. The overall rate of unemployment, as a percentage of the population aged 16–64, rose to 6.7 per cent (3.6 per cent in open unemployment and 3.1 per cent in labour market schemes) – an increase of 0.2 percentage points compared to 2012. The total number of redundancies went down from 71,000 to 58,000, and the unemployment level was projected to start declining, albeit slowly, in 2014 and 2015 (figures and projections from the Swedish Public Employment Service).</p>
