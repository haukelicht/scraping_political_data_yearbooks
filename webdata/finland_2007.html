         <p>During the year, two ministers resigned. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ilkka Kanerva had to step down as he had been involved in a scandal with a sex dancer. Kanerva proved to have sent hundreds of intimate text messages using his official cell phone to the dancer, Johanna Tukiainen, and her sister. He denied all the allegations in a television news programme, but later had to confess when a magazine published the messages. First the Conservative party leader and Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen defended Kanerva, but as the scandal escalated in the media, he had to take action. It was not the first time Kanerva had been involved in similar affairs, but up until that point he had always been saved by the protective attitude of his party. A new foreign minister was not chosen from the national parliament. Instead, Alexander Stubb, an MEP, left Brussels to take over the Cabinet seat.</p>
         
         <p>In December, Minister of Education, Sari Sarkomaa, announced that she would resign as it was proving too difficult to combine her work in government with the demands of a family with small children. The Cabinet is exceptional as 60 per cent of the members are female. Sarkomaa praised the efforts of the Cabinet to facilitate the combination of work and family life (the Minister of Environment, Paula Lehtomäki, was on maternity leave for half a year, for example), but the outgoing minister concluded that it was not possible for her to stay.</p>
         
         <p>One important issue in Finnish politics was the approval of the Lisbon Treaty. Prior to the parliamentary debate, the Left Wing Alliance proposed rejecting it on the grounds that approval should only take place with support of a referendum. The autonomous Åland Islands also attached conditions for accepting the agreement in their regional parliament (lagting). Four demands were printed on the agenda: a seat in the European Parliament, more consideration of Åland in the Commission and Council of Ministers, the ability to pursue action in the European Court of Justice, and Åland being allowed to have a say in how the monitoring of subsidiarity is achieved.</p>
         
         <p>Parliament approved the Lisbon agreement with 151 votes for and 27 against in August. A qualified majority was required for approval and this criterion was easily fulfilled. However, the approval and the ratification by the President in October met protests in the Åland lagting. None of the four demands had been fulfilled prior to the ratification. The Cabinet rejected the demand of a permanent Åland seat in the EP. From the 2009 election, the Finnish seats are reduced from 14 to 13 in the EP and none of the Finnish parties was ready to give away one for this purpose, except for the Swedish People's Party, which made a plea for a joint Swedish seat with the Åland Islands. This means that Finland might be represented in the EU parliament solely by unilingual Finnish MEPs even though Finland is officially a bilingual country. The Government promised, however, to consider the other demands and the Åland lagting agreed to come to a final decision in 2009. This opens up the possibility that the Lisbon agreement might not come into force in the Åland Islands.</p>
         
         <p>According to law, candidates in all public elections have to fill in a form to declare how their campaign is financed. Studies show that individual candidates do not necessarily take the rule seriously. This anomaly has not attracted much public attention. However, a massive debate started when a Centre Party MP openly declared that he did not fill the form correctly since he was not obliged to do it. Soon it became clear to the media and public that this form of cheating is common among MPs and other candidates. Investigations were undertaken by the media and it soon became clear that financial irregularities were occurring not just during campaigns, but also between elections. The Prime Minister and his Centre Party denied all allegations, but it became evident that business interests via a charity had financed their campaign and had also tried to influence decision making. As a result of the debate, the Prime Minister lost the confidence of many voters.</p>
         
         <p>The former Social Democrat Prime Minister and Speaker of Parliament, Paavo Lipponen, was hired by the Russians (Gazprom) to lobby for the Russian‐German‐Dutch pipeline project Nord Stream. According to the plan, a 1,200 kilometre‐long gas pipe will be constructed at the bottom of the Baltic Sea leading to Germany. The project is not supported by many countries around the Baltic. Lipponen's job is to persuade the Finnish government to accept the plan. In contrast to Sweden and the Baltic States, the Finnish government is positive about the project, given that the pipes will not harm the environment in the Baltic Sea. Pipes are already stored in the harbour towns Kotka and Hangö, which will serve as bases for the construction fleet. Finland has a long tradition of friendship with Soviet and post‐Soviet Russia – in contrast to its Baltic and Swedish neighbours. The strongest protests have been raised by the small Fishermen's Union and different environmental groups.</p>
         
         <p>The worldwide economic recession came late to Finland, but exports began to drop away during the autumn. As a result, the Government had to take action. Most importantly, the budget needed adjustment to meet the new situation. The export industry would be supported by loans and the construction industry by advanced public investment, while consumption would be stimulated by lowering the tax rate for employees. The stimulus package resulted in a budget deficit that will be financed by a €2 billion loan. Vanhanen's budget was well received by the unions and the employers' organisations, and even the opposition had some good words to say.</p>
         
         <p>One measure of the Government's popularity was the municipal elections in October. Prime Minister Vanhanen's Centre Party suffered losses mainly due to the fact that voters in the rural periphery felt disappointed with their own party. Under Vanhanen's leadership, the party has shifted focus from the periphery to the urban south. People in the rural areas increasingly feel they have few political defenders. Centralisation, big units and efficiency seem to have been adopted by the party. The planned municipality amalgamations are an example of the Centre Party's shifting profile: traditionally the party has defended small rural municipalities, but by the end of 2008 the number will be reduced from 415 to 348 – a reform that is supposed to save a lot of money, though by no means everyone agrees that it will. The election was a success for the populist True Finns who seemed set fair to challenge established parties in the European election in 2009.</p>
