         <p>On 31 July 2006, Federal Councillor Joseph Deiss (1946 male, CVP), Head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs (<i>Volkswirtschaftsdepartement</i>, EVD) resigned. Since the Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP) had lost one of their two seats in the Federal Council to the Swiss People's Party in 2003, their claim to keep the single seat was not challenged by any other party. The reason for this lies in the principle of Swiss ‘concordance’ (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hardmeier 2004</a></span>). The Christian Democrats presented only one candidate: the relatively young party president Doris Leuthard, who, on 14 June 2006, was elected on the first ballot with 133 votes. She took up office as Head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs on 1 August 2006. Leuthard became, with Micheline Calmy‐Rey, one of two female Federal Councillors in a Cabinet of seven. Meanwhile, Moritz Leuenberger, representing the Social Democratic Party, was the elected President of the Swiss Federation. He also presides over the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (<i>Eidgenössisches Departement für Umwelt, Verkehr, Energie und Kommunikation</i>, UVEK).

         <p>Since Swiss parliamentary elections had taken place in 2003, there were no major changes in 2006. Eight Members of the lower house (<i>Nationalrat</i>) resigned and one died. An additional change took place when Leuthard (from the canton of Aargau) was replaced on her promotion into the cabinet. Claude Janiak (from the canton of Basel‐Land) presided over the lower house until 4 December, and was succeeded by Christine Egerszegi‐Obrist (canton of Aargau). The upper house (<i>Ständerat</i>) has remained unchanged. Rolf Büttiker (canton of Solothurn) presided over the upper house until 4 December 2006. His successor is Peter Bieri‐Luthinger (canton of Zug).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Results of national referenda and initiatives</h2>
         
         <p>In 2006, Swiss voters were asked to cast a ballot six times. At the first ballot in 2006 over the Federal Constitution's framework article on education, the result was clear, but based on political apathy. An exceptionally overwhelming majority of 85.6 per cent supported the harmonisation of the Swiss education system. Likewise exceptional was the attendance at the poll: the participation rate of 27.2 per cent hit nearly the all‐time low of 1972 (26.7 per cent). The data from the survey taken immediately after the ballot (VOX‐Analysis) asserts the massive approval of the article of education. The voters were not split and made their unequivocal decision nearly independent from their socio‐demographic and political characteristics. The conservative supporters of the Swiss People's Party (SVP) agreed to the harmonisation of education on a lower level (68 per cent) than the partisans of the other major parties (90 per cent) (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Engeli &amp; Nicolet 2006</a></span>). Nevertheless, their verdict was also non‐ambiguous. The small opposition feared a decline of the cantons' sovereignty and assessed the new article on education as unnecessary. Since all the major parties recommended the harmonisation, no one invested in an intensive public campaign. Consequently the mobilisation of voters was marginal due to ignorance and lack of subjective feelings of involvement.
         </p>
         
         <p>As the next ballot approached, harmony came to an end. In September, the voters decided on the new foreigners' law and amended asylum law, and on the proposal to divert national bank profits to the old‐age and survivors' pension scheme (AHV). The referenda and the initiative were based on the efforts of the political left, with the centre‐right parties forming the opposition. The referenda on the foreigners' law bill and the asylum bill were closely linked since certain issues, necessary for enforcement of the asylum law, are ruled by immigration legislation. The Agreement on Free Movement of Persons with the European Union grants citizens of EU Member States free access to the Swiss labour market. This regulation applies also to citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) nations. Thus, the new law is predominantly relevant for ‘third country’ citizens and stipulates that these people can enter Switzerland only if they are professionally well‐qualified. While The Federal Council and the centre‐right parties backed the law, Social Democrats and Greens rejected it. They demanded a more generous immigration policy for citizens of third countries, especially for immigrants with no official papers. This demand had not been successful in Parliament. Also their opposition to tougher custodial sentences for asylum seekers had been overruled. Consequently the Greens and various foreigners' associations tabled a referendum.</p>
         
         <p>The reform of asylum legislation was effectively a tightening of the regulations since immigrants without valid papers would no longer have the right to seek asylum in the first place, only if they can give a credible explanation for the lack of official papers. Additionally, the bill implied the abolition of welfare payments to all rejected asylum seekers. Even the right to emergency assistance was restricted and was only granted to those failed asylum seekers who cooperated with their extradition. Against this tough asylum legislation was ranged widespread opposition: it was composed of the left‐wing parties, the Social Democrats and Greens, ecclesiastical bodies as well as cities governed by left coalitions. For all of them, the asylum bill was a breach of international law and a contradiction of Switzerland's humanitarian traditions. In contrast, the proponents considered the tougher regulations as an instrument to combat an abuse of the system.</p>
         
         <p>Even though the electorate voted separately on the two bills, they were obviously understood as one issue, both receiving 68 per cent backing with some 90 per cent of voters casting an identical vote for both bills in question (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic &amp; Scheuss 2006</a></span>). In every canton, the left‐green referenda foundered and both bills were adopted – in the German speaking parts of Switzerland unequivocally; in the French speaking parts (including Geneva, Jura and Neuenburg) only with a razor‐thin majority.
         </p>
         
         <p>As well as revealing that a large number of voters had little idea what the ballots were really about, the post‐vote VOX Analysis shows that their decisions were primarily determined by self‐positioning on the right‐left‐scale and by party identification, although the partisans of the centre‐right parties showed more discipline than social democratic voters (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic &amp; Scheuss 2006</a></span>). A third dominant impact was the perceived credibility of Federal Councillor Christoph Blocher. As federal minister of justice and police, the polarising and controversial politician was responsible for the tightening of the regulations in question: those who considered the minister of the Swiss People's Party trustworthy overwhelmingly backed the bills, while those who did not were much more likely to reject them (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic &amp; Scheuss 2006</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The only constitutional initiative people were asked to decide in 2006 was launched by the political left. The demand was to redirect some of the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) profits to the old‐age and survivors' pension scheme (AHV) in order to offset serious shortfalls over the next two decades. The federal government, as well as Parliament, opposed this initiative. The cantons, the Swiss National Bank and the centre and right‐wing parties took up the same negative stance. First of all, they feared the loss of the National Bank's independence. Simultaneously, they argued that the proponents over‐estimated the potential of the National Bank's returns; 58.3 per cent of the voters agreed with them and cast a ‘no’ vote.</p>
         
         <p>Although the decisions were mainly determined by party attachment, indications of cost‐benefit calculations are evident: the post‐vote VOX Analysis reveals that people in their fifties (coming up to retirement age) gave relatively strong support to the initiative (52 per cent). In contrast to younger people, they could rather hope to benefit form this middle‐term partial solution for the AHV. A majority of voters with a lower income belonged to the proponents, too. For those people, the future condition of the old‐age and survivors' pension scheme is a question of existence. Unlike richer people, they could not count on private financial precautions (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic &amp; Scheuss 2006</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The ballot of 24 September 2006 was a bitter defeat for the left. Two months later, at the next two referenda on 26 November, the wind changed. The first referendum concerned contributions to the new European Union (EU) Member States. In the context of the second package of bilateral negotiations, Switzerland and the EU have come to the agreement that Switzerland makes a contribution of one billion Swiss Francs to the new Eastern European EU Member States. These payments would constitute direct contributions by Switzerland to bilaterally agreed projects in Eastern European countries and are to be staggered over ten years. The bill was passed in the National Council (127:53) and in the Council of States (37:1).</p>
         
         <p>The referendum against the payment was engineered by the eurosceptical Swiss People's Party, supported by two smaller right‐wing parties. The supporters of the federal law on cooperation with the states of Eastern Europe were backed by a majority of the political parties and by large parts of Swiss business interest groups. Despite the supporters' dominance in Parliament, the referendum's outcome was not predictable at all. In the past, the resourceful Swiss People's Party had managed a couple of times to win a referendum in which they alone were against a proposal. And, as usual on questions of European integration, it really was a close race: only 53.4 per cent of voters and 15 cantons approved the new Federal law on Eastern Europe. While the cantons of more Europhile western Switzerland and the urban regions of the German‐speaking part of Switzerland backed the bill, rural regions in the central and eastern parts opposed it strongly. The decision in favour or against the payment was primarily determined by partisan orientations. The Swiss People's Party could count on strong voter discipline in its ranks: as the post‐vote VOX Analysis reveals (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2006</a></span>), 90 per cent of its partisans dismissed the bill. Just as loyal, but in the opposite camp, were the Social Democrat sympathisers, who voted in favour of the bill at a rate of 86 per cent. In addition, trust in government was important: lack of trust led to a negative attitude towards the federal law on cooperation with the states of Eastern Europe.
         </p>
         
         <p>For a large proportion of voters, their decision for or against the payment was made early. However, because things were so close, the pro‐campaign (primarily mounted by the Swiss economic associations) was effective: the later a voter made their decision, the more likely they were to accept the proposal. In the run‐up to the ballot, the media carried explicit statements from EU representatives concerning the economic and political consequences for Switzerland should the ‘no’ camp emerge victorious. Interestingly, an altruistic desire to reduce poverty in Eastern Europe seems to have been more important to the ‘yes’ vote than economic self‐interest, although many believed that Swiss enterprises might be discriminated against in the wake of a ‘no’ vote. This risk was considered much lower by those voting ‘no’, many of whom saw the contributions as something akin to extortion and a drain on resources that should be used to tackle poverty at home (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2006</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In the eyes of the voters, however, it was the second referendum that was more important (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2006</a></span>). In it they had to decide on the Federal Child Benefit Act, which prescribes national minimum levels for child benefit and support for adolescents in vocational training, and establishes uniform qualification conditions. This harmonisation implied an increase of family allowances in the majority of cantons and a remarkable increase in the private sector's contribution. Consequently, the Swiss Trade Association launched a referendum against the Act. They were backed by the Swiss Employers' Association, the Swiss Peoples' Party and the Radical Free Democrats (FDP). First, they complained of additional costs on the employer's side. Second, they criticised the principle of giving everybody (including rich and foreign families) an equal share. And third, the opponents perceived the act as a loss of federalism. The Act was supported by the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Greens, and the trade unions. They highlighted the fairness of a national solution that includes a binding minimum.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the end, the bill's proponents prevailed. A clear majority of 68 per cent approved the Federal Child Benefit Act and all but one canton endorsed it. The voters' socio‐economic characteristics had only a marginal impact on their decision, whereas left‐right orientation and party affiliation were more important. Left‐wing partisans demonstrated the most loyalty, with some 84 per cent toeing the party line. In contrast, the opponents had too many dissenters in their ranks: almost every second partisan of the Swiss People Party (42 per cent) voted for the Act, while the partisans of the Radical Free Democrats (67 per cent of whom backed the Act) left their party out in the rain (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2006</a></span>). Surveys suggest that the harmonisation brought in by the Act was more important than the increases it mandated.
