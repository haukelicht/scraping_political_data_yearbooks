         <p>The change in political climate manifested by the local elections in May was confirmed and even moved on by the result of four referenda held in June. These referenda called for the abrogation of two new rules regulating the privatisation of public goods at the local level (particularly the supply of water), of nuclear power plants and of the law which allowed the Prime Minister and other ministers of government not to appear in court (or, better, delaying <i>ad infinitum</i> their appearance) in a trial concerning themselves.
         </p>
         
         <p>The topics touched upon different questions and were promoted by different groups. The first three had civic associations at their heart. Committees for the defence of public delivery of water had already been active for a couple of years when a new bill was passed by the Berlusconi IV government to regulate the water supply privatisation. The same occurred for the new bill on nuclear energy. The fourth referendum was directly launched by the IdV (Italy of Values) Party. This party and to a lesser extent the SEL (Left, Ecology and Freedom) Party were very vocal, thereby ensuring the collection of the 500,000 signatures validated by a notary or a public official that is required to call a referendum. The PD (Democratic Party) had a contradictory position on the privatisation of public goods; it has not opposed the government bill in parliament: only in the last weeks of the electoral campaign, did it choose a clear pro‐aborgationist position. On the nuclear plants, the PD was in accordance with the promoters, even if it has always had an internal ‘pro‐nuke wing’. And on the fourth issue, and by far the most politically salient referendum with a clear anti‐Berlusconi connotation, the party was whole‐heartedly in favour. The centre‐right opposed all the referenda and advocated a sort of ‘opting out’ formula by suggesting their voters not go to the polls in order to lower the turnout below the 50 per cent minimum threshold under which the outcome of the referendum is not valid. This strategy did not pay off since the turnout was 55.6 per cent and the pro‐abrogationists obtained 94–95 per cent of the vote. Such a landslide victory reinforced the anti‐government climate expressed in the local election the month before. PD party leader Pierluigi Bersani called for the government to resign, but the centre‐right coalition proved strong enough to counteract both the opposition's external pressure and the parliamentary confrontation.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy18-sec-0003"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy18-sec-0003-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In 2011 Italy celebrated the 150th anniversary of its foundation. This anniversary was not unanimously embraced as a celebration. There were many concerns in the preceding months about how citizens would react to the events connected with the anniversary for two main reasons: the fear of apathy and disinterest of public opinion, possibly disaffected by the rhetoric of the events; and the vocal opposition to this (occasion of) recovering of national identity by the Lega Nord (Northern League), the regionalist and sweepingly separatist movement that, at the verge of the year 2011, was at its political height. A sign of this lack of enthusiasm came from the industrialists' association (Confindustria), which openly opposed the proposal of proclaiming a public holiday on 9 March, the day of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. In the end, the government, under the direct impulse of the President of the Republic, who was deeply involved in all the celebrations, introduced the new festivity but it was confined to 2011 only. However, the mere fact that there was a debate on (and even opposition to) officially celebrating the date of such an important event demonstrated how weak the national sentiment in Italy is, even, and especially, among the establishment.</p>
         
         <p>Despite this negativity, the numerous public events all over the country were greeted with massive and enthusiastic participation. The long series of public manifestations and cultural events (quite impressive in their richness, variety and cultural relevance) were those organised in Turin, the first capital of the Kingdom and cradle of the new country) were not only overcrowded, but revealed a sort of renewed national sense of belonging. For example, for the first time since the football world championship Italian flags were displayed in windows and on balconies – again especially in Turin where entire buildings were almost covered by the <i>Tricolore</i> (red, white and green).
         </p>
         
         <p>The major political event of the year was the fall of the Berlusconi IV government in the autumn following a year‐long erosion of its political support. Alongside and partly accelerating the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi on 12 November were the local elections in May, the national referenda in June, the one million signatures for a new electoral law in October, the sex scandal affecting Mr Berlusconi from the beginning of the year, and the bad management of the economic crisis.</p>
         
         <p>Local mayoral elections were held in May in most of the major Italian cities: Milan, Turin, Naples, Cagliari, Trieste and Bologna to name the most important ones. Even before the results of the polls the candidate selection was revealing of the political climate. The centre‐left held open primaries among all its voters (all citizens above 16 years of age signing a document and donating one euro could participate) with a wide selection of candidatures coming from the various parties and from civil society. The centre‐right parties, on the other hand, proceeded with the traditional top‐down decision‐making process. A further issue concerned the alliances. The centre‐left (i.e., PD, SEL and IdV) presented a common candidate, selected through primaries, in many cities. On some occasions, a SEL candidate stood against the PD; in other cities, however, the PD turned toward the centre and formed an alliance with the moderate catholic UDC (Union of Centre), leaving aside the other leftist parties. The centre‐right – Berlusconi's PdL (People of Freedom) and Bossi's Lega Nord – competed almost everywhere together, and in some cities they made an alliance with the UDC.</p>
         
         <p>The process of candidate selection through open primaries produced unexpected resultss on the centre‐left. Milan, the most important city under contest, offered the greatest surprise. The PD candidate, well‐known architect Stefano Boeri, stood against the former President of the Constitutional Court, Valerio Onida and Giuliano Pisapia, a well‐known lawyer and former MP for the radical Ridonazione Comunista. Onida was supported by a large network of liberal associations, while Pisapia was supported by a peculiar combination of social movements, liberal bourgeoisie and even a Catholic think tank. To general surprise, the primaries were won by Pisapia, and even more surprisingly the PD did not defect (against a common standard of behaviour) but loyally supported the outsider candidate, with the defeated PD candidate Boeri on the front line in the mayoral campaign. This peculiar setting contributed to the victory of Pisapia in Berlusconi's heartland (Milan had been run by Berlusconi's party and mayors since the mid‐1990s with overwhelming majorities). The centre‐left victory in Milan had a strong impact at national level. It demonstrated that the Berlusconi era was on the way out.</p>
         
         <p>If the PdL and its leader were losing touch with their traditional voters and especially with the northern bourgeoisie, the PD too had its worries. It confirmed itself as the first party of the centre‐left (except in Naples, see below) and in most of the 13 largest cities it had become the leading party overall, but these positive results left a bitter aftertaste because of the outcomes of the primaries. In fact, not only in Milan but also in another four of the 13 largest cities, the PD candidate was defeated by a more leftist candidate in the primaries. In particular, the result of the Naples primary – and then election – was striking. The primary ended in violent bickering between the various PD candidates, with accusations of fraud and various malpractices. As a result, the primary was invalidated by the party headquarters, which imposed a new candidate. This paved the way for an outsider: the outspoken former magistrate Luigi De Magistris, an uneasy member of Antonio Di Pietro's IdV. After having passed the first round, De Magistris won the second ballot against the centre‐right candidate with a landslide vote of 65 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>In sum, the local elections highlighted three aspects: the loss of support for the PdL, not compensated for by a corresponding increase by its ally, the Lega Nord; the good outcome for PD in the north after a period of exile, but its difficulty in winning the primaries with its own candidates; and the failure of the moderate Catholic party UDC to acquire a pivotal role. Somewhat related to this latter point was the emergence of a new political actor, the MoVimento 5 Stelle (5 Stars MoVement, M5S). The M5S, created by the showman Beppe Grillo, presents a new politics <i>and</i> (virulent) anti‐establishment agenda and operates almost exclusively through the Internet and Meetup.
         </p> 
         <p>The outcome of the local elections and referenda moved the PdL to make some changes in order to keep tight its parliamentary faction and/or re‐launch the party. In the parliament it created nine more under‐secretaries and a new minister in order to compensate some party sub‐leaders and some flanking independents (some of whom had saved the government in the no‐confidence vote in December 2010). Inside the party, at the National Council on 1 July, a new official position was created out of the blue – that of party secretary – and the young Minister of Justice, Angelino Alfano, was installed in the post by plebiscite. By so doing, Berlusconi meant to rejuvenate the party image, but it became immediately apparent that Alfano had neither the capacity nor the possibility to become an effective party leader. Berlusconi remained the only, uncontested, leader.</p>
         
         <p>The opposition's inability to force Berlusconi to resign – notwithstanding the continuous revelations of his sex affairs with escorts, and probably with under‐age girls, and of questionable political‐financial‐economic relationships with improbable tycoons and ‘<i>brasseurs d'affaires</i>’ – was surrogated by the deepening of the economic crisis. On 14 July, the government passed a new series of economic provisions to redress the public deficit in order to stop the rapid fall of the Milan stock exchange and the increase in interest rates. However, that bill was not enough because most of the provisions would not become effective until 2013. Moreover, in a repeated row with his Economy Minister, Berlusconi indulged in transmitting an optimistic message on the economic situation, such as: ‘Restaurants and charter flights are full!’ Clearly the market was puzzled by the lack of agreement between the two most important government figures and by Berlusconi's amateurish comments.
         </p>
         
         <p>In August, the outgoing and incoming European Central Bank Presidents, Jean‐Claude Trichet and Mario Draghi, sent a very detailed letter to the Italian government urging new and immediate provisions to tackle the crisis. On 12 August, the government announced a new bill for €45 billion which would be approved a month later. However the European Commission and the European Council urged further measures. During the EU summit on 23 October, Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel exchanged an ironic smile referring to the Berlusconi government's capacity to fulfil the EU suggestions and requirements. That scene, more than any other, revealed the Italian government's low confidence and esteem in the international milieu. And that scene had a profound impact on Italian public opinion and the political arena. Within a couple of weeks some MPs quit the PdL and the government failed to pass its bills in parliament. Finally, on 8 November, PdL no longer held the majority of seats and the President of the Republic urged Berlusconi to resign immediately after the passage, with the consent of the opposition, of another important economic provision. President Napolitano nominated Life‐Senator Mario Monti – economist, former rector of the private (economic and business) University Bocconi and former EU Commissioner in charge of Internal Market and then Competition from 1995 to 2004 – with the clear intent of preparing Berlusconi's replacement. As soon as Berlusconi resigned on 12 November, with unusual rapidity, President Napolitano charged Monti to form a new government the very next day. Six days later, the Chamber passed a motion of confidence in the Monti government, with 556 in favour and 61 against.</p>

         <p>The new government had two unique and novel features. The first is that it is made of independent members, supposedly experts in their own field. For this reason, the average age is quite high (63 years, not counting the ministries without portfolio). Actually this aspect is not unique in recent Italian politics. The governments of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 1993 and Lamberto Dini in 1995 were both composed of independents. However, in those circumstances the parties that supported those governments suggested their own ‘independent’ members to be included in the cabinet. In this case, no party suggestion has been taken into account. This disregard is due to the exceptional situation of the economic crisis and to the low esteem in which political parties are held (according to some surveys: around 10 per cent approval); in other words, the parties no longer had the political strength to impose their will.</p>
         
         <p>The second novelty is the very large support accorded to the government. The two main parties, PD and PdL, plus the minor UDC agreed in an unaccounted coalition to sustain the government. Considering the high polarisation of Italian party politics in the last years, such an outcome – the so‐called ‘ABC coalition’ after the initials of the three party leaders – was particularly unforeseen. IdV and the Lega Nord would not participate in this ‘<i>union sacrée</i>’ and went into the opposition. Thus the government faced a bilateral opposition from the left (IdV) and from the right (Lega Nord).
         </p>
         
         <p>The new government immediately intervened with a bill aptly entitled ‘Save Italy’, which, alongside other provisions, deeply reformed the pension system. The radical economic reforms introduced by the Monti government were generally accepted since public opinion perceived both the seriousness of the crisis and the dedication of the government members to the ‘common good’. The low profile and sober style as well as the competence and seriousness of the government contrasted with its predecessor. The public seemed to appreciate this change, granting the government an almost 80 per cent approval rating (84 per cent for Prime Minister Monti).</p>
