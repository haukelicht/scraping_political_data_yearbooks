         <p>As a consequence of the general elections in November 2002 that brought about a landslide victory for the Christian Democratic Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and a disastrous result for its coalition partner, the right‐wing, populist Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) (see the Austria entry in the Political Data Yearbook 2002), the ÖVP was the pivotal actor in government formation. Numerically, it could form a majority government with any of the other parties in the coalition game. Nevertheless, it took 96 days before the new government was sworn in – the third longest period in Austrian history (after 129 days in 1963 and 123 days in 2000).</p>
         
         <p>After the elections, ÖVP chairman and Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel opened up ‘sounding‐out talks’ (not yet regarded as ‘coalition negotiations’) with all other parties. A coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) was advocated by important groups within both parties, by the neo‐corporatist ‘social partners’, by Federal President Thomas Klestil and by a significant proportion of the public. However, the SPÖ insisted that major decisions of the previous government be rescinded – in particular, student tuition and ambulance fees for treatment in hospitals and the purchase of interceptors. It also rejected major propositions of Schüssel’s new ‘reform programme’– in particular, plans to increase the early pension age, introduce co‐payments of patients for health services and participate fully in the Europan Union (EU) security policy, including a duty to assist other Member States in case of an attack from outside (this stood in contrast to the traditional neutrality of the country). The ÖVP‐SPÖ talks were characterised by a high degree of mutual distrust, especially on the part of the SPÖ, whose leaders still regarded Schüssel’s behaviour during the unsuccessful coalition negotiations in 1999/2000 as insincere and criticised the ‘arrogance’ of the ÖVP. When SPÖ chairman Alfred Gusenbauer showed his willingness to compromise and agreed with Schüssel on some reforms (e.g., the gradual increase of the early pension age), he was criticised internally for sacrificing core party values. In spite of a decision of the SPÖ party executive to take part in formal ‘coalition negotiations’, the ÖVP had doubts about the reliability of the SPÖ to join its reform project and started a new round of ‘sounding‐out talks’ with FPÖ and the Greens.</p>
         
         <p>The decision of the Green Party to participate in ‘sounding‐out talks’ with the ÖVP met internal resistance – in particular from the Viennese party organisation. The party had excluded a coalition with the ÖVP from its range of options before the elections, above all because of the ‘social coldness’ of the ÖVP and its restrictive immigration policy. The ‘dirty’ anti‐Green campaign of the ÖVP further hampered the prospects of a ‘black‐green’ coalition. After a second round of ‘sounding‐out talks’ with the ÖVP, the executive committee of the Green Party decided in February (by 21 to 8) to enter coalition negotiations with the ÖVP. The negotiators reached compromises on some questions (e.g., integration of immigrants), but they failed in other major ones – above all, budget, pension and university reform, and interceptors.</p>
         
         <p>A renewal of the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition seemed rather irrational given the recent implosion of the FPÖ and its responsibility for the breakdown of the former government. Yet, the new FPÖ party chairman, Herbert Haupt, continued to stress the high policy closeness between the two parties. He seemed ready to give way on almost all substantive issues, just to stay in government. At the end of January, the FPÖ supported a proposal of the ÖVP for the decision of a provisional budget (as no regular budget for 2003 could be passed the year before). This provisional budget made it theoretically possible for the (caretaker) government to govern until the end of the year without having to decide a new budget. Although the ÖVP leaders could not be sure whether Haupt really had full control over the party’s rank‐and‐file (especially over the Carinthian fraction under Governor Haider), the ÖVP could also put forward arguments in favour of a return of ‘black‐blue’: first, coalescing with a weakened FPÖ promised greater spoils of office compared to a coalition with a much stronger SPÖ; second, about one third of the ÖVP voters in the elections were former FPÖ voters and the ÖVP wanted to keep them on board; and third, a return of the FPÖ into opposition would ‘liberate’ the party to resume its strategy of irresponsible outbidding and would probably be the best way to allow it reassert itself (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Luther 2003</a></span>: 148).
         </p>
         
         <p>On 20 February, the ÖVP party executive decided to enter coalition negotiations with the FPÖ. The leaders of the two largest provincial party organisations and governors of Lower and Upper Austria voted against, the leader of the Tyrolean party and the president of the Chamber of Business abstained. The vote of the FPÖ parliamentary group in favour of entering coalition negotiations with the ÖVP was unanimous. The negotiations started on 24 February and were finished four days later. The coalition agreement was ratified by the ÖVP party executive unanimously (with only the governors of Lower and Upper Austria and the president of the Chamber of Business staying away). In the FPÖ party executive, two members, among them the leader of the Carinthian organisation and close adherent of Governor Haider, voted against (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Luther 2003</a></span>: 148–149). The new/old governing parties introduced the coalition agreement, which clearly carried the handwriting of the ÖVP, into Parliament, obviously to test the discipline of the FPÖ Members of Parliament. The public did not support the ‘black‐blue’ reunion: 72 per cent of the respondents in a survey stated that it was not the ‘best government’ for Austria (<i>Der Standard</i>, 5 March 2003).<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

The label ‘independent’ obviously refers to the Minister of Justice Dieter Böhmdorfer (in the past, some, though not all, ministers of justice have been recruited from among experts without direct party affiliation). Böhmdorfer was, however, second candidate of the FPÖ in the electoral district of Lower Austria in the elections to the national parliament of 1999 and top candidate in the same district in the elections of 2002. That is why he is counted among the FPÖ cabinet members here.

         <p>The change in power relations between ÖVP and FPÖ (during Cabinet Schüssel I both parties had equal size in Parliament, now the ÖVP was more than four times stronger than its coalition partner) necessitated a reshuffle in the ministerial composition of government. Finance Minister Grasser, a member of Chancellor Schüssel’s ‘competence team’ in the election campaign, received an ÖVP ticket (formally, he was labelled ‘independent’). In addition, the ÖVP nominated three new ministers. The new Ministry of Health and Women was to be led by Maria Rauch‐Kallat, who had been Federal Minister of Environmental Protection, Youth and Family from 1992 to 1994 and from 1994 to 1995 of Environmental Protection. In 1995 she moved to the general secretariat of the ÖVP, and, in 1998, became the chair of the Austrian Women’s Movement, a constituent organisation of the ÖVP. Between 1995 and 1999 and since 2001, she was also member of the first Chamber of Parliament (<i>Nationalrat</i>). The Minister for Agriculture and the Environment, Wilhelm Molterer, a close political friend of Chancellor Schüssel, took over the leadership of the ÖVP parliamentary group (the previous leader, Andreas Khol, was elected president of the <i>Nationalrat</i>). He was replaced by Josef Pröll, a nephew of the governor of Lower Austria. Pröll had made a typical career in the ÖVP: owner of a farm himself, he had first worked in the Chamber of Agriculture in Lower Austria. After a temporary job as assistant to an ÖVP member of the European Parliament, he worked as personal secretary of Agriculture Minister Molterer before he was elected director of the Farmer’s League, another constituent organisation of the ÖVP, in 2001. The third new face in the ÖVP government team was Günther Platter, who was appointed Minister for National Defence. From 1994 until 2000 he had a seat in the <i>Nationalrat</i>, before he joined the provincial government of Tyrol. It seems that the nominations of the latter two ministers served the specific purpose of integrating the governors of Lower Austria and Tyrol, who had both expressed their scepticism with respect to the prolongation of the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition.
         </p>
         
         <p>The FPÖ had to accept a drastic reduction of its ministerial responsibilities. The Ministry for Public Services and Sports, previously held by Vice‐Chancellor and former party chairperson Susanne Riess‐Passer, was abolished; both responsibilities were transferred to the Chancellery. In ‘exchange’, the new Vice‐Chancellor, Herbert Haupt, received responsibility for consumer protection, which was taken away from the Minister of Justice, Dieter Böhmdorfer, who had annoyed major (ÖVP‐near) bank managers with his investigations against interest arrangements. The new Infrastructure Minister, Hubert Gorbach, was, since 1992, FPÖ chairman in the province of Vorarlberg and, since 1993, a member (since 1999 Deputy Governor) of the provincial government (in a coalition with the ÖVP) responsible for street construction and water management. Contrary to many other leading FPÖ politicians, Gorbach had built up an image as a competent and serious man. After the events that finally led to the resignation of Vice‐Chancellor Riess‐Passer and to the breakdown of the first ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition in 2002, he resigned his position as deputy party chairman. Surprisingly, he reappeared as member of the FPÖ team in the ‘sounding‐out talks’ and coalition negotiations with the ÖVP.</p>
         
         <p>Both parties were assigned three state secretaries: the ÖVP one in the Ministry of Finance, one in Infrastructure and one in the Chancellery (responsible for arts and media), the FPÖ one in the Ministry of Health and two in the Ministry of Social Security (one responsible for sports, the other for women). The State Secretary for Women, Ursula Haubner, performed a special function in the coalition: sister of Jörg Haider, she was evidently selected to serve as a bridge to the incalculable governor of Carinthia in order to prevent him from destroying the coalition for a second time. Haubner had served as a member of the <i>Bundesrat</i>, the second Chamber of Parliament, between 1994 and 1996. In 1996, she had entered the provincial parliament of Upper Austria and became a member of the provincial government one year later, with responsibility for environmental protection, consumers and women.
         </p>
         
         <p>The doubts about whether the FPÖ was a stable coalition partner were confirmed during the next months. When it became known that the former FPÖ members of government, Vice‐Chancellor Riess‐Passer and Infrastructure Minister Mathias Reichhold, still received ministerial salaries and thereby damaged the anti‐‘privilege’ image of the party, Governor Jörg Haider threatened that the Carinthian Members of Parliament would split from the FPÖ if the relevant law were not changed immediately (however, the Carinthian MPs refused to follow Haider). Referring to wishes of the party’s rank‐and‐file and the majority of the provincial party chairmen, Haider time and again indicated his determination to return to party leadership. He asserted that the incumbent party chairman Haupt had promised to step down in autumn 2003. The conflict escalated in June when the party executive confirmed Haupt in his position until the next party congress in 2004.</p>
         
         <p>The capitulations of the FPÖ in the coalition weakened Haupt’s position. His demand to repeal the ambulance fee for treatment in hospitals was openly rejected by the ÖVP (only to be announced later on by the ÖVP Minister of Health). Then he failed to convince the ÖVP to stop the full privatisation of the steel company Voest (see <b>Issues in national politics</b>). Similarly, the FPÖ (like SPÖ and the Greens) demanded in vain that at least part of the tax reform due in 2005 should be advanced to 2004 in order to boost the economy. This demand was reinforced when it became clear that more than two‐thirds of the promised tax reduction for 2004, by which people with an annual income below a14,500 should pay no taxes at all, were eaten up by increases of oil and energy taxes. In all these cases, the ÖVP pointed to the coalition agreement, which did not back the FPÖ claims, and ignored the initiatives of its coalition partner. The dramatic losses of the FPÖ in the provincial elections at the end of September (see <b>Issues in national politics</b>), which were attributed by Haider to the neo‐liberal policies of Finance Minister Grasser, were the last straw.
         </p>
         
         <p>In October, Haider announced that he would not move to Vienna before the elections in his own province of Carinthia in March 2004, but at the same time demanded a change of the FPÖ government team. On 20 October, the reshuffle was carried out (the party executive and the provincial party leaders had not been informed before): Haupt was replaced as Vice‐Chancellor by Infrastructure Minister Gorbach. Formally, he retained his position as party chairman, but State Secretary Haubner, Haider’s sister, was set at his side as managing party chairman. Haider himself was nominated as chief FPÖ representative to negotiate a tax reform with Finance Minister Grasser (whom he had accused of ‘treason’ after his defection to Schüssel’s ‘competence team’ in 2002).</p>
         
         <p>Besides the internal troubles of the FPÖ, the government was throughout the year confronted with concentrated attacks by the opposition parties on Finance Minister Grasser, once the most popular Austrian politician. Grasser was accused of corruption and other abuses. The voluntary organisation that had designed his private webpage and was headed by members of his personal staff had received a175,000 from the Association of Austrian Industrialists (VÖI). Not only did the organisation pay neither income nor donation tax (one of which would have been due according to tax experts), Grasser also denied any impact on his independence as minister. The statement of the responsible finance office (which is subordinate to the Finance Ministry) that no tax was due in the matter was heavily criticised by the opposition parties and tax experts, who suspected political pressure. Remunerations Grasser had received for public lectures had gone, he claimed, to a social fund; however, the fund had not yet been founded. Grasser was blamed for being the minister who had the highest expenses for public relations of all ministers since 1945. (The SPÖ pointed out that in 2002 he had spent more money for self‐promotion than was in the hardship fund of the pension insurance company.) Contracts of the Finance Ministry for external expertise were made with personal friends of Grasser. Last but not least, he was accused of having intervened in the decision concerning new interceptors on behalf of a consortium (EADS) which had close ties to Magna, the company for which he had worked before he was appointed Finance Minister. While the opposition parties claimed that in other democracies a minister with such a record would have stepped down long ago, and even leading FPÖ politicians called for investigations in the ‘Grasser affair’, he reiterated that his slate was clean and that he was the victim of a ‘smear campaign’. Backed up by the ÖVP‐FPÖ majority in Parliament, he survived all votes of no confidence initiated by the opposition parties.</p>

         <p>The new government, as in the period before, aimed at substantive reforms. However, the former ambitious goal of a ‘zero deficit’, reached in 2001 (see Political Data Yearbook 2001), was given up with the argument of the rather poor business cycle. After a deficit of 0.6 per cent of the GDP in 2002, for 2003 a deficit of 1.3 per cent was envisaged. The European Commission expressed concerns about the strategy change, especially with regard to public debt, which had risen in 2002 to 67.8 per cent of the GDP, clearly above the Maastricht criterion of 60 per cent. Equally, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) criticised the departure from the course of budget consolidation.</p>
         
         <p>Government‐opposition relations continued to be characterised by strict competitiveness. The fact that the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition was returned despite the dramatic events that had led to its collapse in 2002 suggests that the two government parties constitute a ‘bloc’ and will hang together as long as they command a majority. However, in the first phase after government formation, the coalition ranks were not nearly as closed as in the first term (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller &amp; Fallend 2004</a></span>). The fact that this time the ÖVP was now four times stronger than its coalition partner proved critical with respect to the internal cohesion of government. It encouraged the ÖVP to take the clear lead in the government’s policies. The FPÖ, on the other hand, was more than once overrun by ÖVP initiatives and struggled to justify why it had entered government at all. From time to time, it even sided with the critics of government decisions that it had prepared together with the ÖVP.
         </p>
         
         <p>Similar to the first term, the government tried to engage in controversial and unpopular reforms early in the term and keep public discussion of the issues as short as possible (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller &amp; Fallend 2004</a></span>). The first months were dominated by a grave controversy about reform of the pension system. On 31 March (for good reason <i>after</i> the provincial elections in Lower Austria; see below), the government presented its proposal, containing significant cuts of future pensions for workers. The early pension age (now 61.5 years for men, 56.5 for women) was to be lifted gradually until it would reach the regular pension age (65 years for men, 60 for women) in 2010 (exceptions should be provided for heavy working men or women – those who had worked 45 or 40 years, respectively). Those who retired before the regular pension age would get 4.2 per cent less pension per year, up to a 15 per cent reduction at most. Until 2028, the income basis for the calculation of the pension amount was to be extended gradually from the best 15 years to the life cycle of 40 insurance years, and the percentage by which pensions are increased every year would be reduced from 2.00 to 1.78.
         </p>
         
         <p>The government proposal, which carried the mark of the ÖVP, caused broad negative reactions. Even the FPÖ demanded improvements (for heavy workers and women) and argued that the pension systems of other, allegedly ‘privileged’, groups (e.g., civil servants, railway workers, farmers) should be harmonised with the one for workers. FPÖ party chairman Haupt took up an idea of Carinthian Governor Haider and pleaded for a referendum on the issue. Provincial governors of the ÖVP, especially those facing elections in 2003 and 2004, criticised Chancellor Schüssel at the ÖVP party congress in Linz on 27 April, advising the government to develop more extensive transitional regulations (yet, Schüssel was re‐elected as party chairman by 94 per cent of the delegates). The SPÖ presented its own model, which likewise suggested raising the early pension age, though dependent on the development of the labour market. The ÖVP was accused of saving its own core groups (civil servants and farmers) by postponing harmonisation. Instead, the SPÖ wanted to harmonise the different systems immediately. Finally, the SPÖ advocated a ‘solidarity contribution’ by retired people enjoying higher pensions. The Greens also doubted whether the government’s speed was really necessary and condemned the negative effects of the suggested reforms for the poor and women.</p>
         
         <p>The interest organisations protested as well. The president of the ÖVP‐dominated Chamber of Business advised the government to slow down the speed of reform and refine the pension plans, with the final goal of a uniform pension system for all groups. The formally impartial, but actually SPÖ‐dominated, Trade Union Congress (ÖGB), which had a long tradition of cooperation with governments of diverse party compositions, organised workshop meetings to inform the workers about the reform plans and explore their willingness to strike. The presidents of both interest organisations suggested, in the spirit of ‘social partnership’ (which had been marginalised by the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition after 2000), the presentation of a draft for a new, uniform pension model by the end of September. When Chancellor Schüssel rejected the offer (arguing that the social partners had had enough time to work out a new pension model), the ÖGB executive committee decided unanimously (with the votes of the Christian trade unionists) to strike. The government declared that it would not give way to ‘pressure from the street’ and denounced the strikes as ‘political’ and thus illegitimate. The ÖGB denied that it intended to overthrow the government. The strike was considered a ‘defence strike’ against excessive interventions in workers’ rights.</p>
         
         <p>At the end of April, the government revised its plans: three years per child should be exempted from the calculation period, and pension reductions as a result of the longer calculation period were limited (to 3.5 per cent until 2007, 7 per cent until 2015 and 10 per cent until 2027). The opposition parties as well as experts complained that the plans still lacked a harmonisation of the different pension systems. Even in the FPÖ executive committee, five (of 21) members voted against the new draft, among them four provincial party leaders. The public debate intensified. On 6 May, the ÖGB organised the first strike with (according to the ÖGB) 500,000 participants, primarily affecting public traffic and secondary academic schools. After the strike, Federal President Thomas Klestil recommended postponing the reform and letting the social partners work out a new plan, but his plea was dismissed by the government. Thereupon, FPÖ chairman and Vice‐Chancellor Haupt (after having consulted the Carinthian Governor Haider) stabbed Chancellor Schüssel in the back and suggested that the president should chair a ‘roundtable’, assembling representatives of government, opposition, provincial governors and social partners. On 13 May, the ÖGB organised a large demonstration with (according to the ÖGB) 200,000 participants in Vienna. Two days later, the first roundtable took place in the Hofburg. Chancellor Schüssel reacted by summoning his own ‘roundtables’, though only with representatives of the social partners. Four such roundtables were held, but brought about no positive results. As a consequence, the ÖGB declared another strike day on 3 June – the biggest since 1945 – which was (according to the ÖGB) supported by 1 million people.</p>
         
         <p>Carinthian Governor Haider used the momentum and mobilised eight FPÖ members of the upper house of Parliament, the <i>Nationalrat</i>, who threatened to block the reform unless several amendments were introduced (particularly a compensation for pensions under a1,000 per month, the elimination of pension ‘privileges’ of politicians and of functionaries in social insurance companies and a constitutional provision regarding the harmonisation of the different pension systems). Moreover, the chairman of the trade union for public services (the second biggest and the only one with an ÖVP chairman) insisted on changes in favour of his clientele. After intensive negotiations with the FPÖ‘rebels’ and the ÖVP trade unionists, the reform was passed by the <i>Nationalrat</i> on 11 June. The ÖVP‐FPÖ majority was secured by the following measures: early pensions should be abolished gradually until 2014; people with pensions under a1,000 per month could apply to a hardship fund to get compensation (the fund, however, contained only a10 million for 2004, so, given that over 1 million people received a lower pension at this time, the compensation amounted to a1 per person per month); similar to the regulations for workers, the pension cuts for civil servants were limited to 10 per cent; concerning harmonisation, the government promised to draw up a law by the end of 2003. Chaos was complete when the FPÖ members of the lower house of Parliament, the <i>Bundesrat</i> (again mobilised by Haider), threatened to veto the bill (a veto of the <i>Bundesrat</i> can only delay a bill; the <i>Nationalrat</i> can enact the law by simply repeating its decision). Haider doubted the willingness of the ÖVP to consider his request for a referendum on the pension reform and to proceed with harmonisation. In fact, the FPÖ<i>Bundesrat</i> members disagreed both with the bill containing the pension reform and a resolution <i>not</i> to veto the bill. Hence, the enactment procedure was delayed for eight weeks, and the ÖVP was fuming about its coalition partner. Irritations were also caused in the ÖGB by the agreement of the chairman of the trade union for public services (an ÖVP MP) to the pension reform, which contradicted a unanimous decision of the ÖGB executive committee (in October, he was also elected chairman of the Workers’ and Employees’ League – a constituent organisation of the ÖVP).
         </p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP seemed determined to continue the pace of reform even when electoral punishment was to be expected. In summer, the government instructed the ÖIAG, the holding company of state‐owned shares in companies, to proceed with the full privatisation of the steel company Voest with its headquarters in Upper Austria – despite elections in the same province a few months later (see below). In contrast to the coalition programme and to a cabinet decision, the FPÖ demanded that the ÖIAG should keep 25 per cent of the 34.7 per cent of the shares it still owned. All the same, the ÖIAG decided to privatise Voest totally. The fact that 15 per cent of the shares were distributed as a convertible loan, so that the ÖIAG in fact remained a shareholder for another three years, may be interpreted as a small concession to the FPÖ. The FPÖ government members were disappointed, though; they warned the ÖVP that the FPÖ might leave the coalition, but Chancellor Schüssel remained steadfast. In mid‐September, the sale took place; as a result over 50 per cent of all Voest shares are now in Austrian hands.</p>
         
         <p>The next clash between government and ÖGB followed in the autumn, when the re‐structuring of the federal railway company (ÖBB) was on the agenda. The government plan was to transform the ÖBB into a (weak) holding company, sub‐divided into four stock corporations (two for infrastructure, one each for passengers and goods) and one personnel corporation, which would take over the 48,000 employees (most of them with permanent contracts) and lease them as required to the other sectors. The opposition parties suspected political motives behind the reform, aiming at splitting the ÖBB in order to weaken the strong position of the trade union. In addition, the government considered changing the official regulations of ÖBB employees, abolishing such ‘privileges’ as extraordinary protection against dismissals, automatic wage increases every two years and generous payments for overtime work and illness (on the other hand, railway employees have to pay higher contributions for pension and health insurance). The trade union denied the government the right to intervene by law into employee rights based on private agreements (however, the Constitutional Court ruled on 1 December that ‘in principle’ such interventions of the owner (i.e., the republic) are legal as long as they are not excessive).</p>
         
         <p>On 4 November, the ÖBB employees went on strike for 12 hours, affecting 700,000 passengers. After unsuccessful negotiations with the government, the railway trade union announced the start of an unlimited strike for 12 November. The opposition parties declared their solidarity with the strikers. The strike was concluded after 66 hours, after the government had agreed to postpone the reform of the official employee regulations for six months to enable negotiations between the ÖBB management and the trade union. The rest of the reform was passed by an ÖVP‐FPÖ majority of Parliament in December. The intensity of strikes in 2003 was uncommon by Austrian standards: in past years, striking days per employee often had to be measured in seconds. However, the effect of the strikes was limited: by and large the government implemented its reform plans in spite of the protests.</p>
         
         <p>Several laws of the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition after 2000 were annulled by the Constitutional Court in 2003. The most striking cases referred to the new regulations of pensions for surviving dependants in 2000 and the restructuring of the central social insurance institution in 2001. In the latter case, the Court decreed a violation of the principle of self‐administration (though the parliamentary majority is free to change the system from self‐administration to government administration). On the other hand, the Court confirmed the constitutionality of the pension reform in 2000 and the new statute for the public broadcasting corporation of 2001 (see the Austria entry in the Political Data Yearbook 2001).</p>
         
         <p>In June 2003, the environmental organisation Greenpeace started a people’s initiative for a ‘nuclear‐free Europe’, which would oblige government members to disagree to all EU decisions supporting atomic energy. The initiative achieved only 131,772 signatures (i.e., 2.23 per cent of the electorate). In the history of the thirty people’s initiatives since 1964, when the instrument was first applied, this initiative is ranked only 26th. The initiative, which has only consultative character, was introduced in the <i>Nationalrat</i> in September, but no decision was reached before the end of the year.
         </p>
         
         <p>As in prior years, general elections took place in several provinces (<i>Länder</i>) that were interpreted as tests for the popularity of the national ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition. On 30 March, the provincial parliament (<i>Landtag</i>) of Lower Austria, Austria’s biggest province, was elected. The province had been dominated by the ÖVP since 1945; however, the incumbent governor had time and again announced his preference for an ÖVP‐SPÖ coalition at the federal level. The election confirmed the general trend since the government change in 2000: the ÖVP gained 8.4 per cent of the votes (now 53.3 per cent) and with 31 seats (+4) for the first time after 1983 re‐conquered an absolute majority in parliament, while the FPÖ, haunted by internal strife, lost dramatically (−11.6 per cent of the votes to 5.5 per cent; of its original 9 seats, it was only able to maintain 2). The SPÖ, which had lost all elections since 1979, achieved moderate gains (33.6 per cent, or +3.2 per cent, and one additional seat, to 19). The Greens also gained; their share of the votes increased from 4.5 to 7.2 per cent, which meant doubling the number of their seats (to 4). In the provincial government, whose composition by constitutional provision follows the principle of proportional representation, the FPÖ had to cede its only seat to the ÖVP, which now has 6 seats compared to 3 seats of the SPÖ.
         </p>
         
         <p>The <i>Land</i> elections in the second half of 2003 showed a different pattern. In Upper Austria, in spite of the heavy legacy of the pension reform that had been decided by the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition in summer (see above), the ÖVP headed for a clear victory – until the national government announced its decision to privatise the remaining state‐owned assets of Voest. Voest had become one of the most successful European steel companies since the beginning of its privatisation in the mid‐1980s; this is why speculation spread in the media that Chancellor Schüssel might have deliberately set the date to privatise the company before the election day in order to weaken the governor, one of his major intra‐party critics (see <b>Cabinet report</b>). Of course, the SPÖ thankfully used the Voest decision in its campaign to point out the, as it was perceived, dogmatic, economically irrational policy of the ÖVP. A resolution of the <i>Landtag</i> to place 25 per cent of the assets in public (regional) hands was ignored by the ÖIAG.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the elections of 28 September, the ÖVP stagnated for the first time since the government change in 2000 (with 43.4 per cent, it won only +0.7 per cent of the votes), while the SPÖ (+11.3 per cent to 38.3 per cent) gained substantially and the Greens (+3.3 per cent, now 9.1 per cent) gained a bit. The ÖVP preserved its number of parliamentary seats (25), while the SPÖ won six (now 22) and the Greens two (now five). The FPÖ plummeted from 20.6 to 8.4 per cent of the votes and lost 8 of its 12 seats in parliament. The provincial government now consists of four ÖVP and four SPÖ members, plus one Green member. As in Lower Austria, the proportional composition is prescribed by the Constitution. Arithmetically, the Greens (as well as the FPÖ) would not have been represented in government. Yet, the ÖVP needed the support of another party to ensure the re‐election of its governor by parliament, so it signed a coalition agreement with the Greens, establishing the first such cooperation above the local level. In return, the Greens received a cabinet position with responsibility for environmental protection. The decision to enter a ‘black‐green’ coalition was contested among the Greens (only 22 of the 31 members of the strong party executive voted in favour). To be sure, a ‘red‐green’ coalition would not have been numerically viable in Upper Austria, but an ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition was explicitly rejected by the <i>Land</i>ÖVP. An ÖVP‐SPÖ coalition failed because of policy distances and the bad atmosphere caused by heavy attacks from the SPÖ during the campaign (the SPÖ party leader called his ÖVP counterpart Chancellor Schüssel’s ‘bedside rug’). Both provincial and national SPÖ politicians were disappointed by the ‘undemocratic’ behaviour of the ÖVP, which was accused of not respecting the will of the voters.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Voest case also had repercussions on the <i>Landtag</i> elections in Tyrol, which took place on the same day as the elections in Upper Austria. According to opinion polls, the ÖVP, chaired by the son‐in‐law of the legendary governor Eduard Wallnöfer (1963–1987), was about to win a clear absolute majority. Because of the Voest decision it gained only 2.7 per cent (now 49.9 per cent of the votes, 20 seats, i.e. +2). The FPÖ, as expected, lost considerably (−11.6 per cent, now 8.0 per cent, losing 5 of their 7 seats in parliament). The SPÖ won 25.9 per cent of the votes (+4.1 per cent) and 9 seats (+1). Their gains were overshadowed by the Greens (+7.6 per cent of the votes, now 15.6 per cent, and 5 instead of 3 seats). In spite of its absolute majority, the ÖVP invited the SPÖ to join a coalition government, because of ‘many impending problems’ and in order to prevent ‘obstruction’ by an opposition endowed with strong minority rights. The number of government portfolios was expanded from seven to eight, of which six were assigned to the ÖVP and two to the SPÖ. Although the national ÖVP leaders apparently would have preferred the ÖVP‐FPÖ option in Upper Austria, and although the ÖVP in Tyrol could have formed a one‐party government, the ÖVP leaders used both cases to underline the ‘openness’ of the ÖVP, which was the only party that simultaneously had coalitions with all other parties in various parts of the country (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller &amp; Fallend 2004</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>As in the year before (see the Austria entry in the Political Data Yearbook 2002), the problem of transit of trucks through the Alpine regions of Tyrol was on top of the agenda in Austria’s relations with the European Union. In 2003, the system of eco‐points and limited number of truck passages per year, which had been laid down in the transit treaty between Austria and the EU in 1992, was to come to an end. On 28 March, the EU Council of the Transport Ministers decided (by qualified majority, against the votes of Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy) that after 1 January 2004 those trucks with the lowest toxic emissions (so‐called ‘Euro 4’, with an estimated share of 23 per cent of the whole truck traffic in 2006) should be allowed to drive freely through Austria, while for more polluting trucks (Euro 2 and 3) the system of eco‐points should be maintained. The position of the European Parliament was even worse from the Austrian point of view: on 12 February it had decided (by a majority of 430 against 79 votes) to exempt not only Euro 4 trucks, but also Euro 3 trucks from eco‐points, with the consequence that in 2006 90 per cent of the trucks would be allowed to drive freely through Austria. On 26 November the conciliation committee between Council and Parliament opted for a position close to the one of the European Parliament, reserving a multiple of eco‐points than would be necessary for Euro 2 trucks. Council and Parliament confirmed the decision in December. The Austrian government announced its determination not to implement the EU decision and to introduce strict truck controls. It tried to hide the fact that only about 10 per cent of the truck traffic on national streets is due to transit, that Austrian trucks are not the most ecological ones and that Austrian transport ministers (pressured by the mighty freighter lobby) had let ten years elapse without being able to work out a solution for the transit problem that would conform to EU law and not discriminate against foreign trucks.</p>
