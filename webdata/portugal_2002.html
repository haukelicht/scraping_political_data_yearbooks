         <p>The PSD Government under the leadership of Manuel Durão Barroso continued a policy of austerity to roll back the budget deficit that had surpassed the ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP allowed by the stability and growth pact agreed by all the Member States in the eurozone. Finance Minister Manuela Ferreira introduced austerity policies in public spending, which led to major cuts. The overall result was a forecast 2.8 per cent budget deficit.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>In spite of protests by the trade unions, the Government froze the salaries of civil servants earning more than a1,000 per month, which affected about half a million persons, and only adjusted those below that to the rate of inflation. Other measures were the increase of certain indirect taxes and the selling off of public enterprises (<i>Expresso</i>, 25 January 2003). Moreover, local authorities were not allowed to resort to credit, and the National Health Service had to maintain tight austerity policies.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, the Ministry of Finance continued to struggle with the budget deficit. According to government figures, the budget deficit reached 2.9 per cent at the end of 2003. The main reason was a considerable deterioration of the economy in Portugal. Indeed, at the end of the year, the number of unemployed persons was increasing rapidly, creating problems for the overall estimates (<i>Expresso</i>, 27 December 2003). The year ended with negative growth for the economy.
         </p>
         
         <p>After developing measures to control the budget deficit, Durão Barroso focused on the reform of public administration. During 2003, several measures were undertaken to make public administration more efficient. The main thrust of public administration reform is the principles of new public management, which envisage a growing partnership between the public and private sectors in order to achieve more efficient delivery of services. One crucial aspect is naturally the modernization of services by reinforcing the evolution towards the information society. Funding from the European Union (EU) structural funds was reprogrammed to advance these policies. In addition, periodic evaluation and a more transparent competitive system of recruitment were to be introduced in the long term. Such reforms were opposed by the main trade union confederations due to the lack of dialogue and negotiation, and the nature of the reforms (<i>Expresso</i>, 22 February 2003, 21 June 2003, 28 June 2003). A further measure by the Government was to increase the fees in the university sector to a852, which led to major protests by students and university teachers.

         <p>Durão Barroso had to endure two major reshuffles of his Government during 2003. The first reshuffle happened in early April, when a newspaper reported that Isaltino Morais, Minister for Cities, Planning of the Territory and Environment had evaded paying taxes and had several Swiss bank accounts. Valente de Oliveira, the Minister of Public Works Transport and Housing, used the opportunity to resign as well, which he had wanted to do for a long time. Durão Barroso replaced them on 6 April 2003 with two personalities unknown in the political world. As Minister of Cities, Territorial Organization and Environment, he appointed Amilcar Theias, an experienced civil servant who was in charge of preparing the negotiations for accession to the EU and had experience with EU institutions. His appointment was regarded as important due to the fact that his ministry is in charge of allocating and implementing the structural funds. The Prime Minister appointed Antonio Carmona Rodrigues as the new Minister for Public Works, Transport and Housing. He also has a long career as a civil servant and was serving under the mayor of Lisbon, Santana Lopes, before he was appointed.</p>
         
         <p>In the first week of October, television channel SIC reported that the daughter of Foreign Minister Martins da Cruz got a university place to study medicine due to an exception being made for her. This led to his resignation. Indeed, there is a law that allows the children of diplomats to have access to university without having the necessary pre‐university marks. The problem was that when Martins da Cruz became Foreign Minister, he gave up his diplomatic career, so his daughter no longer qualified for this exception. Moreover, a family member of Martins da Cruz tried to change the law to make it legal, but this led to even greater protests from the opposition parties. It also led to the resignation of Pedro Lynce, the minister responsible for higher education, who had already threatened to resign before the summer because of cuts forced upon his ministry due to the Government's austerity policies. One week later, Martins da Cruz resigned as well, because his position was untenable. Durão Barroso appointed two women to the ministerial positions. For Minister of Foreign Affairs, he appointed the highly experienced Teresa Gouveia, who was Minister for Environment under the last Cavaco Silva Government, between 1993 and 1995. The new Minister for Science and Higher Education is Graca Carvalho, who is a senior civil servant in the ministry. The departure of Martins da Cruz was a major setback for Durão Barroso due to the fact that the two families are bound by a longstanding friendship. Martins da Cruz is tipped to replace Antonio Vitorino after his term as Commissioner in the European Commission comes to an end (<i>Expresso</i>, 4 October 2003, 11 October 2003).

         <p>The Socialist Party (PS), the main opposition party, was shattered by a major crisis when one of the senior members, Paulo Pedroso, was put under preventive custody in relation to his alleged involvement in a major pedophile ring scandal centering around Casa Pia, a charity dedicated to orphan and abandoned children. After tapping conversations between Paulo Pedroso and the PS parliamentary leader, António Costa, Judge Rui Teixeira put Paulo Pedroso under preventive custody in order to prevent him from obstructing justice by using high‐ranking contacts. PS leaders protested about the tapping of telephone conversations including those of leader Ferro Rodrigues. According to allegations from abused children, several people in high‐ranking positions in the television sector, politics and economic life were involved in a pedophile ring. Paulo Pedroso, the former employment and solidarity minister under the Guterres Government, was regarded as innocent until proven guilty by many high‐ranking socialist politicians, including his friend, party leader Ferro Rodrigues. Rodrigues had difficulties throughout the year due to the fact that his support of Paulo Pedroso led to strong criticism inside the party. The situation clearly undermined the image of the PS, allowing the PSD to improve its position in opinion polls throughout the year. By the autumn, the PSD was neck‐and‐neck with the PS in the opinion polls. Paulo Pedroso was set free in mid‐October, which led to a general positive assessment of the situation by the PS (<i>O Público</i>, 15 October 2003). The situation changed for the better in November and December when some of the allegations related to the Casa Pia affair were not backed by sufficient evidence. Ferro Rodrigues was able to strengthen his control of the party against his critics, particularly against João Soares, former mayor of Lisbon and son of Mario Soares.
         </p>
         
         <p>The People's Party (CDS‐PP), the junior coalition partner, celebrated their party conference in October 2003. It became clear that Manuel Monteiro, the main opponent of leader and Defence Minister Paulo Portas, decided to leave the party after the conference and create a new political party on the right called ‘New Democracy’. One of the senior leaders, António Lobo Xavier, proposed that the CDS‐PP and the PSD should merge, but the move was rejected by the majority of the party. Former leader Freitas do Amaral showed discomfort by comparing Paulo Portas with Stalin, due to the fact that he was able to get rid of the opposition inside the party. One of the invited guests at the party conference was Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the post‐fascist Italian National Alliance (<i>Expresso</i>, 22 March 2003, 4 October 2003). For Freitas do Amaral, this was an indication of the direction the CDS‐PP was heading.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Communist Party (PCP) continued to be characterised by factionalism. A Committee for the Promotion of Renewal inside the party, which consisted of 200 party members, was established to oppose the policies of the leadership. The consequence was a <i>de facto</i> expulsion of the members of the committee in July, creating further tensions inside the party. Furthermore, the PCP now has to deal with the resulting new party on the left, the Block of the Left (BE), which was conducting negotiations with other European Communist parties for the creation of a European party. The PCP opposed this move. The new European party would include the Italian Communist Refoundation and the French Communist Party. BE was very interested in joining it, hoping to bypass the PCP in the next European Parliament elections due in June 2004. At the end of the year, the negative economic situation in Portugal was affecting the Government in the opinion polls and the PS was gaining ground.
