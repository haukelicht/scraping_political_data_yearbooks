         <p>In 2016, the political establishment of Ireland arguably saw the greatest electoral shock since the foundation of the state. Though 2011 saw the collapse of support for the once dominant Fianna Fáil, in 2016 the three established parties (Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour) collectively won their lowest vote share in any general election. As a result of this tumult, the government was not elected by parliament until 70 days after the poll. Nevertheless, Enda Kenny made history by becoming the first Fine Gael leader to be re‐elected Taoiseach (prime minister). While parliamentary business slowed considerably under this new minority government, economic circumstances raised challenges including a significant increase in industrial unrest, severe problems in the housing market. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom's unexpected decision to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump in the United States were going to have an impact on Ireland's international relations. Despite these, strong economic growth was recorded, and unemployment fell to the lowest levels since the economic crash of 2007. It was probably also the year that we could mark as the start of a new boom.</p>

         <p>Dáil Éireann was dissolved on 3 February, almost going the full five years allowed for the parliamentary term. The parliamentary election took place on 26 February. There had been some speculation that an election would be called for the previous November, but Labour vetoed this. Though technically a Taoiseach can call an election when he or she wants, it was important for Fine Gael to maintain good relations between the parties as it hoped the election would centre on the possible government formation process. Fine Gael and Labour presented themselves to the public as a government seeking re‐election. With opinion polls showing a high level of fragmentation of support, Fine Gael and Labour claimed to offer stability compared to the potential chaos of an unknown and inchoate alternative coalition.</p>
         
         <p>The campaign went badly for the government parties as their central message, that the return of the government would offer stability, was challenged by poor performances from the party leadership. Public services and the economy dominated the campaign. Though the country had experienced strong economic growth, the opposition parties concentrated on the cutbacks to public services, promising to end austerity policies. The country was still experiencing budget deficits, making the government reluctant to match it with promises. In particular, the opposition parties committed to ending water charges for household water usage, introduced by the previous government. The charges were used to mobilise significant anti‐austerity protests in 2014 and 2015 (see Courtney &amp; O'Malley, <span><a href="#epdy12162-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12162-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>; 2016), and the government made changes to the charging regime in the face of significant non‐payments. The main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, had repositioned itself to the centre‐left and successfully painted the government as right‐wing. The expected uptick in support for the government parties never materialised.
         </p>
         
         <p>The election results were widely regarded as a disaster for the outgoing government (see Gallagher and Marsh (<span><a href="#epdy12162-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12162-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>) for a full treatment of the election). Fine Gael lost 27 seats in 2016 compared to 2011, an unexpectedly bad result (though the number of seats available was slightly reduced). But the junior coalition partner's result was more traumatic (even if it was expected) – Labour lost 30 seats. However, no party or parties clearly won the election. Fianna Fáil made a partial recovery though it is unlikely it will ever fully recover to become the dominant party it once was (Quinlan and Okolikj <span><a href="#epdy12162-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12162-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). Sinn Féin, other parties and independents made incremental gains. However, the increase in the total number of independents, under various banners including Independents 4 Change [sic] and the Independent Alliance signified the electorate's dissatisfaction with parties in general. If it was a change election, it was a change still in transition (O'Malley and Carty <span><a href="#epdy12162-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12162-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). Much of this dissatisfaction is driven by the perception that from 2011, the Fine Gael–Labour government merely implemented policies designed under the highly unpopular previous coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Greens. The particularly unpopular elements being the use of public funds for the repayment of banking debt, the introduction of property taxes and the attempted introduction of water charges for domestic consumption. This poor electoral performance for the government came despite very positive macroeconomic indicators including rising levels of exports and declining levels of unemployment.

         <p>The formation of the Kenny II government took longer than any other government in the history of the state. The combination of a fragmented Dáil, a large number of independents and a smaller than ever ‘largest’ party meant there was no clear winner of the election. Indeed it seemed unclear that anyone other than Fine Gael wanted to form a government. Much of the initial speculation was about there finally being a coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. For various reasons that was always unlikely (see O'Malley (<span><a href="#epdy12162-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12162-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>) for details).
         </p>
         
         <p>Both parties set about trying to attract the support of independents and smaller parties, though there was some suspicion that Fianna Fáil was not even trying. The first three attempts to formally elect a new Taoiseach failed, which meant that the outgoing government remained in office as a caretaker administration for far longer than was normal. Talks between Fine Gael and independents continued, but it was clear that Fine Gael needed to come to some arrangement with Fianna Fáil. The two parties met and Fianna Fáil agreed to ‘facilitate’ the formation of a minority government through its abstention on key votes. The deal the two parties published showed that Fianna Fáil wanted to extract key concessions on public sector pay and on water charges. The deal with Fianna Fáil, however, was not enough. Fine Gael still needed eight votes in its favour to have Kenny re‐elected as Taoiseach. Negotiations continued, and a fourth vote was scheduled for 6 May. Even while the debate was ongoing the members of the Independent Alliance (not formally a party, but it campaigns and behaves as a party in government) and Fine Gael were still negotiating and one member withdrew his support. Despite this the negotiators rushed into the chamber in time for the vote that elected Enda Kenny as Taoiseach. It was the first time a member of his party had been re‐elected Taoiseach following consecutive elections.</p>
         
         <p>Kenny had promised to have a gender balanced cabinet, but there were simply too few women elected to either his party or among the supporting Independents. His cabinet changes were minimal, probably designed with his retention as leader and the longevity of the government in mind. At its start few predicted that it could last for more than 18 months, and by the end of year it had already seen a number of crises and defeats on legislation. The government was unusual in quite how far short of a majority it was, and the fact that three full cabinet ministers were not of any party. They were, however, central to the government's delicate parliamentary balance.</p>

         <p>From the election to the end of the year just one TD officially switched allegiance. Stephen Donnelly returned to sitting as an independent after quitting the Social Democrats party and tripartite co‐leadership. The two remaining co‐leaders did not replace him in the position. Fianna Fáil returned 45 deputies following the election though its voting power was reduced to 44 when one of its TDs won the secret ballot for the position of Ceann Comhairle (speaker). This arrangement suited the new minority government which would need every available vote to implement its agenda.</p>
         
         <p>As a minority government dependent on opposition support to pass legislation it is hardly surprising that the government suffered a number of defeats in parliament or had to withdraw or amend legislation on the basis of what other parties wanted. This was unusual in Ireland. Both this and the fact that the Dáil lost many months of business on the election and the extended government formation process meant that 2016 saw the smallest number of acts passed since the foundation of the state.</p>

         <p>Stephen Donnelly left the Social Democrats in September 2016 and sat for the remainder of the year as an independent. Under the Social Democrats’ unique leadership structure he was one of three ‘co‐leaders’. The Social Democrats did not replace Donnelly in the leadership position as they had no other elected TDs.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12162-sec-0060-title"> Institutional change report</h2>
         
         <p>A number of significant institutional changes took effect in 2016. The number of seats in the lower house (Dáil Éireann) was reduced from 166 to 158. There was sufficient political will to reduce the number further but constitutional limits on the ratio of deputies to the population made such a move unfeasible. A penalty in the form of reduced public financing for parties was introduced where the parties failed to run at least 30 per cent female (or male) candidates. All parties met or exceeded the quota, though for some it did mean late additions to candidate tickets.</p>
         
         <p>Possibly the most significant set of institutional changes related to the power of the executive viz the Dáil (see Lynch et al. for an overview of the changes). The previous government had introduced rule changes that the new Ceann Comhairle would be elected by a secret ballot of TDs. Fine Gael allowed open nominations and two of its TDs competed against two other nominees. The election saw Seán Ó Fearghaíl of Fianna Fáil assume the office which promised to be a more significant one in part because the post was no longer in the gift of the government, but also because of institutional reforms strengthening the Oireachtas.</p>
         
         <p>The interim government agreed to the formation of a special committee on Dáil reform. This committee proposed significant changes to the Standing Orders of the Dáil. A new Business Committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle which significantly reduced the government's control of the parliamentary timetable and business. Additionally the chairmanships of the Oireachtas (parliamentary) committees is no longer in the gift of the government, but divided proportionally on the basis of seats in the Oireachtas.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12162-sec-0070-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Though the election and government formation dominated the political year, these were informed by a number of issues in Irish politics. Much of the opposition to the government in the years before the election was based on the austerity budgets and government cutbacks in public services and public pay. A number of public sector unions called for the restoration of pay cuts that had been imposed as a result of the economic crisis. There were strikes and threatened strikes in schools, the Garda Siochána (police force) and on buses in the autumn. The government was reluctant to make concessions on these for fear of encouraging further action among other key workers.</p>
         
         <p>One of the reasons for the increased pay demands was due to increasing rents, particularly in Dublin. The main issue facing the new government was housing. There had been an increase in homelessness, due in large part to the increased rents. The building sector had collapsed during the crash, and few new homes were built in the intervening period. This rigidity of the market could also be seen in that problems with bank lending also meant fewer could afford to buy their homes, putting more demand on the rental sector. The government's awareness of this as an issue was evident in the decision to rename one of the government departments to include housing in its brief. At the end of the year the government passed an act that introduced a form of rent control in some parts of the country.</p>
         
         <p>The British decision to exit the European Union had a major impact on Irish politics, because it was expected to have a major impact on Ireland. As the only country to share a land border with the United Kingdom – a border that itself was contested – and as a country with large cultural and economic ties with Britain, Brexit was to become a test of government competence. Immediately there were calls for a new government department and the main opposition parties claimed that the government's reaction was slow and ill‐prepared. The British decision put an emphasis on the border that had not really been there before and mainstream politicians were now talking openly about a united Ireland as a realistic prospect. The other international event to have an impact was the election of Donald Trump as US president. There were questions as to whether the government should meet with Trump in the traditional St Patrick's Day celebrations, but the bigger fears were for the potential impact of economic nationalism on US investment in the Irish economy.</p>
         
         <p>The autumn budget passed without much trouble. It was a budget which saw some increase in spending, including increases in key social welfare payments. The most controversial aspect was not directly part of the budget, but the decision to suspend water charges put some more pressure on the budgetary decisions. The suspension was something that was thought as a likely prelude to their abolition, though there was a debate about whether the EU legally requires Ireland to introduce charges for the supply of water.</p>
