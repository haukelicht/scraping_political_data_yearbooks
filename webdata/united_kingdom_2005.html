         <p>There were local government elections in England on 4 May 2006, with all London borough seats, a third of the metropolitan borough seats and a third of some shire district and unitary council seats up for election. The Conservatives made net gains in control of 11 councils and 316 seats, while Labour suffered a net loss of 17 councils and 319 seats. There was little net change for the Liberal Democrats, who gained only one council and two seats. These results have to be seen in the light of the fact that the seats fought in 2006 were last contested in 2002. The BBC national share of the vote projection (calculated using only wards with three‐party competition) put Labour again in third place on 26 per cent as in 2004. The Conservatives took a clear lead and achieved the psychologically important benchmark of 40 per cent (+2 since 2004), and the Liberal Democrats were down two from 2004 taking them to 27 per cent. As a test of the two new party leaders, Campbell and Cameron, it is clear that Cameron was the winner. The anti‐immigration British National Party (BNP) more than doubled its number of council seats in England from 20 to 44.</p>

         <p>It was a bad year for Labour, and especially Tony Blair, who was forced to announce a deadline for his departure. With a consistent lead in the polls over Labour from April, it was a good year for the Conservatives and their new leader, David Cameron, who moved the party to the centre and changed their image by emphasising concern for the environment. The Liberal Democrats elected a new leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, but failed to match their poll performance of mid‐2005. The issues foremost in the public mind were health, crime, immigration and terrorism.</p>
         
         <p>Since David Cameron became leader of the Conservative Party in December 2005, the polls started to record Tory leads, but on average the two parties were neck‐and‐neck until Labour's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worse on 26 April 2006 (dubbed Labour's ‘Black Wednesday’), when trouble hit three major cabinet ministers at once. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott admitted to having had an affair with one of his secretaries, the Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt was heckled by one of the least militant nurses' unions and the Home Secretary Charles Clarke revealed that the problem of releasing rather than deporting foreign prisoners escalated after he became aware of it. Not only did this contribute to a very poor result for Labour in the local elections, but the Tories averaged a fairly consistent 4.5 point lead for the rest of the year.</p>
         
         <p>The cabinet reshuffle on 5 May failed to solve the problems. John Prescott kept his salary and status as Deputy Prime Minister, but most of his department's responsibilities were transferred to the new Department of Communities and Local Government. Despite photographs of him playing croquet during working hours, accusations of favouritism to a Texan businessman, and colleagues declaring an interest in his job, Prescott survived the year. Following Clarke's resignation, the new Home Secretary, John Reid, described some parts of the Home Office as ‘not fit for purpose’ and tried to take control, but reports of problems continued (and eventually the Home Office was split in 2007). Not only did the third cabinet minister involved in ‘Black Wednesday’ remain in her job, but the Government, including both Blair and Brown, stood by their reorganisation of the National Health Service, despite continued criticism from the health service unions.</p>
         
         <p>It was an especially difficult year for Tony Blair, whose net approval rating (percentage satisfied minus percentage dissatisfied) in the polls dropped steadily from zero in the summer of 2005 to –41 in the middle of 2006, and then averaged –33 for the rest of the year. Although he announced, in October 2004, that he wished to serve a ‘full third term,’ and although a general election is not required until 2010, following the local elections Blair was forced to placate those Labour MPs applying pressure for him to leave by saying that he will allow time for the new leader to ‘bed in’. When he later suggested that he would not resign for two or three years, letters began to circulate among Labour MPs again, and on 7 September, Blair was forced to announce that he would step down by September 2007.</p>
         
         <p>Although the campaign was not explicitly orchestrated by Gordon Brown, he at least had the power to stop it and so came under attack from Blair supporters, with Charles Clarke describing Brown as a ‘control freak’ with ‘psychological problems’. However, without a strong alternative leader, criticism of the likely future prime minister was damaging for the party. There was no obvious mainstream alternative and it was unclear whether the left‐wing candidate, John McDonnell, would even receive enough support to run. While the events of the first week of September may look like a failed attempt to oust Blair, they succeeded in creating a clear deadline for Blair's departure without creating a substantial split in the party, leaving Brown highly likely to take over – albeit somewhat bruised by the process. The clear deadline for Blair's departure allowed Brown to reach an apparent rapprochement with Blair and speak more openly about his ambitions as would‐be leader. In his September party conference speech, he emphasised education, opportunity for all, community cohesion and power, active citizenship and voluntarism, individual responsibilities, British values and improved public services.</p>
         
         <p>Another problem for Tony Blair was the revelation in March that several of his nominees for peerages had both been turned down by the House of Lords Appointments Commission and were major lenders to the Labour Party. Unlike donations, loans on commercial terms did not need to be declared to the Electoral Commission and so avoid the public glare. Yet, while the Conservatives had published the extent of their loans, the Labour Party Treasurer, Chairman and the entire cabinet, apart from the Prime Minister, denied any knowledge of the loans. The police were called upon to determine whether honours had been offered in exchange for loans, and Tony Blair is now thought to be the first serving prime minister to have been interviewed by the police in conjunction with a criminal investigation, which continued into 2007. The long time scale and persistent media speculation only added to the difficulty for Blair. The cross‐party policy response was immediately to require that details of loans be published, but they failed to agree on a new framework for party funding in 2006, partly because the Conservatives pushed for a cap on individual donations that would severely restrict the revenue Labour receives from the unions.</p>
         
         <p>David Cameron had a good first year as leader of the Conservatives with local election gains and positive overtures, if not an endorsement, from Rupert Murdoch. Although the poll leads may have been mainly due to Labour's woes, Cameron had a clear strategy to change the individualist image of the party by apparently moving to the centre with announcements that the National Health Service was the top priority, tax cuts were unlikely and relative (not just absolute) poverty needed alleviating. The Tories also supported key planks of Government policy, such as the new opt‐out state pension scheme and the Education Act, the latter of which would not otherwise have passed due to the substantial Labour backbench rebellion. In an attempt to make the party appear more open and inclusive, Cameron downplayed immigration and Europe where the traditional party line was popular, receiving criticism from the right of the party.</p>
         
         <p>Perhaps the most striking part of the new Tory strategy was environmentalism. Although some of Cameron's publicity stunts backfired (such as cycling to work, but with a car carrying his effects following on behind), the Liberal Democrats put forward more radical environmental policy, and little sign in opinion polls of greater public concern, nonetheless the aim of changing the image, if not the policy substance, of the party had probably been achieved. The Government response to the issue was informed by the Stern Report on global warming, which was one of several expert reviews. Political commentator Steve Richards in the <i>Independent</i> newspaper (6 December) reflected that Gordon Brown seems to be particularly keen on such reports as they serve to add legitimacy to public policy at a time of widespread distrust of politicians.
         </p>
         
         <p>While David Cameron (born in 1966) emphasised his youth and branded Gordon Brown and Ken Livingstone as being ‘out of date’ and ‘ageing’, Sir Menzies Campbell (born in 1941) was beset by negative media discussion of his age, partly as a result of faltering parliamentary performances, as soon as he became the new leader of the Liberal Democrats at the beginning of March. Concerns about Charles Kennedy's leadership within the party gathered pace towards the end of 2005, forcing him to confirm his alcohol problem and resign. With a high profile as an expert critic of government foreign policy, Campbell was the frontrunner from the start, while other candidates for the leadership were either largely unknown or were distracted by discussion of their gay relationships. In contrast to previous policy of creating a 50 per cent top rate of income tax, Campbell proposed to reduce income tax and increase environmental taxes (such as raising road tax for the most polluting vehicles from £300 to £2,000) with little change to the total burden of taxation. Overall, it was a poor year for the Liberal Democrats since the party suffered net losses in the local elections and flat‐lined in the polls at around 19 per cent, below the low‐to‐mid‐twenties that the party consistently scored in the first half of 2005.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberal Democrats remained strong critics of anti‐terrorism legislation introduced following the 7 July 2005 suicide bombings in London. The start of the year saw parliamentary ping‐pong between the Lords and Commons until the Lords finally backed down and passed the Terrorism Act, including a provision making the ‘glorification’ of terrorist activity illegal and an extension of the period for which the police can hold people without trial from 14 to 28 days, but not the 90 days originally requested. On the same day the law came into force, a high court judge declared that the issuing of control orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 denied the recipients a fair hearing and thus a major part of the Government's anti‐terrorism legislation was declared to be incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1998. Tony Blair hinted at amending the Act, while David Cameron called for a ‘British’ Bill of Rights.</p>
         
         <p>The police came under increasing criticism following the failure of a major raid to find terrorist suspects and chemicals, but succeeded in foiling a plot to blow up aircraft with liquid explosives in hand luggage on 10 August. As with the 2005 suicide bombings, British‐born Muslims were involved, renewing attention on community relations. Some cabinet ministers publicly opposed the wearing of face‐covering veils (but not headscarves) as barriers to social interaction. However, Government proposals to make faith schools accept at least 25 per cent of their intake from other faiths were dropped after pressure from the Catholic Church.</p>
         
         <p>Debate continued on the extent to which the terrorist threat was the result of British participation in the Iraq War, and the relentless killing in Iraq prompted discussion as to whether British forces were helping or were part of the problem. At the end of the year, as the United States expanded its forces, plans were announced for the reduction of British troops in Iraq, but an increased presence in Afghanistan.</p>
         
         <p>The British and Irish governments' November deadline for the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland was missed, but there was still significant progress in the peace process. Although there were paramilitary shootings, riots and fire bombings, they were isolated occasions, and for the first time since 1970 no soldiers were deployed for the traditional 12 July unionist marches. The Independent Monitoring Commission said the IRA had ‘changed radically’, did not want to go back to violence, no longer had the capacity to mount a sustained campaign, and although members were still involved in crime, they were not acting with the authority of the organisation's leadership. To encourage the unionists to participate, the British Government pursued a policy of public spending ‘carrots’ and policy ‘sticks’, such as threatening abolition of grammar schools and further cross‐border policy making. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party became substantially more willing to consider joining a coalition with Republicans, provided they actively supported the police. At the end of 2006, the Sinn Féin executive called for a full party meeting to do just that. Meanwhile, the Union seemed to be under a renewed threat with the Scottish National Party taking and unprecedented lead in the Scottish polls.</p>

         <p>Changes to the composition of the House of Lords are summarised in <a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink">Table 2</a>. There were three by‐elections to the House of Commons in 2006, the net effect of which was to reduce the number of Labour MPs by one to the benefit of the Liberal Democrats. On 9 February, Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie became the MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, following the death of the Labour MP Rachel Squire. The 16‐point swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats was thought to be a particular embarrassment to Gordon Brown, who holds a neighbouring constituency. Another difficult by‐election for Labour saw the independent Dai Davies take the former Labour stronghold of Blaenau Gwent on 29 June. The previous MP, Peter Law, who died from cancer, was a Labour MP from 1992 and then a Labour Welsh Assembly Member from 1999, but resigned from the party in 2003 over the party's use of all‐women shortlists for candidate selection and won the 2005 general election as an independent. His wife won the by‐election for his seat in the Welsh Assembly. After the death from cancer of Eric Forth, another Conservative, Bob Neill, became the MP for Bromley and Chislehurst on 29 June, but the Tories suffered a 14‐point swing to the Liberal Democrats, while Labour were relegated to fourth place after the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

         <p>Following the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the post of the Lord Chancellor was narrowed to being the head of the Department of Constitutional Affairs. In April, the role as the head of the judiciary went to the Lord Chief Justice, and in June, Baroness Hayman was elected by members of the House of Lords to be the first Lord Speaker, taking over the presiding role of the Lord Chancellor. These moves increased the separation of powers since the Lord Chancellor was previously both head of the judiciary and a member of the executive. The post can now be filled by someone from either the Lords or the Commons.</p>
         
         <p>The Government of Wales Act 2006 gave, starting in 2007, the Welsh Assembly the power to write and pass legislation with parliamentary assent on a case‐by‐case basis granted by Orders in Council. Both Houses of Parliament and the Secretary of State for Wales have veto power over these transfer orders, but it is not clear how they will be scrutinised in Westminster. The Act also stops people standing as candidates in both a constituency and a region under the Additional Member (or MMM) system used for elections to the Welsh Assembly. There is also provision in the Act to further devolve primary lawmaking powers over twenty fields (including health, education, local government and agriculture) to the Assembly subject to a referendum in Wales called by the Secretary of State.</p>
         
         <p>In November, the House of Commons reformed its committee structure, establishing ‘bill committees’ with the power to take evidence from outside bodies before scrutinising the detail of legislation.</p>
