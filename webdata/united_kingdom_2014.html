         <p>Two major political events dominated politics in the United Kingdom in 2014. First, elections to the European Parliament were won by the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP); this was the first time a national election had been won by a party other than Labour or the Conservatives since 1910. Second, a referendum was held in Scotland on the question of whether it should become an independent country. While voters rejected independence, the result raised many questions about Scotland's future relationship with the United Kingdom, the answers to which were far from being resolved by the end of the year. Beyond these major events, coalition tensions were present as in previous years but this time over education, housing and communications data policies. In UK‐EU relations, the government was largely isolated in its attempts to prevent Jean‐Claude Juncker becoming President of the European Commission, and the government made changes to EU migrants’ access to social welfare benefits in an attempt to make the United Kingdom a less attractive destination for those from other EU countries. Two by‐elections saw UKIP gaining its first members of the House of Commons. The process of setting out policies ahead of the 2015 general election began with some announcements made by parties towards the end of 2014.</p>

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="epdy12111-sec-0030"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="epdy12111-sec-0030-title"> European Parliament elections</h3>
            
            <p>Prior to the beginning of the EP election campaign in the United Kingdom, there were – for the first time – two televised debates between two party leaders on the UK's membership of the EU. Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minster Nick Clegg took on UKIP's leader Nigel Farage, with Farage judged the winner on both occasions in opinion polls. For those that watched the debates, there was at least some exposure to discussion of the pros and cons of EU membership in the run up to the election campaign itself, contrary to the standard second‐order model of European elections. The debates seemed to have some positive effect on UKIP's position in polls of European election vote intention. However, they appeared to make little if any difference to voters’ positions on how they might vote in an in‐out EU referendum (YouGov/Sunday Times <span title=""><a href="#epdy12111-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12111-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>) or to support for the Liberal Democrats (the smaller of the two coalition partners), which was dwindling.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the campaign, discussion of the EU was framed partly in terms of whether the United Kingdom should be in or out. Labour and the Liberal Democrats campaigned strongly in favour of continued membership. The Conservatives suggested Britain should remain in the EU, but with a renegotiated settlement including some repatriation of powers and a stronger role for national parliaments. UKIP campaigned for the United Kingdom to leave the EU as soon as practicable. A major theme in the campaign was immigration. The Conservatives emphasised what they had done to try to make the UK a less attractive place for immigrants from within the EU by cutting access to out‐of‐work welfare benefits. They also set out an aim of restricting access for those coming from any countries joining the EU in future. UKIP's campaign posters took up the issue of immigration with one stating ‘26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?’ above a photograph of a pointing finger. They framed the issue in terms of losing control over the United Kingdom's borders and the threat to public services as a result of high levels of immigration. UKIP also made a case for the benefits they argued would flow from leaving, such as allowing the United Kingdom to cut and control immigration, reduced fuel poverty and less regulation of small businesses.</p>
            
            <p>The pro‐EU parties focused their efforts more on the economic benefits of membership. The Liberal Democrat manifesto gave prominence to the economic arguments for staying in, principally with reference to jobs, as well as what they saw as the benefits of membership for fighting cross‐border crime and protecting the environment. Labour also led its manifesto with discussion of jobs and growth in the EU, citing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership as a great opportunity for economic growth in the United Kingdom.</p>
            
            <p>Data from the British Election Study's survey in February–March 2014 (Fieldhouse et al. <span title=""><a href="#epdy12111-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12111-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>) suggested that for voters the most important issues in the run up to this election were the economy (33 per cent) and immigration (24 per cent), with many other issues being cited by fewer than 5 per cent of respondents. Although there was much discussion of whether the United Kingdom should continue to be an EU member, only 1 per cent of respondents cited Europe or the EU as the most important issue.
            </p>
            
            <p>Many of the opinion polls in the weeks before the election differed as to whether Labour or UKIP were ahead, suggesting the outcome would be close. In the event, UKIP won with just under a two point lead over Labour. This was UKIP's best ever performance in a European election. The Liberal Democrats were all but wiped out, finishing with just a single member and a drop of nearly seven points in vote share, leaving them in fifth place behind the Green Party. This was to be an indicator of the poor results for the Liberal Democrats in the following year's general election and demonstrated that UKIP had become a major force in UK politics.</p>

            <p>This cabinet took office on 19 May 2010 and is a coalition of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. In July 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron re‐shuffled the cabinet for the final session of the 2010–2015 parliamentary term. Among the major changes made, William Hague, who had been Foreign Secretary, stood down from this position, having also decided to leave Parliament after the 2015 election. He took on the role of Leader of the House of Commons for his final parliamentary session.</p>

         <p>There were five by‐elections during 2014 (Ayers &amp; Hawkins <span title=""><a href="#epdy12111-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12111-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>) – the most politically significant of which were those triggered by Conservative MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless defecting from the Conservative Party to UKIP. Both resigned as MPs in order to gain a fresh mandate under their new party affiliation. The other three by‐elections saw no change of party.

         <p>The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 permits life peers to resign as members of the House of Lords, something that was not previously possible. The Act also allows for the removal of peers from the upper house if they fail to attend during a session of Parliament (normally a period of around a year) or if they are convicted of a serious offence with a prison sentence of 12 months or longer.</p>
         
         <p>In March, the Labour Party altered the rules for electing its leader. In future, such elections will be based on a one‐member‐one‐vote system rather than on an electoral college that was used previously. This may have the effect of reducing the influence of trade unions (TUs) as previously all members of TUs affiliated to Labour were sent ballot papers for Labour leadership elections. For their vote to be valid, they had to tick a box affirming their support for Labour. Under the new rules, TU members will have to separately declare their support for Labour before they are sent a ballot paper (Collins <span title=""><a href="#epdy12111-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12111-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>).

         <p>A referendum was held in Scotland on 18 September on the question of whether Scotland should become an independent country. From January to early August 2014, many polls were giving the ‘no’ side a lead of between 10 and 20 points (Wells 2014). The ‘no’ campaign appeared to have been helped by arguments emerging from the Treasury about the difficulties of a currency union between an independent Scotland and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, a YouGov survey on 5 September, just two weeks before the referendum, was the first giving a lead to the ‘yes’ side. Another such lead appeared in a poll published just under a week later. Others gave very narrow leads for the ‘no’ side, suggesting the outcome would be very close. In the event, 55 per cent voted ‘no to independence’ on a turnout of 85 per cent which, unlike elections in the United Kingdom, was drawn from an electorate with a minimum voting age of 16 (rather than the normal 18).</p>
         
         <p>The size of the ‘yes’ vote led to some frantic attempts to find agreement among the major parties on a package of new powers to be offered to the Scottish parliament. The results of this were published in November 2014 in the form of the Smith Report. Among other things, it recommended giving greater permanence to the Scottish parliament, which could in theory be removed by an Act of Parliament at Westminster, devolving power over some welfare benefits to Scotland – including powers to create new benefits – and greater powers over income tax (Smith Commission 2014). Given the far‐reaching nature of these proposals, there was considerable debate over their implications for the devolution settlement in Wales and the question of devolution in England.</p>
         
         <p>In the realm of foreign policy, Parliament was recalled in September to allow a vote on whether the United Kingdom should contribute to air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq. MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking action. Earlier in September, Prime Minister David Cameron had announced plans to draw up legislation to allow confiscation of suspected terrorists’ passports at United Kingdom borders. This was in response to the numbers of British citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria apparently to act on behalf of Islamic State.</p>
         
         <p>Tensions were present between the coalition partners in May over spending on education when Conservative Education Secretary Michael Gove and his Liberal Democrat junior minister, David Laws, appeared to be locked in conflict. In October, Nick Clegg spoke of a ‘low point in coalition relations’ after the Conservative Home Secretary complained that lives had been put at risk as a result of the Liberal Democrats’ opposition to proposed legislation increasing the ability of the state to collect communications data. Nevertheless, this conflict must be seen in the light of the imminence of the general election, which was only seven months away.</p>
         
         <p>In UK‐EU relations, Cameron was isolated in his opposition to Jean‐Claude Juncker becoming President of the European Commission, with only the Hungarian Prime Minister also voting against the appointment. Amid increases in net migration to the United Kingdom, in February the government announced restrictions on access to benefits for EU migrants and, in the summer, reductions in the period of time for which certain benefits could be claimed by EU migrants in the absence of realistic job prospects.</p>
