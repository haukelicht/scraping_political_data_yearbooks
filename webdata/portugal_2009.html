            <p>After the super election year in 2009, the new Socialist minority government was under considerable pressure because of the continuing deteriorating economic situation. Although the economy was able to grow by 1.4 per cent in 2010, unemployment reached 11.1 per cent in the last quarter of the year. Moreover, the financial crisis was a further contributing factor to the stagnating Portuguese economy. The Greek sovereign debt crisis was another major problem with which the Government had to deal. Similarly to Spain and Ireland, Portugal was one of the countries at risk of debt default due to the dynamics created by the American rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and Standard and Poor's. The Greek sovereign debt crisis became a euro crisis and Portugal was one of the countries most exposed to the increase of interest rates in order to get additional funding from the markets.</p>
            
            <p>In spite of a radical package of austerity measures, the Government was more and more exposed to the criticisms of the opposition and the resistance of the population, particularly through the contestation of the major trade union confederations, the General Workers' Union (<i>União Geral dos Trabalhadores</i>, UGT) and the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (<i>Confederação Geral de Trabalhadores Portugueses</i>, CGTP) throughout the year. Within a year, the Government presented three Stability and Growth Pacts (<i>Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento</i>, PEC), each more radical in terms of austerity measures than the one before, which were negotiated with the European Commission and economic governance bodies in the Council of Ministers. The first SGP (PEC I) was presented by the Government in March 2010. Measures included the rise of taxation to 45 per cent for higher‐earning strata of the population, the raising of the retirement age for civil servants from 62 to 65, the freezing of wages and the reduction of the Civil Service by replacing just one in two retiring civil servants. The austerity measures were opposed by the two main trade union confederations, but supported by the main business organisation, the Confederation of Portuguese Industry (<i>Confederação da Industria Portuguesa</i>, CIP). One of the reasons for the urgency of the implementation of the new more radical SGP was that the official figure of the 2009 budget deficit was 9.3 per cent and the Government wanted to reduce it to 2.8 per cent in 2013.
            </p>
            
            <p>The relationship between the Government and the opposition had collapsed since the end of the previous year, in spite of the appeal by President Anibal Cavaco Silva to work together in the national interest. The best example was the approval of the budget for the year 2010 only on 12 March 2010 (normally in October–November of the previous year). Moreover, the budget was only approved with the votes of the Government due to abstentions from the two centre‐right parties, the Social Democratic Party (<i>Partido Socialdemocrata</i>, PSD) and the Democratic Social Centre (<i>Democratic Social Centre</i>, CDS‐PP), while the Communists and the left‐wing Bloc of the Left (<i>Bloco da Esquerda</i>, BE) voted against. On 26 March 2010, the main opposition party, PSD, elected a new leader, Pedro Passos Coelho, who was willing to cooperate with the Government as long as there was transparency in public finances. The role of President Cavaco Silva in bringing the two main parties together was quite important, particularly in view of the growing external pressure from the markets and the European and international institutions.
            </p>
            
            <p>On 29 March 2010, after an intensive discussion some days before, the SGP was approved by the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic. However, as early as 11 April, the European Commission asked for further austerity measures in order to reduce the budget deficit by a further 1 per cent in 2010 (<i>Expresso</i>,11 April 2010). A second SGP/PECII package of austerity measures had to be put together by the Socrates Government to respond to the demands of the European Commission. However, consensus on a further package of austerity measures between the two main parties, PS and PSD, was less and less viable. New PSD leader, Pedro Passos Coelho, was willing to support the Government, but also asked for a stronger input from his party in the way the package was put together. The new package included an increase in the Value Added Tax and further cuts in privileges and wages of civil servants in the public sector. The new package was approved by parliament on 11 June 2010 and signed by the President before 1 July when the new measures were to enter into force.
            </p>
            
            <p>However, after the summer holidays, a new further package of austerity measures had to be put together. The so‐called ‘PECIII’ was quite controversial because the main opposition party under leader Pedro Passos Coelho wanted neither to support a further such package, nor for his party to be associated with the policies of the Government. Indeed, the President of the Republic Cavaco Silva had to appeal to all political forces to achieve consensus in the negotiations of the new package of austerity measures in order to calm the markets and prevent a political crisis alongside the economic one. The discussion about an Irish bail‐out in the autumn put particular pressure on the Government and the main opposition party, PSD, to find a compromise on further cuts.</p>
            
            <p>Due to the euro crisis and the dire situation of Portuguese finances, the two main parties agreed on a further package of taxes and further cuts in the public sector, and the accumulation of pension and salaries was made impossible in the public sector. Moreover, taxes were raised and tax benefits cut. The new package of austerity measures was included in the 2011 budget. On 26 November the budget was approved in parliament just with the votes of the ruling Socialist Party. The conservative CDS‐PP, the Communists and the Bloc of the Left voted against. PSD facilitated its approval by abstaining in the vote. This reflected the general mood of a growing isolation of the Socialist minority government and the lack of support of the other parliamentary parties (<i>Jornal de Noticias</i>, 30 December 2010; <i>Expresso</i>, 26 November 2010).

            <p>After 22 years, the two main trade union confederations, the socialist UGT and the communist CGTP, joined forces once again to organise a general strike on 24 November 2010. The main reason for the strike was to protest against the austerity measures of the Government, tacitly supported by the main opposition party, PSD. According to the trade union confederations, about three million people took part in the general strike, while the Government estimated that just 28.35 per cent of civil servants took part. The Portuguese Confederation of Commerce and other employers' organisations also reported a low number of people taking part in the strike. The lack of support of the main trade union confederations was certainly a major blow for the Socialist government which needed broader support for the implementation of such a difficult austerity package (<i>Expresso</i>, 24 November 2010).

         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> The ‘Hidden Face’ case and the Socialist Government: Alleged accusations of trafficking influences and corruption</h3>
            
            <p>Since mid‐2009, the print media, particularly the newspaper <i>O Sol</i>, had reported on an alleged attempt of the ruling PS, including Prime Minister José Socrates, to control the more critical private television station TVI by encouraging its acquisition by Portugal Telecom. Allegedly the main goal was to buy TVI through the semi‐public Portugal Telecom and then control their reporters and reporting towards the Government. Allegedly Armando Vara and José Penedos, former active Socialist politicians and now managers in the private sector, were instrumental in establishing networks which tried to achieve this goal through trafficking influences and corruption. In particular, José Penedos and his son had allegedly supported the entrepreneur Manuel Godinho in the past, who controlled a large network of enterprises and allegedly used his power to help the Socialist government.
            </p>
            
            <p>In its 5 February edition, <i>O Sol</i> published an article with allegedly taped conversations between the persons involved. The conversations are about how to control the President of the Republic, Anibal Cavaco, and the purchase of TVI. Many of the conversations include offensive words against the President and the former leader of the opposition, Manuela Ferreira Leite. However, one major criticism of the investigative reporting of <i>O Sol</i> was that it failed to get the opinion of the people involved. It just presented one side of the story without the statements of the persons that allegedly conducted these conversations.
            </p>
            
            <p>The opposition parties decided to create a parliamentary committee of inquiry in order to find out about these allegations. This parliamentary investigation was done parallel to the judicial process that was taking place since 2009. For the ruling Socialist Party, the committee of inquiry was used primarily against Prime Minister José Socrates, who was accused by <i>O Sol</i> of being the central figure behind the plan. The committee of inquiry lasted until 18 June, but in the end was not able to find conclusive evidence in this respect. The political culture of the country, reflected in the relationship between the political parties and individual members of the committee of inquiry, was at an all‐time low. The committee of inquiry ended with members of the committee from the Bloc of the Left and the Socialist Party calling each other liars, and overrating or diminishing the findings of the final report. The report states that Prime Minister Socrates knew about the intention of Portugal Telecom to buy TVI when he spoke in the Assembly of the Republic on 24 June 2009, although then he said that he did not know about it. On the same day as the publication of the report, Socrates denied this interpretation by explaining that he just got his information from the newspapers and was not involved in any illicit activities. However, there was no conclusive proof presented to back up the claim that he was involved. The report was approved with the votes of the members of all opposition parties while seven members of the PS voted against (<i>O Publico</i>, 18 June 2010). At the end of the year, just the entrepreneur was in prison awaiting his trial, while Armando Vara and José Penedos resigned from their positions in business enterprises in the private sector (<i>Expresso</i>, 30 December 2010).

         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss5"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss5-title"> The change of leadership in the main opposition Social Democratic Party</h3>
            
            <p>After the catastrophic electoral results at the legislative and local elections of 2009, leader Manuela Ferreira Leite was under considerable pressure to resign. Four candidates emerged at the beginning of the year and submitted themselves to primaries within the party. The four candidates were the MEP Paulo Rangel, the president of the PSD parliamentary group José Pedro Aguiar Branco, the lawyer Castanheira Barros and the enterprise manager Pedro Passos Coelho. About 78,094 members cast their vote, and the final result was disclosed on 26 March 2010. According to figures from the PSD, 51,748 members took part in the primaries, which represented 66.2 per cent of all eligible voters. Pedro Passos Coelho was able to win with 61.06 per cent of the vote, Paulo Rangel got 34.47 per cent, José Pedro Aguiar Branco 3.61 per cent and Castanheira Barros 0.23 per cent (PSD, 31 March 2010: 5). Pedro Passos Coelho is the fourth leader to be elected in primaries, and at the same time, he is also the third leader to be elected since 2007 which reflects the difficulties of the PSD in finding a charismatic leader who was able to unite the factions inside the party. He was confirmed as leader in the 33<sup>rd</sup> party conference of 9–10 April in the seaside resort of Carcavelos.

            <p>By the second half of the year, political parties were already preparing their campaigns for the presidential elections which were to take place on 23 January 2011. Apart from President Anibal Cavaco Silva, supported by the centre‐right parties PSD and CDS‐PP, there were four other candidates on the left. The PS fielded the poet and parliamentarian Manuel Alegre as their candidate, even if the opinion polls were forecasting a defeat against the incumbent Cavaco Silva. He was also supported by the Bloc of the Left. The Communists selected the parliamentarian and former electrician Francisco Lopes as their candidate. Moreover, two more independent candidates took part in the presidential elections: the physician Fernando Nobre and the socialist MP Defensor Moura. In the last two weeks of December, the candidates started the campaign. At the end of December, the opinion polls foresaw a clear victory of more than 50 per cent for incumbent President Cavaco Silva and therefore a comfortable win in the first round.</p>
