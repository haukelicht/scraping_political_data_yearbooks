         <p>British politics in 2007 was marked by two turning points in the relative fortunes of the two major parties. The first half of the year saw a continuation of the Conservative lead in the polls that was established in April 2006. The resignation of Tony Blair and the start of Gordon Brown's premiership brought a revival of Labour's fortunes and nearly all the polls from the start of July showed a Labour lead. Speculation that the Prime Minister would call a general election mounted during the summer, but following a drop in Labour's opinion poll ratings during the Conservative Party conference at the start of October, Gordon Brown made clear that there would be no election after all. After this second turning point, support for the Government dropped sharply, such that by the end of the year the Conservatives had their largest lead over Labour since the mid‐1980s.</p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats' share of the vote in the opinion polls declined steadily to a low point at the start of October, when Sir Menzies Campbell resigned the leadership. The party picked up in the polls after that, but still ended the year four points lower than they were at the start of the year, and nine points down on their 2005 general election performance.</p>
         
         <p>It was a big year for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which each had elections to their devolved institutions, leading to restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland and nationalists forming the Scottish and (part of) the Welsh executives for the first time.</p>

         <p>Tony Blair started the year facing continued trouble from the loans for peerages enquiry established in response to suspicions that he or those purporting to be acting on his behalf had illegally promised appointment to the House of Lords in return for donations to the Labour Party. January saw the arrests of a key aide (Ruth Turner) and a key fundraiser (Lord Levy). After the second police interview with Tony Blair at the start of February, substantial sections of the press called for a prompt conclusion to the inquiry. Yet it was not until 20 April, more than a year after it started, that the police passed their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. It was not until July that the CPS announced that no one would be charged.</p>
         
         <p>Problems at the Home Office, which had caused major difficulties for the Government in 2006, continued to emerge. In January it was revealed that more than 300 convicted sex offenders had gone missing as a result of a legal loophole that had allowed them to register temporary addresses, and also that the fact that the Home Office had failed to pass on records of foreign crimes to local authorities. The latter became a test of the code of ministerial responsibility as a junior minister was forced to retract a claim of ignorance, but did not resign. There was also embarrassment when a judge suspended the sentence of a child pornography convict citing a letter from the Home Secretary and Lord Chancellor that courts should limit jail sentences only to the most dangerous offenders. These problems led to the splitting of the Home Office detailed in the <b>Institutional changes</b> section below.
         </p>
         
         <p>Having announced in September 2006 that he would resign within the year, Tony Blair made it clear in January 2007 that he would be staying until after the May elections. As May drew closer, it seemed increasingly inevitable that the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, would take over. There were some rumours of other candidates and some discussion of the future direction of the party, but no serious threat to Brown arose. Criticism of Brown within much of the Labour Party in this period was muted since it was in danger of being interpreted as an attack on his candidature for the leadership. So, while there was little complaint from Labour MPs at the time of Brown's last budget about the cost to people on low incomes of the removal of the 10p rate of income tax, the issue was to cause Brown problems later as prime minister.</p>
         
         <p>Brown's transition to the premiership also seems to have been aided by Blair pushing through difficult and controversial measures rather than leaving Brown to deal with them. As with the Education and Inspections Act 2006, the Government again had to rely on the votes of Conservative MPs, this time to renew the Trident nuclear defence system. Not only did 95 Labour MPs vote against this measure, but three government ministers resigned. There was also controversy as the budget for the Olympics rose to £9.3 billion, adoption agencies were required to accept gay couples as clients, and the Government announced that there would be no referendum on the European Union's Lisbon Treaty despite its similarity to the defunct European Constitution.</p>
         
         <p>In contrast to the Government's problems in Britain, there was major success for Blair with the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland. Although devolved government had been established and aborted twice since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, there was reason to believe that the restoration might be more long‐lasting because this time it involved the cooperation of Ian Paisley's previously anti‐agreement Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In addition, previously unresolved major points of contention had now been dealt with – most notably the decommissioning of Irish Republican Army (IRA) arms in 2005. Also in January 2007, Sinn Féin (the political wing of the Republican movement) declared its support for the Northern Ireland Police Service. Elections to the Stormont Assembly were held on 6 March to provide a renewed mandate, and the results further strengthened the dominance of the DUP in the unionist community and Sinn Féin among nationalists. Agreement was reached on 26 March and power sharing resumed on 8 May.</p>
         
         <p>The results of the local elections in England and the devolved elections in Scotland and Wales at the start of May were bad for Labour. They were forced out of government in Scotland after losing by just one seat to the Scottish National Party, which went on to form a minority administration. Although the party favours Scottish independence, its rise to power was not (contrary to claims from some quarters) such a great threat to the Acts of Union, which saw their (rather uncelebrated) 300th anniversary in 2007. The election result did, however, trigger the resignation of the leader of the Scottish Labour Party. Things also did not start well for the new leader, Wendy Alexander: although her election was uncontested, her campaign managed to fall foul of funding rules. In Wales, Labour lost its narrow majority and was nearly forced out of office, but after a long and convoluted series of negotiations, a coalition with the Welsh nationalists (Plaid Cymru) was finally formed in September. The BBC projected national share of the vote from the local election results in England put Labour on 27 per cent, marginally ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 26 per cent and well behind the Conservatives' 40 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>On 10 May Tony Blair announced his resignation as Labour leader and his intention to resign as Prime Minister on 27 June. The intervening time was not needed for a leadership election since Gordon Brown secured so many nominations from Labour MPs that no other candidate could achieve the fifty required to trigger a contest. There was, however, a lively competition for the deputy leadership, which was notable for its free debate and how left‐wing were many of the mooted policy proposals. In the end, Harriet Harman narrowly beat Alan Johnson.</p>
         
         <p>Although the Conservatives were well ahead of Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the local elections, their share of the vote was the same as in 2006 and their opinion poll rating also seemed to have levelled at around 40 per cent. Thus despite the Government's woes in the first half of 2007, there was little sign of the Conservatives making a major breakthrough. Tory policy announcements under Blair were few and often met with a mixed reception. When in the middle of May the Tories dropped their commitment to selective education on the grounds that it damaged social mobility, there was an explosive internal debate that led to a resignation from the shadow cabinet and raged for two weeks until the leadership performed something of a U‐turn. If this was, as the BBC's <i>Today</i> programme described it, a ‘key test’ for Cameron and his ‘Clause 4 moment’ (a reference to Blair's ditching of Labour's commitment to public ownership when he was a new opposition leader), then, in being forced by his party to permit the building of more grammar schools, Cameron clearly failed it.
         </p>
         
         <p>When Brown became Prime Minister he proclaimed that the ‘work of change’ should begin. One of his first major policy announcements was a range of constitutional changes that, in dispersing power, seemed to be designed to negate the controlling image he had acquired – in part by a former Cabinet Secretary saying that he operated with ‘Stalinist ruthlessness’. The new public persona was reinforced by the appointment of a variety of government ministers and advisors from outside the Labour Party, some previously associated with the Conservatives. Labour quickly regained the lead in the polls over the summer. Although there were various problems with attempted terrorist attacks in London, a burning car loaded with gas cylinders driven at the main terminal of Glasgow airport, floods, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and an illegal prison officers' strike, Brown appeared to respond to them relatively well. There were, however, some issues the new administration did not seem to handle well, such as sending out mixed messages on whether there was a change in approach to relations with the United States.</p>
         
         <p>There were inevitably some hangovers for Brown from policy decisions made under Blair. Some, such as increased violence in Iraq, were closely associated with Blair personally, but others could be linked directly to decisions that Brown had made as Chancellor. For instance, the collapse of Metronet (the company charged with maintaining the London Underground) was embarrassing for the new Prime Minister since this was an arrangement he had forced on an unwilling London Mayor. Similarly, the system for regulation of financial services instituted under Brown's stewardship was found wanting when, following the sub‐prime mortgage crisis in the United States, there was a run on the heavily leveraged Northern Rock bank triggered by its appeal to the Bank of England for an emergency loan. Despite assurances from the Government that the bank was not in trouble, the rush of customers to withdraw funds only stopped when the Government guaranteed all deposits held by the bank. The crisis damaged both the Government's reputation for competence and economic management and the public's expectations of the future health of the economy.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the various problems facing the Government, the speculation that mounted during the summer that there would be an autumn election heightened further during the Labour party conference in September. There were reports that the party was hiring staff and the unions had been put on alert, but Gordon Brown repeatedly avoided answering questions about whether there would be an election. Labour's lead in the polls quickly collapsed during the Conservative Party conference the following week, during which the Tories announced their intention to cut inheritance tax, postal workers announced a strike and Gordon Brown was accused of making a misleading statement about withdrawing troops from Iraq. While the polls during the Labour Party conference showed Labour leads of 7–13 points, the party had no lead at all in the average of the polls revealed on Friday, 5 October and Saturday, 6 October. Brown subsequently announced that that he would not be calling an election.</p>
         
         <p>With a good chance of losing seats and maybe even his majority in Parliament, calling an election nearly three years earlier than necessary might have looked at the time like a needlessly risky venture. However, the costs of not calling an election now appear to have been substantial. The Conservatives regained their lead in the polls and Labour's share of the vote dropped to the low 30s by the end of the year. It may be that the mistake was letting expectations of an election rise to such a fever pitch without following through. Certainly this contributed, along with the Government's handling of the Northern Rock crisis, to the impression that Brown was a ‘ditherer’, incapable of making important decisions in a timely manner. While it would have been possible to avoid raising false expectations of an election, there was a substantial section of the public at the time that thought that Brown should call an election because he had been appointed Prime Minister ‘unelected’. If this group is critical to understanding the collapse of Labour support after an election was ruled out, then Brown's choice effectively may have been between doing worse than Blair and so failing to secure an effective personal mandate in an immediate election or losing heavily in a couple of year's time.</p>
         
         <p>Another apparent casualty of the election fever was the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell. The share of the vote in the opinion polls for the Liberal Democrats dropped from just under 20 points when Blair was leader, to just above 10 points by the start of October. Campbell resigned on 15 October, triggering a leadership election in which the main candidates had very little policy difference between them. The argument was more about who would be better at presentation, and on 18 December the younger candidate, Nick Clegg (who was dubbed ‘Cameron‐lite’) narrowly defeated Chris Huhne. The party's poll rating picked up well under the interim leader, Vince Cable, who was commonly thought to have done a very good job, especially in pushing for the nationalisation of Northern Rock.</p>
         
         <p>The failure to find a private sector buyer for Northern Rock was just one of several of Labour's woes in the last few months of the year, which also included the loss of bank details and other personal data on all 25 million recipients of child benefit, public sector union threats of strikes and a police investigation into whether donations to candidates for the Labour deputy leadership had been given illegally via intermediaries. Meanwhile, the Conservatives made policy announcements on allowing parents to set up schools, local referendums on large council tax increases, home energy generation and carbon capture schemes, and they continued to push the popular cause of a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. The year ended with a consistent lead for the Conservatives in the polls.</p>
         
         <p>After the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland there was still further progress in the peace process, including the end of British military operations after 38 years, the standing down of a loyalist paramilitary group (the Ulster Freedom Fighters) and both the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association saying they were putting weapons beyond use. Nonetheless, significant tensions remained as the DUP continued to delay devolution of policing and a nationalist Assembly minister threatened to withhold money, previously pledged by the Secretary of State for deprived loyalist areas, because of the failure of loyalist paramilitaries to disarm. It was notable that politicians on both sides chose to postpone judgement when the Independent Monitoring Commission said that IRA members, or former members, may have been involved in the murder of Paul Quinn towards the end of 2007.</p>

         <p>There were two by‐elections in 2007, both on 19 July and both previous Labour seats, which were held by Labour. While the Ealing Southall by‐election was due to the death of the previous MP, the other was prompted by Tony Blair stepping down as MP for Sedgefield at the same time as he resigned the premiership. Although the Labour vote share fell from its 2005 levels, the results seemed to be more of an embarrassment to the Tories, seemingly affirming their inability to reach out to ethnic minorities or northerners. While not changing the composition of the Commons, the balance of the parties was altered when, as Brown became Prime Minister, the Conservative – Quentin Davies – defected to Labour.</p>

         <p>Following problems with the administration of the Home Office mentioned above and in <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fisher (2007</a></span>), the Home Office was split into two departments. A new Department for Justice was created on 9 May, incorporating the former Department for Constitutional Affairs and taking responsibility for prisons and the probation service from the old Home Office. The reformed Home Office is now more focused on security, including terrorism (a responsibility transferred from the Cabinet Office), immigration, policing, borders and identity cards. Judges have expressed concern that the absence of ring‐fenced money for courts within the Ministry for Justice raises a danger of pressure on the judiciary to take the cost of prison provision into account in their sentencing decisions. There were also some interesting developments in the process of policy formation and public consultation. In January, a citizens' jury was established to discuss data‐sharing, and in February a Downing Street Internet petition on road charging received over 1.8 million signatures.
