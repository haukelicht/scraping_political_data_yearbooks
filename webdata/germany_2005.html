         <p>While the previous year had been dominated entirely by the turmoil of an early election and an unusually difficult process of government formation, German politics in 2006 were rather unspectacular yet not altogether uncontroversial. To be sure, there were the ‘usual’ number of <i>Land</i> elections, but those were fought in <i>Länder</i> where no major shift of power was imminent. Furthermore, in times of a Grand Coalition, such shifts inevitably would include at least one of the governing parties on the national level and hence not weaken the Government's position in the <i>Bundesrat</i>. This meant that politics was driven largely by substantive controversies rather than tactical battles – and by the desire of the Grand Coalition to push through some major reforms at the beginning of its incumbency.
         </p>
         
         <p>The first move took many by surprise in that a Social Democratic Minister of Labour and Welfare is an unlikely candidate to push through a higher pension age, but it was essentially the former SPD leader Franz Müntefering who accomplished the first major reform of the new Government in February. This was followed by an agreement to raise a number of taxes including VAT by 2007 – arguably the most substantial tax rise in the history of postwar Germany. In any case, it was a clear indication of the rather desperate state of German public finance and the pressure generated by the recurrent failure to meet the Maastricht deficit requirements. Even though the 2006 budget stayed below the 3 per cent threshold for the first time in several years, the Government stood firm. In addition, pensioners were told that there would be no rise of their pensions in 2008. There was one significant departure from the Government's austerity course: maternity and paternity leave was changed so that it now provides more incentives for men to also take leave for child care, as well as there being more incentives to return to employment earlier.</p>
         
         <p>While these moves were fairly consensual between Christian and Social Democratic leaderships (if not within the Social Democratic Party), the debate over the reform of the system of public and private health insurance proved to be a major bone of contention within the coalition and dominated the public debate throughout much of 2006. The battle lines were not drawn always exactly between the coalition parties, but it is fair to say that Angela Merkel and her battalions within the CDU favoured a model that moved towards a flat rate (alleviated by a range of social correction measures) while the Social Democrats and the more pro‐welfare forces within CDU (and particularly the CSU) favoured a finance model with stronger redistributive effects. Clearly, this is a very shorthand (and inevitably simplistic) representation of a very complex debate. It is worth emphasising, however, that attempts to reduce health expenditure were relegated to a very second place by a cumbersome debate leading to a compromise implementing a very complex finance mechanism that will almost certainly be revisited after the next federal election when both of the Grand Coalition partners hope to be in a position to realise more of their original objectives.</p>
         
         <p>There were some major developments in German party politics in 2006. Most significantly, the primarily West German ‘The Electoral Alternative: The Party for Employment and Social Justice’ (WASG) and the Left Party.PDS, which had run successfully together for the 2005 <i>Bundestag</i> elections, agreed to from a unified party. To be sure, this was a difficult move for both partners in that two very different political traditions will be joined into one organisation. While the WASG is a protest party of disaffected trade unionists and Social Democrats who reject the welfare reforms of the former Red‐Green Government, the Left Party.PDS is a post‐communist party without significant success in the Western part of Germany. Given that they won 8.7 per cent of the popular vote in the 2005 <i>Bundestag</i> elections, this is likely to represent a significant challenge for the SPD which lost (again!) its party leader.
         </p>
         
         <p>Less than six months after he had taken over the chair of the SPD, party leader Matthias Platzeck resigned for health reasons and was succeeded by the Prime Minister of Rhineland‐Palatinate Kurt Beck. The new party leader put more emphasis on the SPD's social credentials, not least because powerful forces within the Christian Democrats (led by the North Rhine‐Westphalian Prime Minister Jürgen Rüttgers) were also beginning to emphasise a more traditional pro‐welfare orientation. Even though Rüttgers was heavily penalised for his challenging of Chancellor Merkel by the Christian Democratic Party Congress in November, this nevertheless highlights the uncomfortable strategic position of the SPD, which is now caught between an unambiguously pro‐welfare Left and a Christian Democratic Party having a credible pro‐welfare faction. Last but not least, former Foreign Secretary Joschka Fischer (and <i>de facto</i> leader of the Green Party) announced his departure from active politics in order to take up a visiting professorship at Princeton Univrsity.
         </p>
         
         <p>Other major events in 2006 included a strike by hospital doctors that lasted two months and eventually led to some concessions by employers regarding pay and the regulation of emergency services. A parliamentary commission of inquiry was formed, which will look into the tacit (or not so tacit) cooperation of German security agencies with American forces in the war on terror (including rendition flights). Significantly, Germany took another important (and surprisingly uncontroversial) step towards a ‘normal’ foreign policy when it was agreed that it would participate in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon in the autumn.</p>
         
         <p>Shortly before the football World Cup, it was only the technical ineptitude of the terrorists that prevented two commuter trains from being blown up. In other words, Germany escaped its ‘7/7’ by the blink of an eye. The World Cup itself was a considerable success for Germany's image. Not only did ‘Kaiser’ Franz Beckenbauer manage to organise almost perfect weather after several weeks of rain, the German squad played unexpectedly well – even though a successful penalty shoot‐out (this time against Argentina) can hardly count as a surprise.</p>

         <p>After difficult negotiations between the federation and the <i>Länder</i>, agreement was reached on a major revision of German federalism requiring a two‐thirds majority in the <i>Bundesrat</i> and the <i>Bundestag</i>. Its intention was to separate legislative responsibilities more clearly between the national and <i>Land</i> levels and hence reduce the proportion of <i>Bundestag</i> legislation also needing the approval of the <i>Bundesrat</i>. Thus far, about 60 per cent of all federal legislation required the consent of the <i>Bundesrat</i>, which effectively necessitated an informal Grand Coalition and substantially blurred the distinction between government and opposition in the German political process.
