         <p>In January 2005, a long anticipated change was realised in the government team of the FPÖ. Ursula Haubner, sister of the long‐time party chairman and ‘strong man’ in the FPÖ, Jörg Haider, who had been state secretary for women since 2003 and party chairwoman since July 2004 (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2005</a></span>: 948), replaced Herbert Haupt as Minister for Social Security, Generations and Consumer Protection. Officially, Haupt, who had already been pushed out of his positions as Vice Chancellor (in October 2003) and party chairman (in July 2004), gave up his position because of feeble health; but according to media reports he was forced to do so because of his unfavourable public image and in order to provide party chairwoman Haubner with better opportunities to present her party in public.
         </p>
         
         <p>Developments in the FPÖ were also responsible for the (formal) change of party composition of the cabinet in April 2005. The right‐wing, populist Freedom Party (<i>Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs</i>, FPÖ), which had joined forces with the liberal‐conservative Austrian People's Party (<i>Österreichische Volkspartei</i>, ÖVP) in a coalition government since February 2000, split as a consequence of a severe internal crisis. The government members as well as the majority of the FPÖ Members of Parliament left the party and formed a new one, the so‐called ‘Alliance for the Future of Austria’ (<i>Bündnis Zukunft Österreich</i>, BZÖ). The ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition, from then on, was officially replaced by an ÖVP‐BZÖ coalition.
         </p>
         
         <p>The major reason for the FPÖ split was that the spoils of government office were distributed unevenly between the two governing parties right from the beginning (cf. <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller &amp; Fallend 2004</a></span>: 818–821). While the ÖVP had won votes and seats in six of the nine provincial elections (viewed as tests for the national government and its policies) up to the beginning of 2005, the FPÖ, with one exception, had always lost votes, sometimes dramatically (e.g., −12.2 per cent in Upper Austria, −11.6 per cent in Lower Austria as well as in Tyrol, all in 2003, and −14.4 per cent in Vorarlberg in 2004). The only exception was the 2004 provincial election in Carinthia, where the incumbent governor, former FPÖ chairman Haider, was able to maintain the relative FPÖ majority and defend his position as government chief. The FPÖ had to pay a higher electoral price for many unpopular government decisions (such as the pension reform of 2003; see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2004</a></span>: 942–944) than the ÖVP, because it was obviously not able to represent the interests of the ‘small man from the street’ for whom it had promised to fight during its opposition years. Furthermore, the ÖVP (which, after all, was four times stronger than its coalition partner both in parliament and government) did not always care very much about the difficult situation of the FPÖ and from time to time took decisions without consulting or informing its coalition partner. For example, in January 2005, the ÖVP Minister of Defence unilaterally, against the declared will of the FPÖ, reduced military service from eight to six months. Although the FPÖ regarded the decision as a ‘breach of the coalition’ and threatened to take revenge, it had no alternative but to swallow it.
         </p>
         
         <p>As a result of the electoral setbacks and the secondary role of the FPÖ ministers in the cabinet, intra‐party criticism had risen constantly, in particular since the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, where the FPÖ had received only 6.3 per cent of the votes (a loss of 17.1 per cent) and lost four of its five seats. Most obviously, the representative of the traditional German‐national wing of the party, Andreas Mölzer, who had run as the candidate in the third place on the FPÖ list, ousted the official top candidate (a representative of the ‘pragmatic’ wing) by attracting more than twice as many preference votes and got the only seat the FPÖ was able to maintain. He and his followers blamed the cooperative and submissive politics of the party leadership towards its coalition partner, the ÖVP, and the neglect of its former anti‐European Union stance as the main reasons for the electoral defeat. As a consequence, the FPÖ party leadership was rebuilt; important positions (deputy party chairman, leader of the party academy) were assigned to critics of the party's ‘pragmatic’ course (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2005</a></span>: 945, 948−949).
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, in March 2005, the tensions reached a new climax. Haider recommended to the FPÖ leadership that they get rid of the ‘destructive forces’ in the party and re‐invent the FPÖ anew (that Haider now saw the ‘destructive forces’ in the critics of the FPÖ party leaders and of its government members seems ironic given the fact that it was above all his own criticism of the ‘pragmatic’ FPÖ government policies that brought down the Schüssel I cabinet in September 2002; see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2003</a></span>: 909–914). Nonetheless, the critics were removed from the party executive, and the party leadership announced an extraordinary party congress to agree on a new party programme as well as on an organisational reform that would strengthen the leadership <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the provincial organisations. Mölzer was supported by the chairmen of five of the nine provincial organisations; still he was excluded from the party (the result of the necessary vote in the party executive, requiring a two‐thirds majority, was controversial, though, adding fuel to the fire). The prospects that the party congress would sanction the plans of the leadership vanished further when the chairman of the Viennese party organisation (and declared follower of Mölzer) announced that he would run as a rival candidate to Haider for the party chairmanship.
         </p>
         
         <p>Thereupon, the pragmatically‐oriented leaders (including all government members and the vast majority of the parliamentary group) turned their backs on the FPÖ and founded the BZÖ in April 2005. Haider was designated chairman of the new party, which chose orange as its official colour (reminiscent of the ‘Orange Revolution’ in the Ukraine in 2004). The BZÖ programme did not differ substantially from that of the FPÖ, except maybe that the BZÖ demanded the introduction of a flat tax and a family‐based right to vote and supported European Union enlargement to include Bulgaria and Romania and the accession talks with Turkey. Mölzer and his associates denounced the new party as a simple wellness group, without content and ideological foundation. One cannot change one's party like a dirty shirt, they claimed, and predicted a short life for the new grouping.</p>
         
         <p>In fact, the members of the FPÖ's parliamentary group, as well as the provincial organisations, had trouble finding their correct new affiliation. At least two MPs refused to join the BZÖ (they declared their intention to support the government programme, however). Some of them joined the BZÖ, but remained members of the FPÖ organisations in their electoral districts. Because of the unclear affiliation of some of its members, the parliamentary group gave itself a new name (‘Freedomite Parliamentary Group’, <i>Freiheitlicher Parlamentsklub</i>), which included both FPÖ and BZÖ members. In the provinces, the FPÖ organisations split (BZÖ organisations were founded alongside); some of the FPÖ organisations wanted to stay within the ‘old’ FPÖ, while others declared their ‘independence’ from FPÖ headquarters. In particular, the question of which of the two parties should receive which sort of the state subsidies for parties (all in all over €5 million for the FPÖ in 2005) was controversial. Appeals were made to the courts, which did not decide on the matter immediately; however, provisionally, the BZÖ got the state subsidies for the parliamentary group, while the FPÖ maintained the money reserved for the party organisation and the party academy.
         </p>
         
         <p>In spite of the FPÖ cataclysm, Chancellor and ÖVP party chairman Wolfgang Schüssel tried to continue business as usual. He rated the FPÖ/BZÖ development as a ‘Mickey Mouse problem’ for his government, judged BZÖ leader Haider as a ‘constructive personality’ and rejected claims of the opposition parties, which questioned the legitimacy of the ‘new’ government and demanded new elections. As a matter of fact, the BZÖ government members and the MPs of the Freedomite Parliamentary Group (with two exceptions) pronounced that they would continue to support the coalition and its programme until the next regular election in 2006 in order to assure a professional organisation of the EU presidency, which Austria was to take over during the first half of 2006. As the government majority in the second chamber of parliament, the <i>Nationalrat</i>, was rather small (ÖVP and FPÖ/BZÖ commanded only 97 of its 183 members), the ÖVP leadership announced that it wanted all 18 members of the Freedomite Parliamentary Group to sign the coalition agreement anew. However, this plan had to be dropped after some of them refused to comply, pointing at the ‘free mandate’ guaranteed to MPs in the Austrian Constitution.
         </p>
         
         <p>During the following weeks, media coverage was full of ever‐changing calculations about how many members of the new parliamentary group now belonged to the BZÖ and how many to the FPÖ, or how many remained undecided (at the end of April 2005, 12 members were assigned to the BZÖ, 6 to the FPÖ). The FPÖ split also affected the composition of the upper house of parliament, the <i>Bundesrat</i>: until the split, 27 ÖVP and 5 FPÖ members disposed of a narrow majority there (32 of 62 members). Yet, as only one of the five FPÖ members declared himself to belong to the BZÖ (two stayed in the FPÖ and two declared themselves to be non‐affiliated), for the first time since 1987 the governing parties lost their majority in the house. Although this did not have dramatic consequences for the government‐opposition relationship as the upper house in almost all legislative matters only disposes of a suspensive veto, it was of symbolic value that the government had lost its majority (in fact, the opposition party even succeeded once in reaching a decision calling for new elections).
         </p>
         
         <p>The BZÖ plane did not take off, however. Right from the start the programmatic profile of the new party remained unclear and, according to opinion polls, it could only expect to attract 2–4 per cent of the electorate in a national contest, making it rather unlikely that it would be represented at all in the <i>Nationalrat</i> after the next general elections. The BZÖ was accused of being nothing more than a ‘stirrup holder’ (<i>Steigbügelhalter</i>) for the ÖVP. Shortly after the government ‘rebuilding’, 51 per cent of the respondents in a representative survey wished for new elections. Asked about their coalition preferences, only 10 per cent of them declared that they would support a ÖVP‐BZÖ government (while 38 per cent preferred an ÖVP‐SPÖ, 19 per cent an SPÖ‐Green and 12 per cent an ÖVP‐Green coalition; <i>Der Standard</i>, 13 May 2005). And the subordinate position of the BZÖ ministers in the coalition did not change after they replaced the label ‘FPÖ’. Contrary to demands of the BZÖ, the ÖVP had no intention to alter its European Union policy (and, e.g., to support its enlargement with Bulgaria and Romania) or its tax policy (refusing further tax reductions).
         </p>
         
         <p>When Haider, in the face of the poor prospects for his newest product in the coming general elections, suggested forming a ‘collective movement’ (<i>Sammelbewegung</i>) that would re‐unite BZÖ and FPÖ, the FPÖ leaders immediately refused the proposal by the man who in their eyes had betrayed the FPÖ voters by arbitrarily triggering the party split. As a consequence of the disastrous results of the BZÖ in the provincial elections in autumn 2005 (see <b>Issues in national politics</b>), Haider, not for the first time, announced his farewell from national politics to concentrate on Carinthia, the province where he was still Governor. Obviously, the idea behind this was also to try to ensure that the BZÖ would gain the desperately needed basic mandate, the threshold for representation in the <i>Nationalrat</i>, in an electoral district of ‘his’ province, where the chances for success were surely the best.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>As expected (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2005</a></span>: 950), the ‘Austria Convention’, which had been convened in mid‐2003 to hammer out a new constitution, ended without agreement in January 2005. Despite 172 committee, 44 presidency and 17 plenary meetings, the issues of executable social rights, a new distribution of competences between the federal state and the provinces and new control instruments for the opposition created insurmountable differences between the political parties. Also, the questions of the introduction of state goals as well as of administrative reforms in the health and security sectors could not be resolved. The president of the Convention, who had been president of the Court of Audit until 2004, presented his own synopsis from the deliberations, but he failed to get the consent of the two major parties (the ÖVP and SPÖ), which was necessary for a constitutional revision. In addition, provincial politicians vehemently rejected the proposed new distribution of competences, which they regarded as excessive centralisation. The papers of the Convention were handed over to the <i>Nationalrat</i>, which set up a special committee to debate them. The committee held four meetings by the end of the year, but did not come to any conclusions.
         </p>
         
         <p>In June, parliament changed the constitutional provision regulating the election of the president of the <i>Bundesrat</i> (<i>Bundesgesetzblatt – Teil 1</i> 54/2005). Before then, the presidency, rotating among the provinces every half year, was automatically reserved to the person at the top of the member list of the respective provincial parliament (<i>Landtag</i>). The amendment was introduced after the designated president for the second half of 2005, a member of the FPÖ (BZÖ) from Carinthia, Siegfried Kampl, called deserters from the German army (<i>Wehrmacht</i>) during the Second World War ‘partly murderers of comrades’ and deplored the ‘brutal persecution of Nazis’ after 1945. Especially in the year 2005, when the 60th anniversary of the end of the war and the liberation from the Nazi regime was celebrated, the statements were generally regarded as inappropriate and damaging to Austria's image in the world. Leading politicians of all parties urged Kampl, who could not be kept from taking over his future position by legal means (not even the delegating <i>Landtag</i> of Carinthia was able to recall him), to step down; he refused, however. That is why the constitution had to be changed; the <i>Nationalrat</i> as well as the <i>Bundesrat</i> took a unanimous decision (in the <i>Bundesrat</i>, however, four of the five members of the Freedomite parliamentary group left the room before the vote). From now on, the <i>Landtag</i> entitled to nominate the president can choose another candidate from among the members of the same party; the majority of the members of the respective party in the <i>Landtag</i> have to agree to the decision. The Carinthian <i>Landtag</i> thereupon selected the second BZÖ member whom the province had sent into the <i>Bundesrat</i> to become its next president. Kampl remained an ordinary member of the <i>Bundesrat</i>; he left the Freedomite parliamentary group, however.
         </p>
         
         <p>As a consequence of the rather mediocre ranking of Austrian pupils in the PISA tests, in May parliament approved a school package that should make reform of the school system easier in the future (<i>Bundesgesetzblatt – Teil 1</i> 91/2005). Because of the delicacy of the issue, substantial school reforms in Austria require a constitutional law (i.e., a two‐thirds majority in parliament). The new amendment abolished the two‐thirds requirement for some provisions, but maintained it as far as an ‘adequate differentiation’ of the school system, the introduction of school fees or the restriction of religious education were concerned. However, constitutional lawyers criticised the new provisions as having been formulated in such an unclear way that an interpretation by the Constitutional Court would be necessary. In fact, the ÖVP and SPÖ disagreed over the major question of whether the new regulation allowed for the introduction of comprehensive schools for all 10 to 14 year‐old pupils (as the SPÖ argued) or not (as the ÖVP argued).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Issues pertaining to the European Union (EU) were prominent in the national political debate throughout 2005. First, in July, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) struck down a law restricting the access of foreign students to Austrian universities to those who had the right to study in their home country as well, on the grounds that it discriminated against students on the basis of their nationality. In order to prevent the inrush of, above all German, students who had been excluded from studying by a <i>numerus clausus</i> system, a law was passed that abolished the previous right of free access to study at Austrian universities. For two years, the universities were allowed to make a place at the university in eight disciplines (among them medicine, business economics and journalism) dependent on good school grades, an entrance examination or a successfully completed entrance phase.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second issue, which had long created problems in the EU‐Austrian relationship, referred to the transit of trucks through the Alpine regions of Austria (see also <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2004</a></span>: 948). In July, the ECJ decided that the sectoral driving bans (for certain goods, such as waste, cereals, stones and wood) that had been introduced in 2003 in parts of the province of Tyrol and had 80 per cent of their application to foreign truck companies, had to be lifted. However, the sectoral driving bans were not declared illegal as such, but only because they had been implemented too rapidly, without consulting the other Member States and the European Commission. In December, the Commission revealed its plans to charge Austria before the ECJ because of excessive motorway tolls at the Brenner, the border between Austria and Italy. According to a new Directive on the Charging of Heavy Goods Vehicles for the Use of Certain Infrastructures, just passed by the European Parliament, tolls could be increased by 15 per cent in sensitive regions and by 25 per cent in mountain regions, allowing Austria to maintain the current level of the Brenner toll. Still, the toll revenues could only be used for transport measures (such as the planned construction of a Brenner tunnel), not for covering external environmental or health costs.
         </p>
         
         <p>Third, the issue of the EU accession of Turkey, which had already been discussed in the year 2004 (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2005</a></span>: 952−953), stayed on the agenda. With the votes of Austria, the European Council of the heads of state and government decided in December 2004 that negotiations were to start in October 2005. Now BZÖ chairman Haider, contrary to previous statements, demanded that the Austrian government block Turkey's accession. Bearing in mind that the Austrian public and all parties (except the Greens) were quite averse to accepting Turkey as a future EU member, the government pleaded for an enhancement of the negotiation mandate that had been defined by the previous Council decision as an ‘open process’. The Austrian government wanted to extend the mandate by the explicit formulation that ‘alternatives’ to full accession should be considered as well. However, the Austrian attempts failed; the only ‘success’ for the government was that the aspect of the ‘absorbing capacity’ of the EU, which had already been mentioned in the original mandate, was stressed a bit. All other parties blamed Chancellor Schüssel (ÖVP) for the failure.
         </p>
         
         <p>As in the years before, the issue of migration ranked high on the political agenda. The BZÖ, under pressure to show a clearer profile because of its position as junior partner in the coalition, argued for a more restrictive policy. It pointed to the fact that in the much bigger Germany in 2004, only 960 asylum seekers had gotten a positive decision (i.e., 1.5 per cent of the applicants), while in Austria 5,136 (i.e., 20.2 per cent of the applicants) did so (<i>Der Standard</i>, 4 May 2005). In July, parliament (by the votes of ÖVP, BZÖ and almost all MPs of the SPÖ, against the votes of the Greens) sanctioned a new asylum law that increased the time during which asylum seekers could be deported from six to ten months and allowed forcible feeding of asylum seekers who go on hunger strike as well as the deportation of traumatised people. Additionally, the duration of the German language course, which is necessary for permanent residence (over five years) in Austria, was extended from 100 to 300 hours, and family members are to get a work permit after one year instead of 2–3 years as before. On the suggestion of the Minister of Justice from the BZÖ, ‘misguidance to the abuse of applications for asylum’ was entered into the criminal code. In September, the waiting period to acquire Austrian citizenship was extended from seven to ten years (so that Austria, together with Italy, Spain and Portugal, now numbers among the EU states with the longest waiting periods). Even EU citizens will now have to wait six years before they can apply for citizenship. The Greens criticised the restrictions and reproached in particular the SPÖ for having agreed to the government initiatives; they speculated that the SPÖ supported the new laws in order to enhance its chances to be accepted as future coalition partner by the ÖVP.
         </p>
         
         <p>The political conflict about the rights of the Slovenian minority in the province of Carinthia intensified in 2005. Already in 2001, the Austrian Constitutional Court had struck down a law as well as the ordinance implementing it as violations of Article 7 of the Treaty of Vienna (1955) in which the rights of the Slovene and Croatian minorities in Austria are guaranteed. The voided provisions determined that bilingual (German and Slovenian) local signs had to be set up in all ethnically mixed districts of the province with a share of more than 25 per cent Slovenians. According to the Court, a share of 10 per cent would be enough (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2003</a></span>: 918–919), increasing the number of bilingual signs to be set up from 70 to 394. In order not to lose his coalition partner, Chancellor and ÖVP party chairman Schüssel only lukewarmly advised Haider to implement the Court's decision. Instead, he organised three so‐called ‘consensus conferences’ in 2002, convening the federal and the provincial government, the political parties of the province as well as representatives of Carinthian Homeland and of Slovenian organisations; the conferences, however, brought no results. In 2005, another five consensus conferences were held under the chairmanship of a prominent historian. A compromise was reached, including the setting up of 158 additional signs, an ‘opening clause’ for further signs and subsidies for cultural activities of the Slovenian minority. However, a month after the agreement the representative of one of the two Homeland organisations withdrew his signature, pointing to the danger that neighbouring Slovenia could use the signs to claim parts of the Carinthian country. Haider used the opportunity to continue his obstructive course. With the support of the Carinthian SPÖ, he called upon Chancellor Schüssel to initiate a constitutional law resolving the matter once and for all. SPÖ, Greens, constitutional lawyers and media objected that the conflict put the Austrian constitutional state and in particular the authority of the Constitutional Court in question and put a shame on Austria in the world at a time when national boundaries in Europe were about to disappear.
         </p>
         
         <p>In autumn 2005, provincial elections were due in three provinces: Styria, Vienna and Burgenland. The election campaigns received intensive media attention as the elections were treated as the first hard tests for the electoral potential of the recently formed BZÖ and the future prospects of the centre‐right coalition at the federal level. In Styria, where elections were held on 2 October, the leading ÖVP under its popular provincial governor lost its relative majority and the position of government chief as a result of a series of scandals and internal conflicts. At first, the audit office revealed a system of waste, double accounts and lack of adequate control mechanisms in the provincial government's management of subsidies. Then, a former member of the provincial government, who subsequently had been dismissed as director of the provincial energy company because of heavy infighting in the management, informed the public that ÖVP circles (up to Federal Chancellor Schüssel) had offered him generous financial compensation (about €300,000) and attractive jobs if he would refrain from setting up his own party list for the provincial elections (further damaging the electoral prospects of the ÖVP). The provincial governor denied having any knowledge of the dubious offers in the beginning, but had to acknowledge her direct involvement later. As a result, the ÖVP gained only 38.7 per cent of the votes (a loss of 8.6 per cent) and − for the first time since 1945 − had to surrender the position of provincial governor to the SPÖ (with 41.7 per cent, a gain of 9.4 per cent).</p>
         
         <p>Another surprise of the Styrian election was the good performance of the Communist Party of Austria (<i>Kommunistische Partei Österreichs</i>, KPÖ), which gained 6.3 per cent of the votes; it was the first time since 1965 that the Communists successfully re‐entered a provincial parliament. The KPÖ top candidate, a member of the executive board in the capital city of the province (responsible for housing) and, according to opinion polls, the most trustworthy Styrian politician, offered a ‘soft’ version of a Communist programme, campaigned using Christian slogans (like ‘giving instead of taking’) and was obviously able to attract many protest voters. ÖVP warnings that a ‘red‐red’ coalition was aspiring to reach power obviously were not convincing. The Greens, whose party leadership was criticised internally for being too much interested in maintaining its power and too little in concrete issues, lost votes for the first time in a provincial election since the installation of the ÖVP‐FPÖ coalition at the federal level in February 2000 and ended up with only 4.7 per cent (a loss of 0.9 per cent). The FPÖ lost 7.8 per cent of the votes (now 4.6 per cent) and all its (7) seats in parliament. Neither the BZÖ (1.7 per cent of the votes) nor the list of the above‐mentioned ÖVP rebel (2.1 per cent) had a chance to win representation. The new government, which by constitutional provision is proportionally composed, now has five SPÖ and four ÖVP members.
         </p>
         
         <p>The election result in Styria meant that after the provincial elections in Salzburg in March 2004 (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2005</a></span>: 955) the ÖVP had to face the loss of its majority in another of its ‘core’ provinces in a short time. While traditionally since 1945 most of the provinces had been ruled by ÖVP governors, from now on four of the nine provinces were governed by an ÖVP and four by an SPÖ governor (the fifth, Carinthia, by BZÖ chief Haider). A second consequence was that the SPÖ and Greens (with 32 members) now held the majority in the <i>Bundesrat</i> (see also <b>Cabinet report</b> above). And the FPÖ (or, more precisely, the ‘Freedomite Parliamentary Group’), which was reduced from five to four members, lost its status as ‘faction’ in the <i>Bundesrat</i> and consequently the access to state financing.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Burgenland, the provincial elections on 9 October prolonged the predominance of the SPÖ, which had held the position of provincial governor since 1964. The victory of the SPÖ was not self‐evident, however, after the party had tried to sell the state's shares of the bank of Burgenland in a non‐transparent way to a private entrepreneur. Several members of the supervisory board of the bank resigned because they had not been informed about the details of the purchase. The deal also met resistance from the other parties, which blamed the SPÖ for not having demanded sufficient financial guarantees from the entrepreneur. All of them had one primary goal, to prevent the SPÖ from regaining an absolute majority. They failed, however. While the SPÖ won 52.2 per cent of the votes (an increase of 5.6 per cent) and, for the first time since 1982, had an absolute majority of votes and seats in parliament, the ÖVP increased its share of the votes only by 1.1 per cent, to 36.4 per cent (although it was the first time since 1956 that the ÖVP was able to win additional votes in an election). The Greens, in the second provincial election in a row, suffered a minor defeat as they reached only 5.2 per cent of the votes (a loss of 0.3 per cent). The FPÖ lost 6.8 per cent of the votes (now 5.8 per cent), but could at least maintain two of its four seats in parliament. The BZÖ, anticipating another setback, did not run for office. The new (proportionally composed) government includes four SPÖ and three ÖVP members, as before the election.</p>
         
         <p>In the capital city of Vienna, the provincial elections (which are municipal elections at the same time) were held on 23 October. Anything other than a clear victory of the SPÖ, which had been the politically dominating party since the First World War, most of the time with an absolute majority, would have been a surprise. The ÖVP, which had put liberal (instead of conservative) candidates at the top of its list, tried above all to win voters by presenting new faces. One of its most prominent candidates was the chairwoman of the ÖVP group in the European Parliament, a well‐known former television news reader. The Greens, which in Vienna are traditionally more left‐oriented than in the rest of the country, tried to make a ‘basic income’ for all people the central issue of their campaign, but did not succeed in attracting votes of the workers.</p>
         
         <p>The top candidate of the FPÖ was Heinz‐Christian Strache, who (after the secession of the BZÖ) was elected new national party chairman of the FPÖ by 90.1 per cent of the delegates at a party congress in April 2005. The ‘new’ FPÖ copied the traditional campaign issues of the ‘old’ FPÖ (during its opposition years under chairman Haider): immigration, criminality and security. Two of its most prominent slogans were ‘Pummerin [the name of the bell in the Catholic St. Stephen's cathedral] instead of Muezzin’ and ‘German instead of understanding nothing’. The president of the Jewish community (<i>Israelitische Kultusgemeinde</i>) denounced the FPÖ for using campaign methods similar to the National Socialists in the 1920s and 1930s. Nevertheless, the FPÖ won 14.8 per cent of the votes, meaning a loss of only 5.4 per cent (considerably less than opinion polls had predicted). The FPÖ celebrated the result as a great success, announcing the ‘rebirth’ of the ‘real’ third camp (‘real’ in contrast to the BZÖ). The BZÖ, once again, remained below the surface of visibility and did not get more than 1.7 per cent of the votes; even the efforts of its well‐known chairman Haider could not avert the failure.
         </p>
         
         <p>The results of the three provincial elections intensified the debate about the fate of the federal ÖVP‐BZÖ government. Haider and his followers obviously underestimated the fact that party structures were necessary for political success. The opposition parties, the SPÖ and Greens, argued that the BZÖ was a party without voters and that the government therefore lacked political (not constitutional) ‘legitimacy’. The ‘new’ FPÖ interpreted the election result in Vienna as a proof that the decision of Haider and his followers to separate from the FPÖ and form the BZÖ was a major strategic mistake. Moreover, the SPÖ and Greens used their newly won majority in the upper house, time and again vetoing bills and thereby slowing down the lawmaking process. Because of the poor outlook for the BZÖ, the media boomed with coalition speculations as general elections were due in autumn 2006 and a renewal of the ÖVP‐BZÖ coalition seemed rather unlikely.</p>
