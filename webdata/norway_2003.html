         <p>Having been remarkably stable since its investiture in October 2001, Prime Minister Bondevik (KrF) made six changes to his cabinet in 2004. On 8 March, Minister of Labour and Government Administration Victor D. Norman (H) resigned to go back to his post as Headmaster of the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration. Apparently he had already wanted to resign in 2003, and many had expected him to do so after the unveiling of his violations of public regulations (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2004</a></span>: 1104), but Prime Minister Bondevik urged him to weather the storm. Norman was replaced by Morten A. Meyer (H) who had served as Secretary of State at the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
         </p>
         
         <p>A somewhat bigger reshuffling of the cabinet took place in June when Minister of Petroleum and Energy Einar Steensnæs (KrF) and Minster of Social Affairs Ingjerd Schou (H) both resigned and returned to their places in Parliament. Steensnæs was replaced by Thorhild Widvey (H) who had served as State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Schou was replaced by former Minister of Health Dagfinn Høybråten (KrF), who became responsible for a reorganised Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Ansgar Gabrielsen (H), who had been serving as Minister of Trade and Industry, took over as new Minister of Health and Care Services, while former Minister of Environmental Affairs Børge Brende (H) became the new Minister of Trade and Industry. Finally, Knut Arild Hareide, who is second deputy leader to the Christian People's Party, became the new Minister of Environmental Affairs. These changes could be seen as a better fit in terms of the parties’ political profile and core issues. As the new Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, the leader of KrF, Dagfinn Høybråten, emphasised the party's image in fighting poverty, whereas the Ministry of Trade and Industry undoubtedly is important for the Conservatives.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>Three ministries were reorganised and two changed name in 2004. This was announced on 18 June, but the changes took place on 1 October. The Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour and Government Administration were abolished and replaced with a new Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, a new Ministry of Health and Care Services and a new Ministry of Modernisation.</p>
         
         <p>The new Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (<i>Arbeids og Sosialdepartementet</i>) comprises parts of the former Ministry of Social Affairs, the former Ministry of Labour and Government Administration and the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. The new Ministry is responsible for the following departments: Labour, Working Environment and Safety, Social Insurance, Social Policy, and Administrative and Financial Affairs. The main focus for the Ministry will be to shape an overall policy for the labour market, employment and living conditions, work‐related performance, and social benefits and pensions. It will also play a major part in coordinating poverty and drug and alcohol policies. A major motive behind the new organisation is to concentrate the political responsibility for labour market services, social security, national insurance and assistance under a single minister.
         </p>
         
         <p>The new Ministry of Health and Care Services (<i>Helse og omsorgsdepartementet</i>) comprises the former Ministry of Health and parts of the former Ministry of Social Affairs. The new Ministry is responsible for the following departments: Health, Social Services, Public Health, Medical Law, Ownership, Administration, Budget and Economy. The main focus for the Ministry will be to shape an overall policy for nursing, care and health services, and action programmes for drug addicts.
         </p>
         
         <p>The new Ministry of Modernisation (<i>Moderniseringsdepartementet</i>) comprises most of the former Ministry of Labour and Government Administration and parts of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. It will undertake the responsibility for coordinating Information Technology (IT) policy as well as trade‐related public competition policy. The Ministry is responsible for the following departments: Administration, Readjustment and Personnel Policy, Government Administration, Public Sector Competition, IT Policy, and the Unit of Economic Analysis and Negotiations. It is also a liaison ministry for the Royal House and the Royal Court. The main focus for the new Ministry will be to, as the name suggests, modernise the public sector. It is responsible for public employees, but will also be accountable for national IT policy as well as competition policy.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Ministry of Agriculture changed its name to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (<i>Landbruks‐ og matdepartementet</i>), and the Ministry of Fisheries changed its name to Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs (<i>Fiskeri‐ og kystdepartementet</i>). These changes did not imply any change in the fields of responsibility of these ministries.
         </p>
         
         <p>In September, the <i>Storting</i> came to an agreement on changes to Paragraph 100 of the Norwegian Constitution, which relates to freedom of speech. The paragraph had not been changed since the Constitution was agreed upon in 1814, and major changes in society have made it rather outdated. In 1996 a ‘freedom of speech commission’ was formed to review and propose changes to this paragraph and their proposals were handed over to the government in 1999 (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">NOU 1999</a></span>). A majority consisting of two‐thirds of Parliament is needed to make changes to the Constitution, and although all parties agreed that a revision to Paragraph 100 was needed, there was disagreement over how the paragraph should change. Labour and the Progressive Party supported the proposal made by the commission and did not want to distinguish between different types of media. The government parties (Conservatives, Christian Peoples Party, Liberals) proposed a less liberal change (St.meld nr. 26 (2003–2004)), allowing forms of advance censoring and were supported by the Socialist Left Party.
         </p>
         
         <p>A compromise was reached and the necessary majority to change the Constitution achieved. Advance censoring is now only allowed to protect children and youth from moving pictures. Moreover, Parliament agreed to change Paragraph 100 to include some restrictions based on ‘particularly weighty considerations’. Compared to the old paragraph, which only protects freedom of speech from state intervention, the new paragraph gives more complete protection and also secures constitutional protection from private intervention. The principle of public access to information was also added, as were the right to demonstrate and the state's responsibility to create and maintain channels for public discussion. While a majority agrees that the new paragraph implies an expansion of rights concerning freedom of speech, critics claim it represents a European minimum limit that already is secured through Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The change to the Paragraph 100 will nevertheless need to be followed up by ordinary law and regulations. Of particular importance to the political parties is that the new paragraph opens the possibility of political and religious advertisements on television.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The Norwegian economy was good in 2004. There was increased growth and interest rates were still exceptionally low. Increased productivity and reduced absence due to sickness caused employment figures to go up while keeping unemployment rates stable. Hence, other issues created more political debate in 2004.</p>
         
         <p>One of the central debates dealt with how to arrange retirement pensions in the future. In January, a Pension Commission presented its recommendations on how to reform Norway's pension system. The commission stressed how increased higher education makes people enter the labour market at a later age, while people in the workforce tend to retire earlier. Moreover, increased longevity also means the ranks of retirees are expanding rapidly. As a consequence, reforms are needed to protect pension fund assets as the number of workers paying into the system will probably fall below the number of retirees collecting benefits. The commission's projections suggested that the state pension system's costs will comprise 18 per cent of Norway's GNP in 2050 if reforms are not made. That would be three times the current level.</p>
         
         <p>Although a majority of the parties seemed to agree that reforms are needed, not all parties agreed on how this reform should be organised. The government parties supported most of the commission's suggestions, whereas the leftist parties were sceptical of several of the suggestions. Labour and the trade unions found it problematic that a new reform would make cuts particularly for public sector employee benefits, which under the current system have very good arrangements. The government parties argued that public employees’ pension benefits already have been too beneficial compared to those of private employees. Although many private companies have offered inhouse pension benefits, there are also many private employees who work in companies that do not offer a private pension plan to augment state retirement benefits.</p>
         
         <p>Another suggestion that created political controversy, and made the Socialist Left Party oppose the government and the commissions’ suggestion, was that income earned over a lifetime should count towards pension benefits, and not just the most highly paid twenty years, as is the case under the current system. The party argued that this would create an unfair system where those who left the labour market even temporarily (e.g., to study or raise a family) would suffer.</p>
         
         <p>It was suggested that the full reform apply to those born after 1965, while all or part of the current system applies to those born before 1965. This spurred something of an age dispute where youth organisations accused the commission and the government of taking all the plums themselves. Pensions are, however, not an issue that interests most young people and hence this aspect of the debate did not get much attention.</p>
         
         <p>Education was another issue high on the agenda in 2004. Labour and the Socialist Left Party worried about the increased number of private schools that had opened after the new center‐right government took office, and stressed how this will undermine the national public‐sector school system. Referring to international studies, Minister of Education Kristin Clemet (H) argued that the current school system has given only mediocre results and needed reconditioning. Among the tools introduced by the Ministry of Education were a national test for all primary and secondary schools to secure continuous quality evaluations, as well as the proposal to increase hours and devote resources to basic academic disciplines such as mathematics, science, and first and second languages. Labour agreed that national tests can help in quality evaluations, but disagreed with the government parties on the issue of publishing the results as it would create winners and losers among the public schools and unfortunate local marks on certain pupils. The Socialist Left Party and the Center Party opposed having all schools do the national tests, and argued that a representative sample should be sufficient. They argued that the new national tests will generate negative competition among young children and that education would become oriented towards a standard test in a few core disciplines rather than encouraging diversity and use of local strengths and resources.</p>
         
         <p>Turning to the 2004 budget agreement, it was obvious that all parties were looking towards next year's election. Labour's bad experience from taking over office shortly before a new election (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2001</a></span>, <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2002</a></span>) made the party anxious as they did not want to cause a government crisis. Moreover, it was clear that the Progress Party hoped that an agreement on the budget would make the government parties consider more formal cooperation in a potential new government, something they declined to do. Nevertheless, the governing center‐right coalition soon reached an agreement for the 2005 national budget after talks with the Progress Party.
         </p>
         
         <p>Also with reference to next year's election, Labour, the Socialist Left Party and the Center Party were hoping to mobilise a potential majority alliance to be a strong alternative to the incumbent coalition. In previous years and elections, Labour declined offers from other parties to form coalitions, but in 2004 Labour even wanted to review a proposed constitutional amendment to give the government the ability to dissolve Parliament, combined with a demand that any government must be supported by a parliamentary majority. The uncertainty surrounding the many minority governments made Labour want to create a more stable majority coalition. The Socialist Left and the Center Party seemed willing to join in such a coalition and modified their policy positions to allow for future cooperation. Both the Center Party and the Socialist Left Party said they might be open to gas‐fired power plants, and Labour and the Socialist Left made joint statements that a potential new ‘red‐green government’ would not increase taxes over the current level.</p>
         
         <p>It is also worth mentioning that internal problems for the Christian People's Party continued in 2004. As had been decided in 2003, Dagfinn Høybråten officially became leader in January, but problems occurred during the nomination process to make up the party's election list. Former leader Valgjerd Svarstad Haugland, who represented the same constituency as Høybråten, declared that she wanted to maintain her place on top of the list (the only position that would guarantee a place in Parliament). Høybråten did not want to challenge Svarstad Haugland, and an agonizing process started to secure their new leader a position on top of a party list in a different constituency. The local branches of KrF did not want to renounce their local candidates in favour of Høybråten. Several constituencies were discussed, among others Prime Minister Bondevik's constituency, as he had announced that he did not want to run for Parliament again, although he would be happy to act as the Prime Ministerial candidate. Eventually Høybråten was accepted by Rogaland KrF, a constituency on the southwest coast of Norway. During this dispute, the party fell to a historically low 5 per cent in the polls.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives experienced an opposite effect when it was announced that Jan Petersen would resign and Erna Solberg would become the new party leader. Jan Petersen had not been a particularly popular and charismatic leader (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg &amp; Jenssen 2004</a></span>), and the increased support in the polls was soon declared an ‘Erna effect’.
