         <p>In 2005, 271 municipalities were reduced to 98. Each municipality has an elected (proportional representation (PR) system) board and the right to decide on municipal taxes. A total of 15 counties were converted to five regions with an elected (PR system) board, but with no right to decide on taxes.</p>

         <p>On 18 January, the Prime Minister announced a national parliamentary election to be held on 8 February 2005. In the past, Danish prime ministers have exploited the element of surprise to seize the initiative from the outset of the election campaign. This was hardly the case here as all of the parties were ready and could merely push the button on their respective campaign machines. It was patently obvious that the election was not called because the government was ‘stuck’ and required the assistance of the electorate to loosen a ‘political knot’. Nor did the Prime Minister make any pretence of this being the case. His motivation was devoid of any suggestion of political justification for the election. The simple fact of the matter was that the opinion polls indicated that the government and its support party appeared able to maintain their majority.</p>
         
         <p>As there was no immediate political conflict to be solved, there were no themes that dominated the election campaign. The government set the tone with promises of an estimated DKK24 billion to areas including research and development, families with young children, hospitals, seniors and the environment. The government pledged to maintain the so‐called ‘taxation stop’ and its rather uncompromising approach to policy regarding immigration and asylum. After the government set the tone with their promises, the other parties followed suit – to such an extent that this became an issue in itself in the coverage of the election campaign in the media. Naturally, there were differences as regards the particular parties' perceptions of who was to pay more and who was to pay less – who was to receive a little more, who less – just as there were varying perceptions of whether the necessary financial manoeuvring room existed to cover the expenses, whether the calculations of the growth in employment were correct, and so on. Ultimately, the image began to emerge of an electorate that was struggling to discern a clear and distinguishable ideological difference between the government and the parties of the opposition. For that reason, a significant factor became the perception among the electorate of who would make the best leader for the country. Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen had a clear lead in this regard – a lead that Mogens Lykketoft, leader of the Social Democrats, would have a very difficult time making up.</p>
         
         <p>The leadership issue was further underlined by the fact that the media once again (and once again, erroneously) promoted and covered the parliamentary election as though it were a <i>presidential </i>election, with the primary emphasis on persons and processes, even though the Danish electoral system and party system are quite different from the American and British systems, from which much of the inspiration for the political reporting was drawn. The increasing professionalisation and capital‐intensification of Danish election campaigns became even more conspicuous in connection with the 2005 election.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 8 February, 4,003,616 eligible voters – of whom 947 were candidates (including 299 women) nominated by the ten parties running for election – determined who was to be elected. Participation in the election fell from 87.1 to 84.5 per cent. As such, there was not talk of a ‘mobilisation election’; rather, it was a ‘confirmation’ or ‘repetition election’ as several of the significant shifts witnessed in the election in 2001 were maintained. The Liberal Party maintained its position as the largest party in Denmark, despite losing four seats. The Social Democrats won 25.8 per cent of the popular vote, which equalled its worst election result since 1973 and meant that they lost five seats in the <i>Folketing</i>. Both of the two largest parties lost seats. So much for the presidential election campaign promoted by the media!
         </p>
         
         <p>The loss of the Liberal Party's four seats was partly compensated for by the fact that the Conservative People's Party picked up two – the first time since 1984 they gained seats over the previous election. Furthermore, as the Danish People's Party continued to make gains, there was a clear majority for the continuation of the incumbent government. The historical shift that occurred in 2001 (i.e., that it was possible to form a majority consisting solely of parties to the right of the middle in the Danish political spectrum) was maintained. This meant that the traditional centre in Danish politics remained without direct influence on the formation of the majority.</p>
         
         <p>Measured in terms of advances in relation to the popular vote, the absolute winner of the election was the Social Liberal Party; however, assessed in terms of the degree of parliamentary influence, the party was paradoxically among the losers in the election. The 17 seats they won could not really be used in the manner to which the Social Liberals are historically accustomed. The traditional centre in Danish politics was further undermined in the sense that neither the Christian Democrats nor the Centre Democrats were able to clear the threshold of representation (2 per cent of the popular vote). The novel aspect of the election result was that for the first time since 1973 a mere seven parties were represented in the <i>Folketing</i>, with only one centre party in the traditional sense, as the content in the concepts of left–centre–right were shifting in response to the increasing significance of issues related to so‐called ‘value politics’ relative to the traditional issues regarding the distribution of goods in society.
         </p>
         
         <p>The government presented its programme on 17 February, together with a detailed plan for public finances. The overriding objective was to make Denmark a global leader in terms of growth, science and entrepreneurialism (i.e., to render Denmark the most competitive society in the world).</p>
         
         <p>In addition to the government being able to maintain power and the centre of Danish politics remaining irrelevant in relation to the formation of the majority, the most important immediate consequence of the election was that a total of five party leaders decided to resign immediately thereafter: the leaders of the Centre Democrats, the Christian Democrats and the Minority Party all stepped back, but even more significantly, the leaders of the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party also withdrew. Already during the election campaign itself, the various wings within the Social Democratic Party were preparing for the outbreak of a leadership struggle when – not <i>if</i>– the party suffered defeat. For it was symptomatic of the Social Democratic election campaign that there was a lack of confidence deep within the party organisation concerning their capacity to oust the government.
         </p>
         
         <p>Party leader Mogens Lykketoft resolutely accepted the consequences of the electoral defeat, announcing his resignation as party leader in the course of the election evening. The two candidates who threw their hats in the ring represented the right and left wings within the party. Both wings enthusiastically engaged in the ensuing struggle; almost all means – and accusations – were aired in the showdown. Frank Jensen argued that the class struggle was not dead. Disparity in Danish society had increased during the first period of the right‐of‐centre government, for which reason he would work to create a just distribution of the goods in society by assuming the leadership of a more left‐leaning party. Helle Thorning‐Schmidt, on the other hand, was convinced that if the Social Democrats were to lean further to the left, the party would lose the opportunity ever to form the government. She wished to push the party towards the middle, seeking influence and engaging in political compromises and agreements.</p>
         
         <p>The party congress chose to send the election of the new party leader to a vote among the party's roughly 52,000 members. Considering the organisational history and image of the Social Democratic Party, this decision must be regarded as almost revolutionary. It represented a significant step in the protracted conversion and modernisation of the party. The result of the vote was made public on 12 April. Having received 24,261 votes against Frank Jensen's 21,348 votes, Helle Thorning‐Schmidt won a clear victory over Jensen – but not enough to ‘knock out’ her opponents; they were merely groggy. In her acceptance speech, she criticised the previous course pursued by the party, announcing that the party had now bid a definitive farewell to the image of the Social Democrats as top‐steered and stiff. The struggles between the factions within the party must come to an end, and she declared that those who do not want to be on the team ought to just stay home. It was a bold move from the 38‐year‐old rookie parliamentarian, who had yet to deliver her first speech in the <i>Folketing</i> and was particularly inexperienced as regards the unique environment in and around the parliament, with its array of traps, temptations and tripwires. However, she was able to tackle the challenges before her with the strength and legitimacy that lay in the fact that she was the first party leader to have been directly elected by the party members – a strength she sorely needed, as dissent remained within the ranks.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Socialist People's Party has a tradition of occasionally engaging in rather impassioned debates in the public eye over the political line to be pursued by the party, so the conflict over the party leadership was far less revolutionary and dramatic than the corresponding clash among the Social Democrats. A decision was made at the national assembly to reform the party charter so that the members would elect the party leader in a direct vote. The result of the ensuing election was that Villy Søvndal received almost 60 per cent of the 6,114 votes cast. The new party leader proclaimed that the Socialist People's Party would formulate a sharper critique on the bases of a more clearly defined left‐wing perspective. The Socialist People's Party shifted to the left and the Social Democrats towards the middle, if the newly elected leaders were to define their respective party lines.</p>
         
         <p>In June the so‐called ‘Structural Reform’ was passed in the <i>Folketing</i>. The central agreement was arrived at by the government together with the Danish People's Party in the summer of 2004, but opportunity remained for the other parties to influence the content of the 50 bills that were to convert the compromise into concrete legislation regarding spheres of responsibility and the distribution of authority between the state, the municipalities and the regions. The Danish People's Party, the Social Democrats and the Social Liberal Party were able to reach agreement with the government as regards the future municipal borders. The existing 271 municipalities were reduced to 98, and the 14 counties were converted to five regions. The consensus was limited as regards the reforms within health and education, while the legislation relating to social policy, employment, taxation and the economy was carried on the strength of the votes of the original parties who were part of the political compromise.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 15 November, the first municipal and regional elections were conducted after the passage of the Structural Reform. In the 98 municipalities, 11,407 candidates competed for 2,522 seats in the municipal councils. In the five regions, 1,422 candidates were nominated for the 205 available seats. The national political interest related to the support for the parties among the electorate. The new Social Democrat leader, Helle Thorning‐Schmidt, was very active in the elections in support of the local candidates. This was somewhat risky for her as any losses would inevitably fall back onto a party leader who was already under pressure; naturally, she was working for the opposite scenario. Conversely, Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's participation in the election was much more limited. When the votes had been tallied and the negotiations between the parties and elected councillors were complete, the Social Democrats were left standing as the winner of the election. The party received 34.3 per cent of the popular vote, up from 32.4 per cent in the previous municipal election – hardly overwhelming, but a step forward nevertheless. Just as important, this was far better than the roughly 25 per cent indicated in the opinion polls in relation to national politics. The Liberal Party had to accept a modest loss, from 28.3 per cent to 27.5 per cent. The gains and losses among the other parties were correspondingly modest. The total support to local party lists fell from 7.5 per cent to 6.6 per cent (i.e., the ongoing colonisation of the local political sphere by the national parties continued).</p>
         
         <p>In 2001, the Liberal Party was far and away the largest ‘mayoral party’; 137 of the municipalities had Liberal mayors, as opposed to the 82 Social Democratic ones. These roles were reversed in 2005 as the Social Democrats captured 45 of the mayoral contests against the 36 that fell to the Liberal Party. The Social Democrats retained power in Copenhagen, where the mayor has been a Social Democrat without exception since 1903. The regional elections resulted in the Social Democrats winning four chairmanships and the Liberal Party two.</p>
         
         <p>It was on the background of a particularly strong Danish economy that on 25 August Finance Minister Thor Pedersen presented the government's proposed Budget for 2006. During the election campaign, the government had made promises amounting to DKK24 billion, which they now – albeit gradually and to a modest extent – worked to fulfil. In the course of the presentation, Thor Pedersen said that everything that the government now did was a follow‐up to what they had previously proclaimed they would do, thereby justifying the lack of surprises in the proposal. The so‐called ‘contract policy’ was to be maintained. Neither the Social Democrats nor the Social Liberals were included in the actual Budget negotiations. The central actor was and remained the Danish People's Party. The negotiations went entirely according to plan and without drama. After the traditional through‐the‐night negotiations, the government engaged in an agreement on the Budget together with the Danish People's Party for the fifth time on 7 November. The Budget was passed with votes from all of the parties in the <i>Folketing</i> except the Socialist People's Party and the Red‐Green Alliance. The most significant party‐political conclusions were that the Social Liberal Party and the Social Democrats had distanced themselves from one another, and that the real constellation of power in the <i>Folketing</i>, with the Danish People's Party as the key party, was again demonstrated.
         </p>
         
         <p> <i>Morgenavisen Jyllands‐Posten</i>, the Danish daily newspaper, published 12 caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed on 30 September, well aware that the newspaper was thereby violating the Islamic commandment against producing such images. The newspaper justified publishing the drawings on the grounds that modern secular society was rejected by some Muslims: they demanded special treatment when insisting on special consideration being granted to their religious sentiments, which is irreconcilable with a secular democracy and freedom of expression, where one must be prepared to accept scorn, derision and ridicule. The so‐called ‘cartoon crisis’ had begun. The publication of the drawings triggered severe criticism from Muslim circles, and the newspaper received written and verbal threats. Some of the cartoonists were forced to leave their homes and go underground in response to death threats. On 21 October, Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in response to a letter from the ambassadors of 11 Muslim countries, refused to meet with them to discuss the drawings and the conditions that Muslims are living under in Danish society. The Prime Minister justified his refusal to meet the ambassadors on the grounds that their letter included a call for him to take legal action in relation to the press and that he ought to take steps to hold those responsible for the drawings accountable for their actions, something he neither could nor would do. If he had gone along and held the meeting, he argued, he would thereby have accepted that this was a relevant and legitimate issue for debate, but freedom of speech was absolutely not a matter for debate. He also rejected the notion that there is a particularly hard tone in the Danish debate on immigrants and ethnic and religious minorities.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Egyptian Ambassador found that the drawings were nothing but a provocation, and that they had nothing to do with democracy or freedom of expression. She and the other ambassadors were prepared to continue to work with the case as they felt that there was a need to cast light on the risk being run by criticising Islam in this manner. Among the Danish opposition parties, there was a sense of agreement that it is not possible to compromise on freedom of speech; however, the Social Democrats, the Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party indicated that the Prime Minister ought to have met with the 11 ambassadors. The Danish People's Party, on the other hand, saw absolutely no reason to do so.</p>
         
         <p>The case gradually began to escalate. The government received a letter of protest from the Organisation of The Islamic Conference (OIC). Egypt, together with a number of other Islamic countries, referred the matter to the UN, OECD and UNHCR on the grounds that the Danish government would not meet with the ambassadors. At the same time, they sent delegations to 21 Islamic centres and the Arab League, thinking that this would have an effect on the Danish government with respect to receiving an apology for the drawings. On 8 December, at a meeting of the heads of state and governments in Mecca, the OIC passed a condemnation of the defamation of the image of the holy Prophet Mohammed, emphasising the responsibility of governments throughout the world to ensure that freedom of speech is not exploited as an excuse for violating religions.</p>
         
         <p>On 20 December, <i>Politiken</i>, a Danish daily newspaper, published a highly unusual op‐ed in its debate section. Some 22 retired ambassadors wrote, among other things, that it would have been fitting for democratic Denmark if the Prime Minister had accepted the request for a meeting that had been made by the 11 ambassadors from the Muslim countries, just as they found that the tone in public debate in Denmark in recent years had been sharpened to the extent that it could be perceived as persecution of the minority group of Muslim Danish citizens. They went on to write that exploiting freedom deliberately to offend the faith of a minority had never been compatible with Danish thought or custom.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the final days of 2005, the leader of ISESCO, the organisation of cultural cooperation in the Islamic world, declared that he would encourage the organisation's 57 member countries to cut all political and economic ties to Denmark in the event that the Danish government would not apologise for the drawings. The Egyptian Ambassador felt that this was a signal that ought to be taken seriously as the organisation holds a wide appeal for Muslims throughout the world, and if the Danish government failed to take new initiatives, Muslims around the world would follow the boycott and the international pressure against Denmark would increase. And this is where things stood in the case at the end of the year.</p>
         
         <p>The patterns among the political parties remained unchanged over the course of 2005. As mentioned above, the result of the election on 8 February did not produce any fundamental changes in the balance of power in the <i>Folketing</i>. However, it remained possible to trace a number of weak underlying currents that could possibly increase in strength. The government started their second period. It could therefore become more difficult to convince the more liberally oriented voters who still wanted a more rapid and comprehensive implementation of pure, liberal politics to continue to display patience. There were rumblings about the formation of a new liberal party. There was no indication that the Danish People's Party would moderate the demands to be met for their continued support of the government, and trademark liberal policy was definitely not on the party wish‐list. The Social Democrats were in motion following the election of a new leader, but where and how far the party was going had yet to be demonstrated in practice. If the shift to the left of the Socialist People's Party is successful, it could have an impact on this movement. The Danish Social Liberal Party had to figure out what they were going to do with their 17 seats in parliament, and there were members of the party who were less than thrilled with the strong, continued ties to the alliance with the Social Democrats.
