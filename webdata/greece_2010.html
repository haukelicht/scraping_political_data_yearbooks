         <p>Early in 2010 Greece managed to acquire worldwide importance and attention because the spectre of an imminent default on its exorbitant public debt undermined confidence in the euro and by extension threatened to destabilise further the global economy. After wasting more than six months in half measures, false estimates and other lies, Prime Minister G. Papandreou finally acknowledged reality and formally requested a ‘support package’ from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This he announced melodramatically as ‘a new Odyssey for Hellenism’ on 23 April, his name day, from the tiny island of Kastellorizo, at the easternmost tip of the country. A few days later the rating of Greek bonds fell to junk status, signaling that Greece was effectively excluded from financial markets.</p>
         
         <p>By 5 May the bailout package for Greece had been finalised as a loan of €110 billion (€30 billion from the IMF and €80 billion from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the countries of the eurozone) to be disbursed over three years in several installments according to the implementation by the Greek government of the austerity measures and structural reforms listed in a ‘memorandum of understanding’. This was immediately demonised by its foes as ‘<i>the</i> Memorandum’, symbolising the presumed betrayal and loss of national independence at the behest and on behalf of sinister foreign interests. The representatives of the three institutions (IMF, ECB and European Commission) monitoring Greek compliance with the accord were similarly demonised as ‘the Troika’.
         </p>
         
         <p>The agreement was ratified by the Greek parliament on 6 May in a roll call requested by the KKE and testing the cohesion of both major parties. Out of 296 present and voting, 172 voted in favour (PASOK, LAOS and Dora Bakoyanni from ND) and 121 against (ND, KKE and SYRIZA), while three PASOK members abstained. These were immediately expelled from the party or, technically, from its parliamentary group by sole decision of the leader. So was Dora Bakoyanni, erstwhile Foreign Minister and contender for the party leadership against Samaras in 2009 (<span><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos &amp; Marantzidis 2010</a></span>: 999). Even if she had been preparing to leave the party anyway, this was a splendid occasion for a demonstration of responsible statesmanship on her part. The same was true of LAOS, on the other flank of ND. In sharp contrast, ND became virtually indistinguishable from the KKE and SYRIZA in its absolute and utterly irresponsible rejection of the Memorandum, despite its own heavy responsibility for the crisis (albeit under its previous leader K. Karamanlis).
         </p>
         
         <p>Creating a novel cleavage between supporters and foes of the Memorandum, the vote of 6 May also presaged changes in the party system. Bakoyanni was to found a new party, the Democratic Alliance (<i>Dimokratiki Symmachia</i>), in late November. Four more MPs joined it after their expulsion or exit from ND, but not her own brother, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who remained a ND party loyalist even under Samaras. Its runaway political irresponsibility amidst the crisis also provoked a split in SYN (the main component of SYRIZA). The moderate wing walked out at the end of the party's 6th Congress in June and founded a new party: the Democratic Left (<i>Dimokratiki Aristera</i>). It was headed by Fotis Kouvelis, who was joined by three more MPs. Back in 2008, at the 5th Congress of SYN, Kouvelis had failed to win the party leadership against A. Tsipras (<span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 969).
         </p>
         
         <p>Nevertheless, neither splinter party could provide the leadership that the country urgently needed. For that, fresh faces and ideas were evidently required – but not forthcoming. In fact, the utter inadequacy and the perceived moral bankruptcy of the political class constitutes precisely the most debilitating and untreatable aspect of the Greek crisis.</p>
         
         <p>The protection offered to professional politicians by the nexus of parliamentary immunities and the statute of limitations for ministerial crimes made it practically impossible to achieve a satisfactory resolution of lingering scandals, such as those involving bribes by Siemens and land deals with the Vatopedion monastery (<span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 968, 970). Moreover, a senior member of the PASOK old guard, A. Tsochatzopoulos, provided a prime target of public loathing through his provocative display of unjustified wealth. Erstwhile right‐hand man of A. Papandreou and subsequently Minister of National Defence under K. Simitis, he was accused of bribery in connection with the procurement of German‐made submarines. Indiscriminate revulsion against politicians and anger at their impunity led to mostly spontaneous public assaults on several among them.
         </p>
         
         <p>The creeping delegitimation of political parties and of the political system as a whole was also linked to a generalised wave of increasingly violent and anomic behaviour that swept the country in 2010. It was spearheaded by protesting farmers, who not only blocked highways, as before, but even closed the border with Bulgaria, provoking strong reactions on its part. Successive strikes paralysed Greece in February and March. An even stronger social explosion followed the announcement of the Memorandum. On 5 May in Athens, during one of the largest protests in recent years, violence culminated in the arson of a Marfin Bank building, resulting in the entrapment and death of three employees (one of them pregnant). In the eyes of passing demonstrators, they were being ‘punished’ for not striking!</p>
         
         <p>The shock that this tragedy produced proved temporary. Violent and unruly protests went on as before, promoted, if not organised, by SYRIZA and especially by the more efficient and obdurate KKE. Its own union movement (PAME) paralysed Piraeus harbour in the summer, prevented in particular the landing of tourists from foreign cruise ships, and caused enormous damage to the tourist industry. This was followed in August and September by the violent protests of truck owners intent on preventing the long‐overdue liberalisation of road freight, their protected monopoly. More strikes were to follow. Begun in December, those in public transport in Athens were to continue into the next year, causing major disruption and hardship.</p>
         
         <p>The spread of violent and anomic behaviour was also accompanied by a spectacular resurgence of terrorism, with new groups, victims and methods. Besides the murder of a journalist, a parcel bomb addressed to the Minister of Citizen's Protection killed his assistant in July. Apart from several other bomb explosions, parcel bombs were also addressed to foreign embassies in November. The police, however, were successful in making some arrests. Insofar as a new generation of terrorists may have been motivated by the murder of a teenager by a policeman in December 2008 (<span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 971), it is worth noting that the murderer was duly sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2010.
         </p>
         
         <p>As the case of the truck owners indicates, the most ferocious and lawless behaviour was exhibited by vested interests intent on preserving their rents and other privileges – whether as self‐employed or as employees of the public sector with job security. In the face of such obstruction, the Papandreou Government diluted or postponed the promised structural changes, but found it easier to cut indiscriminately salaries and pensions in the public sector (by as much as 13 per cent, on average) and to increase taxes. Nevertheless, it proved incapable of improving tax collection and reducing tax evasion (which exceeds by far the public deficit and debt). Government revenue continued to decline catastrophically, also due to the deepening recession as gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 4 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>Presumably to improve government cohesion and efficiency, Papandreou proceeded with a cabinet reshuffle on 7 September (see <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a>) involving minimal or questionable changes (apart from the proliferation of deputy ministers and vice‐ministers). D. Droutsas, hitherto Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, was simply kicked upstairs. Despite his successful record as Minister of Citizen's Protection (earlier Public Order), M. Chrysochoidis was not kept in this increasingly vital post where he was needed more than ever. He was entrusted, instead, with the promotion of private investments. L. Katseli was moved to Labour where she might cause less trouble with her opposition to the Memorandum and her procrastination in implementing its provisions. The former Minister of Agricultural Development, K. Batzeli, was apparently punished for her refusal to run in the regional elections (see below). Otherwise, nominal games continued: ‘Regional Development’ instead of the traditional ‘Economy’ and ‘Sea Affairs’ instead of the traditional ‘Merchant Marine’. Finally, the previous PASOK party secretary, S. Xynidis, entered the Government and was replaced by M. Karchimakis.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>Amidst the financial crisis, the excitement and the clashes it generated, one of the most radical changes in the structure of the modern Greek state since its inception was adopted swiftly and with surprisingly little discussion or opposition, compared to the previous consolidation of local government in 1997 under the Capodistrias Plan (<span><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 1998</a></span>: 410). Named after the ancient architect Callicrates, the new plan abolished the venerable 57 prefectures and replaced them with 13 regions, headed by elective governments. Moreover, municipalities were reduced to 325 from 1,034. For both regions and municipalities, a runoff election is now required if no one achieves a majority (more than 50 per cent) on the first ballot. Finally, starting in 2014, regional and municipal elections will coincide with elections to the European Parliament and terms of office will be extended to five years accordingly. Overall, this was a radical streamlining, also promising savings of almost €2 billion annually. The bill was voted in parliament on 27 May by PASOK alone (plus the three MPs it had expelled earlier) against the vociferous opposition of all the other parties (except D. Bakoyanni).
         </p>
         
         <p>According to the new law, not only citizens, but also resident aliens, whether of Greek or foreign descent, are entitled to vote and run in regional and municipal elections (after a minimum residence of five consecutive years). In this connection, it may be noted that the new citizenship and naturalisation law introduced by the Papandreou Government sought to liberalise and rationalise related requirements. The real and quite intractable problem, however, was the sharply increasing flood of undocumented immigrants entering the country, mostly from Turkey (despite its commitments). According to official figures, as many as 132,524 illegal immigrants were arrested in 2010, but only 52,469 were deported and returned to their country of origin. Despite funding from the EU and the assistance of its specialised agency, Frontex, the situation remained out of control and full of peril as masses of such immigrants end up in the very centre of Athens.</p>

      <div class="article-section__content" id="ss4">
         
         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Regional and municipal elections</h2>
         
         <p>The first regional and municipal elections under the new law were held on 14 and 21 November (first ballot and runoff, respectively). They were largely transformed into a vote against the Memorandum or, alternatively, a vote of confidence in the Papandreou Government. Nonetheless, there were significant local and personal factors, which also rule out precise calculations by party. According to plausible aggregate estimates based on the first ballot in the regions alone, PASOK won 34.3 per cent, ND 32.1 per cent, the KKE 10.9 per cent, LAOS 5 per cent, SYRIZA 4.4 per cent, Ecologists‐Greens 3.1 per cent, and the Democratic Left (DA) 2.1 per cent. Compared to the parliamentary election of the previous year (<span><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos &amp; Marantzidis 2010</a></span>: 993), PASOK lost almost 10 per cent, but so did ND (1.4 per cent) and LAOS (0.6 per cent). Gaining 3.4 per cent, the KKE was the main beneficiary of what was essentially an angry protest vote. If SYRIZA and its splinter DA are added together, there was also a gain of 1.9 per cent. Official participation on the first Sunday was only 60 per cent, but this was, once again, based on the grossly inflated and unreal figure of almost ten million registered voters. On the more reasonable estimate of 8.5 million, participation reached a respectable 71 per cent.
         </p>
         
         <p>Despite its huge losses in votes, PASOK eventually emerged victorious with respect to ND. Eight regions, including the largest (Attica), were won by the candidates that PASOK supported (in one case together with LAOS). By contrast, only five regions were won by the candidates supported by ND (in two cases together with LAOS). Candidates supported by PASOK also won from ND the two largest municipalities: Athens and Thessaloniki. Conversely, ND won from PASOK Piraeus, the third largest. Otherwise, a disturbing sign was the first ever election of a municipal councillor from the xenophobic far right (the so‐called ‘Golden Dawn’) in an Athens neighbourhood where tension against immigrants had escalated in the preceding months.</p>
