         <p>The national election to the Storting on 14 September secured a new majority for the red‐green coalition cabinet consisting of Labour, the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party, which won 86 of the 169 seats. Labour strengthened its position and increased its number of seats to 64. The two other incumbent parties both received eleven seats each, which meant that the Socialist Left Party lost four seats, while the number of Centre Party seats remained the same as in the previous period. Among the parties in opposition, more dramatic changes occurred. The Liberals did not manage to exceed the 4 per cent threshold and, by falling back to 3.9 per cent of the vote, they lost all of the eight ‘adjustment’ seats they had gained in 2005 (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg &amp; Brekken 2006</a></span>: 1222). While the Liberals were reduced to two seats, the Conservatives gained seven and increased their parliamentary group to 30. The Progress Party also increased its representation with three seats, despite a rather modest increase (0.8 per cent) in vote share. The Christian Democratic Party lost one seat.
         </p>
         
         <p>Not since the election in 1969 has a Norwegian majority cabinet been re‐elected. Of the 19 cabinets Norway has experienced since then, ten of them have terminated due to internal conflicts, were thrown out during the parliamentary period or lost the election. In fact, Norway has not experienced any government being re‐elected since Ms Bruntland's minority coalition was re‐elected in 1993, and by 2009 most Norwegians were getting used to cabinets losing the election.</p>
         
         <p>The opinion polls prior to the election showed a very close race. Some suggested that the non‐socialist block would gain a majority of the votes, while others showed that the red‐green cabinet was likely to survive. A year before the election the chances of being re‐elected had been much smaller. Support for Labour was very low (below 25 per cent on some polls), while the Progress Party were doing extremely well (up to 35 per cent on some polls), making them the most popular party in Norway at the time. However, when the financial crisis was exacerbated by major financial institutions collapsing during the fall of 2009, there was a large shift in support for these two parties. The electorate seemed to have more faith in Labour's policies, focusing on government regulation and securing jobs, compared to the free market approach that the Progress Party represented. Within a few weeks, Labour had increased its support by approximately 10 per cent, while the Progress Party experienced a 10 per cent decline. Although the election campaign was not dominated by economy, employment or business policy debates as such, the financial crisis was definitely a major reason why the red‐green cabinet was re‐elected. <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Jenssen (2010</a></span>) argues that the crises created a rare ‘state of grace’ situation for the incumbent cabinet: people's expectations of the economy were low compared to their actual experience.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another reason why the red‐green coalition managed to maintain its majority was the lack of a clear alternative government on the part of the opposition parties. After Bondevik II's defeat in 2005, and the establishment of a four‐party centre‐right majority coalition in Sweden in 2006, leader of the Conservatives Erna Solberg argued that the four Norwegian centre‐right parties should try to achieve something similar in 2009 (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2007</a></span>: 1061). The Progress Party welcomed this new approach from the Conservatives, but the two other parties – the Liberals and the Christian Democrats – did not want to engage in a coalition that involved the Progress Party. As a response to this, the Progress Party declared, and even gave the electorate a written guarantee during the election campaign, that they would not support a new cabinet in which they were not a part. On the other side, the Liberals guaranteed voters that they would not support a cabinet including the Progress Party. The Conservatives tried to convince the electorate that a new cabinet was possible, and that only they could put it together.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives strategy was risky because it could easily have provoked a large share of their supporters who strongly dislike the Progress Party. However, this strategy seemed to work well, and the party experienced a rapid growth in the opinion polls, going from an average of 13.5 per cent in June to 17.2 per cent on Election Day. The reason for this increase was that the Liberals and the Christian Democratic Party soon pointed towards Solberg as the leader of a potential new centre‐right coalition (as long as it did not include the Progress Party). Solberg also proved to be a good campaigner.</p>
         
         <p>The strategy that Liberal leader Lars Sponheim chose was less successful. Compared to the other party leaders, he got involved in the campaign at a very late stage and, when he appeared in public, much of the focus was on his guarantee against collaborating with the Progress Party. The result was that the Liberals fell below the threshold. Sponheim also lost his own seat and declared on election night that he would step down as leader for the Liberals.</p>
         
         <p>With 22.9 per cent of the vote, the Progress Party received their best election result ever. Nevertheless, they were not very satisfied with this result as their expectations had been much higher. In June and August they received an average score of around 26 per cent in the opinion polls, and throughout the summer they maintained a high media profile. However, the party was overshadowed by the Conservatives two weeks prior to the election when the Liberals and the Christian Democratic Party announced Solberg as their common prime ministerial candidate.</p>
         
         <p>While the three big parties made big gains in the 2009 election, the smaller parties suffered from voter ‘re‐polarisation’. This was especially true of the Liberal Party, but the Christian Democrats also lost support compared to the 2005 election. Although support for them did not change much during the course of the campaign, or even during 2009, receiving 5.5 per cent of the vote was the worst result the Christian Democrats had received in a national election since 1936. Among the smaller incumbent parties, the Socialist Left Party lost considerable support both compared to the previous national election as well as during the campaign. Many of the party's traditional supporters were, for instance, unhappy with what the party had achieved as a member of the red‐green coalition cabinet (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2007</a></span>: 1059; <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>: 1090–1091). While some voted for the more radical Red Party instead, a majority of the volatile SV supporters turned to Labour. With a decline of 2.6 per cent from the previous election, the Socialist Left Party received 6.2 per cent of the vote. The decline for the Centre Party was only 0.3 per cent since the previous election, which also left it with 6.2 per cent of the vote.
         </p>
         
         <p>Although Stoltenberg II was re‐elected, the relative strength between the three coalition parties changed. This shift was reflected in a new coalition agreement (the ‘Soria Moria II declaration’). The Centre Party retained four cabinet posts, the Socialist Left Party lost a minister, while Labour received two new cabinet posts, thus increasing the overall number of ministers from 19 to 20. The post of State Secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister was turned into the extra cabinet post. This new ministry, unofficially called the ‘Ministry of Coordination’, will assist the Prime Minister in his work but does not have separate fields of responsibility. One of the main argument for upgrading the previous State Secretary and Chief of Staff into a new cabinet post was that this person now has the right to speak and vote as other ministers at the cabinet meetings. The opposition was critical of the new post, arguing that it would create unclear constitutional responsibilities. The cabinet's response was that this minister was not constitutionally responsible for any areas, and that the minister would not present any cases to Parliament. If Parliament asks questions directly of this minister, they will be re‐directed to the responsible minister. It was also made clear that this new post is not to be regarded as a deputy prime minister.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to the new post, several other changes were made to the Stoltenberg II Cabinet. Four ministers decide to leave the cabinet, while six of the members were reshuffled. One of the more important changes was the relocation of Socialist Left Party leader Halvorsen. In the aftermath of the financial crises, Minister of Finance Halvorsen was expected to carry out unpopular retrenchment measures. She chose instead to take over the post of Minister of Education. Education has always been one of the Socialist Left Party's most important issues, and for a long time the party also maintained issue ownership on it (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aardal 2003</a></span>: 22; <span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Karlsen &amp; Aardal 2007</a></span>: 121). However, by 2009, the electorate had lost much of the faith they had used to have in the party's educational policies. Thus Halvorsen's re‐location was part of a strategy that should help improve the party and its leadership's profile on this important issue.
         </p>
         
         <p>New Minister of Finance Johnsen was a well established and experienced Labour politician. He was Minister of Finance during Gro Harlem Bruntland's third government (1990–1996). Since then he had been County Governor of Hedmark region – a post typically used to retire from national politics. Most media pundits therefore argued that the Prime Minister wisely had chosen an experienced Finance Minister to deal with the economic complications steaming from the financial crises, as well as someone who could impose unpopular cuts without having to worry about future popularity or political career.</p>
         
         <p>In a Norwegian perspective, turnout was not particularly high at the 2009 national election: 76.4 per cent of the electorate chose to participate, which was one percentage point down from the previous election in 2005. The ability to cast advance votes in Norway has, however, increased over the last decade, and in 2009, 24.4 per cent of the votes were cast before election day. This was 6.5 per cent more than in 2005.</p>
         
         <p>As in previous years, media coverage during the election campaign was dominated by stories about the race between the parties and the campaign itself. However, in contrast to previous years, coverage was not primarily focused on one or two main issues. Rather, the media spread their attention over a series of different topics so that issues related to education, the environment, the economy, health care and immigration all seemed equally important. Education was still the most important issue among voters (as it was in 2005 and 2001), but the share who listed this issue as important was significantly reduced. According to a large survey panel conducted by Synovate Norway, 26 per cent of respondents stated that education was important for their vote, whereas between 11 and 16 per cent declared that care for the elderly, the environment, health care, taxes, immigration or transport were important for their vote. In other words, there were a lot of different topics on the public agenda in 2009.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In January 2009 the economy was still the most important issue on the agenda, and the main concern was how the international financial crisis would influence Norwegian society, Norwegian companies and unemployment. Blame was not directed towards the government and there was not much criticism of how they handled the crises. By the end of February, the agenda looked very different, and the public debate mostly revolved around immigration, integration and what was called ‘the Hijab affair’. This refers to a situation that occurred in February when the directorate for the police gave a female Muslim who wanted to study at the police academy permission to wear a hijab with the police uniform. At the same time, an employee at the Ministry of Justice published a press release confirming that the police dress regulations were to be changed so that hijabs could be worn with the uniform. Apparently the Minister himself had not been informed about this press release, and for a few days the government's policy on this matter was unclear, triggering a major debate about the neutrality of the uniform, religious liberty, integration, equality and human rights. In Parliament, Prime Minister Stoltenberg confessed that the procedure in this case should have been much better. It appears that both the police federation as well as most members of the incumbent parties were strongly against changing the dress regulations and, by the end of February, Minister of Justice Storberget declared that the investigation on how to change the dress code and the case itself had been cancelled.</p>
         
         <p>The integration debate did not, however, end there. On 21 February, leader of the Progress Party Siv Jensen gave a speech warning about the ‘stealth Islamisation’ of the country: Islamic rules and traditions, she argued, would replace Norwegian law and customs. This initiative triggered an intense public debate, and support for the Progress Party increased rapidly. The other political parties argued that the Progress Party's rhetoric is dangerous, and accused them of ‘stealth generalisation’. However, on 12 March, Labour's Secretary Martin Kolberg declared a fight against ‘radical Islam’, creating a public dispute among leading members of his own party.</p>
         
         <p>The environment was also an important issue in 2009. Not only because of the preparations for the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, but also due to a few local events and issues. Just before the official election campaign kicked off, a cargo ship ran aground on the south coast of Norway, and large amounts of heavy oil leaked into the ocean. It polluted the coastline and significantly harmed wildlife in the area. This event highlighted the political dispute on whether or not one should allow oil companies to drill for oil in the ocean outside Lofoten and Vesterålen. This area in the north of Norway is known for its large fishing fleet and has large, yet vulnerable, fishing resources. Red, the Socialist Left Party, the Liberals and the Centre Party were all against allowing the oil industry access to this area, whereas the Conservatives and the Progress Party wanted to open up this area for production of oil and gas. Labour, on the other hand, did not want to conclude on the matter until they had more knowledge about the situation in this particular area. Supporters of Labour in the north of Norway are, however, strongly in favour of allowing the oil industry access as it will create jobs and improve economic conditions in the region. Another issue related to the environment was the dispute between the incumbent parties about a tax on bio‐diesel oil. The Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party did not want one, but Labour forced its coalition partners to accept it and the Storting passed this controversial tax on 27 November.</p>
         
         <p>Political advertising on television also reappeared as a disputed issue in Norwegian politics. In December 2008, the European Court of Human Rights declared that Norway had violated Article 10 (freedom of expression) when they imposed a fine on TV Vest for breaching Norway's prohibition on the broadcasting of political advertisements. In response, Minister of Culture Trond Giske changed the rules of the Norwegian Public Broadcasters to ensure that small parties are seen and heard. In March 2009, 15 local television stations showed a commercial for the Conservatives to test the new state of the law. The Norwegian Media Authority gave out warnings and declared that they would fine anyone who violated the law again. In May, the Minister of Culture also signed a deal with a very marginal television channel called ‘Frikanalen’, which stated that the channel should offer free airtime to political parties who want it. The political parties in favour of political advertising on television (the Conservatives, the Progress Party and the Liberals) argued that this is insufficient and that Norway was continuing to violate the decision made by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
         
         <p>Lobbying also became an important topic in 2009. Bjarne Håkon Hansen, Minister of Health and Care Services, announced that he wanted to resign from Stoltenberg II a month after the election to start a new career as a lobbyist. Hansen had been an important minister for Labour for a number of years, and had a very close and highly trusted relationship with Prime Minister Stoltenberg. He attracted massive criticism from the opposition and was effectively banned from taking up his new role for a six‐month ‘quarantine’ period.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that one minister found herself on the end of a motion of no‐confidence. In April, a Norwegian businessman, Kjell Inge Røkke, sold five subsidiary companies from his company Aker ASA to another company called Aker Solution. The government owns a large share of the latter company, and when a stock‐exchange analyst stated that Røkke has sold these companies for a ridiculously high price, Minister of Trade and Industry Sylvia Brustad declared that she was ‘furious’ and that she would bring the matter up at Aker Solutions' next board meeting. The opposition was unhappy with how Brustad handled this case, and forced a vote of no‐confidence against her – the first and only such vote of that parliament. As expected, the red‐green coalition majority voted against this censure on 18 June.</p>
