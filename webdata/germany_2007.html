         <p>Two themes dominated German politics in 2008. First, the global financial crisis that had already raised its ugly head in the previous year gained full momentum by mid‐2008 and forced the governing Grand Coalition to resort to an unprecedented degree of state intervention in economic affairs – namely a massive bail‐out for endangered banks and an unlimited government guarantee for savings accounts. Second, while the credit crunch compelled the governing parties to act almost irrespectively of ideological convictions, domestic party politics were dominated by intense ideological conflict within the Social Democratic Party (SPD).</p>
         
         <p>The conflict began after an unexpectedly good result for the SPD in the January Hesse Land elections. The Christian Democrats lost their overall majority after a controversial campaign by the incumbent CDU Prime Minister Roland Koch who had attempted to capitalise on a widely discussed attack by two immigrant youths on a pensioner in the Munich Underground. The results resembled a situation that would be called a ‘hung parliament’ in the United Kingdom: CDU and their potential coalition partner FDP narrowly missed an overall majority, and the Greens and the Social Democrats on the other side of the political spectrum could only elect a prime minister with the help of the Left Party who had won seats in the Hesse Land legislature for the first time. However, the leading Social Democratic candidate, Andrea Ypsilanti – in keeping with her party's strategy in the western part of Germany – had excluded such cooperation before election day. Arguably, this was deemed necessary to avoid allegations by the bourgeois camp that the Social Democrats would also be willing to count on left votes in the upcoming Bundestag elections of September 2009 – something that was perceived to be highly damaging electorally. Furthermore, the very fact that the Left Party was led by the former SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine meant that cooperation between these parties engendered a considerable risk for SPD unity. This seemed to be confirmed by the events following the Hesse elections.</p>
         
         <p>A few days after the election, Hesse SPD leader Ypsilanti withdrew her pre‐election pledge and indicated that the SPD would seek cooperation with the Left Party. When this change of direction was approved by SPD leader Kurt Beck shortly before the next Land elections due to be held in Hamburg in early February, it sparked intense conflict within the SPD. In the end, the attempt to seek the legislative support of the Left Party for a red‐green coalition came to nothing when one SPD MP, who objected to the idea, publicly announced that she would not vote for Ypsilanti as prime minister, because she rejected any cooperation with the Left Party. The unfortunate manoeuvering of party leader Kurt Beck over this issue was widely regarded as the beginning of the end of his short reign as party leader. He was ousted by a ‘coup’ in September 2009, which brought former party leader Franz Müntefering back and installed Foreign Secretary Franz‐Walter Steinmeier as chancellor‐candidate. Such is the high degree of regional autonomy enjoyed in Germany, however, that the Hesse SPD then launched a second attempt to install a red‐green Land government supported by the Left Party – only to fail again because of internal opposition. In the end, an election in early 2009 resulted in a clear Christian‐Liberal majority. The bitterness of the debate was also shown by the fact that former North Rhine‐Westphalian Prime Minister Wolfgang Clement left his party after a bitter conflict over the future direction of Social Democracy.</p>
         
         <p>The Christian parties also had their share of leadership difficulties when the Bavarian CSU lost more than 17 per cent in the Land election under their new leadership (although, remarkably, the SPD did not benefit from this). The result was the resignation of party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Kurt Beckstein. They were succeeded by former Federal Minister Horst Seehofer who had politically recovered from the revelation that he had fathered a child by a woman who was not his wife – a clear indication that the Christian parties have become more pluralistic when it comes to so‐called ‘moral issues’. The openly gay Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust is another example of the new Christian Democratic flexibility. In his case, this pluralism clearly extends into the political realm: Von Beust came to power in 2001 through cooperation with the right‐wing populist Schill Partei and now governs with the Greens following the February 2008 Hamburg Land elections.</p>
         
         <p>In the light of the global economic meltdown, much of this politicking would have alienated German voters had the federal Grand Coalition not proved itself determined to cope with the economic challenges beyond ideological reservations. In addition to the above‐mentioned guarantees for the banking sector, two substantial spending programmes were launched in late 2008 in order to counteract the economic downturn.</p>
         
         <p>Other major issues in national politics include the election of the first non‐ethnic German national party leader – Turkish born Cem Özdemir became one of two Green Party leaders in November 2008 – and the resignation of the CEO of Deutsche Post after allegations concerning tax evasion.</p>
