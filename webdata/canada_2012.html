         <p>For the first time since 2003 a Canadian government enjoyed a full year of majority power. The Conservative Government was finally free to introduce and pass legislation secure in the knowledge that opposition parties could not combine and force an election. The Government used the opportunity to move forward with their ‘Economic Action Plan’, producing a budget that boasted of Canada's economic performance and, while it continued to run a significant deficit, promised a return to surplus by the time of the next election. The budget also included a major change to the old age pension, increasing the age of retirement on a gradual basis for those under the age of 54, and made changes to the employment insurance programme and to the environmental approval process.</p>
         
         <p>Commitment to accountability and respect for parliament were major elements of the Conservative agenda when the party came to power in 2004, but their first full year with a majority saw cracks in that agenda as it proceeded with two pieces of omnibus budget legislation: Bills C38 and C45. These bills contained dozens of changes to various pieces of legislation and were passed over strong opposition to both the process and the content of the legislation. Literally hundreds of amendments to these bills were put forward in an attempt to draw attention to the Conservatives' approach. Bill C45, which included changes to the Indian Act, proved particularly unpopular with aboriginal groups and helped to spawn highly visible extra parliamentary protests including an ‘Idle No More’ movement that held demonstrations in many cities and attracted international attention. Fallout from the approval of the legislation included the beginning of a hunger strike by an aboriginal chief representing the Attawapiskat First Nation in Northern Ontario.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to questions about its commitment to parliamentary oversight, the Conservative Party's reputation for financial management and planning suffered a major blow. Concerns and critiques over a failure to adequately forecast the costs of replacing the aging CF‐18 jets with F‐35 fighters were given a nonpartisan focus by the Auditor General's report and fed impressions that the government had misled parliament on the issue.</p>
         
         <p>National attention was also focused on energy issues with the government promoting the Keystone pipeline into the United States and developing a process to consider a highly controversial Northern Gateway pipeline through British Columbia (BC) to the Pacific coast. Discussions over this pipeline contributed to provincial disputes between BC and Alberta with the BC government seeking both strong environmental guarantees and a share of the profits. In December, the federal government approved the highly controversial takeover of Nexen (a major oil and gas company) by the Chinese energy company CNOOC as well as the acquisition of Progress Energy Resources by the Malaysian energy company Petronas. Given that it had intervened to protect Canadian control over natural resources by preventing the foreign takeover of Saskatchewan Potash the previous year, this was seen as an important decision, signaling both a desire for improved relations with China and a retreat from the early human rights focus of the Conservatives' China policy. The Prime Minister indicated that despite this decision further foreign takeovers of energy companies would be allowed only in ‘exceptional circumstances’.</p>
         
         <p>The official opposition New Democrats held a leadership election in March involving more that 65,000 members and, for the first time in the party's history, did not provide special representation for affiliated organisations such as labour. Thomas Mulcair, a Quebec MP and former provincial Liberal cabinet minister, emerged victorious. His election was seen as an indication that the party would be pursuing a more centrist agenda in the future and making a strong effort to defend its newly acquired base in the province of Quebec. The once‐dominant Liberal Party launched a new leadership election process, hoping to inspire attention by allowing all who were willing to register as supporters to vote for its new leader. Early indications were that the front‐runner was the son of former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Liberal recovery efforts, however, suffered another setback in three November by‐elections. Not only did the Conservatives and New Democrats both successfully defend their parliamentary seats, but the Green Party, which holds only one seat in parliament, actually attracted more votes than the Liberals.</p>
         
         <p>Elections in two provinces generated significant political attention and saw two more women elected as provincial premiers. In the oil‐rich province of Alberta, the long‐term Conservative government held off a significant challenge from a right‐wing regional opposition party (Wildrose) to retain power, while in Quebec, the separatist Parti Québécois (PQ) returned to office for the first time since 2003, albeit with only 32 per cent of the vote and a minority government. The Quebec Liberal government had been rocked by allegations of corruption as well as by student protests over proposed tuition increases, but it nonetheless held onto a significant share of the seats and votes. A new party – the Coalition Avenir Québec – led by a former PQ minister who called for a moratorium on independence discussions, emerged as a major player winning 27 per cent of the vote and 19 of the province's 125 seats in its first election. In such a climate there were no immediate prospects of a new referendum on Quebec's independence from Canada. With the Alberta and Quebec elections, women held the office of premier in four of Canada's ten provinces.</p>
         
         <p>Municipal politics generated substantial controversy with the mayors of both Toronto and Montreal facing major challenges. The mayor of Montreal resigned in a climate of concern emerging from the corruption inquiries that had also weakened the provincial Liberal Party. Shortly after this, the mayor of another major Quebec city stepped down for similar reasons. In Toronto, the country's largest city, the mayor was immersed in controversy following a court decision indicating that he had improperly voted on an issue in which he had a personal interest and the so the year closed with Canadians watching municipal politics with unprecedented interest.</p>
