         <p>On 16 October 2002, Prime Minister Balkenende had tendered the resignation of his cabinet to the Queen when both the leaders of his own Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the Liberal Party (VVD, <i>Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie</i>) felt unable to continue the coalition with the List Pim Fortuyn (LPF). The LPF had been torn by internal conflicts ever since the party was founded in February 2002, and these began to spill over into the cabinet in October. Two quarrelling LPF ministers, Bomhoff and Heinsbroek, resigned (under heavy pressure), while the Government continued as caretaker until anticipated elections were held on 22 January 2003.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3%20#t4" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The election campaign was quite different from the one in 2002. Then the LPF leader, Pim Fortuyn, had dominated the campaign until his assassination – and in fact even after that traumatic event. His successor, Mat Herben, lacked his charisma and played a rather modest role in the election campaign. Moreover, the issues Fortuyn had introduced (immigration, Islam and insecurity) lost some of their salience, even if they remained most important to the voters. The established parties had toughened their positions on these issues, however, whereas the LPF had softened its position a little, thus reducing the gap between the parties. Hence the LPF no longer ‘owned’ these issues.</p>
         
         <p>Economic growth and redistribution issues, which were practically irrelevant in 2002, now gained salience as the economic conditions deteriorated. The Labour Party (PvdA, <i>Partij van de Arbeid</i>) benefited from this. The party had suffered a dramatic defeat in 2002 and spent a long time licking its wounds. Yet in December 2002 it adopted a new leader, for the first time through a membership vote. About 54 per cent of the members participated. As this was unusual in the Netherlands, it attracted considerable attention. Furthermore, the newly elected leader, Wouter Bos, was young (39 years old), dynamic and yet also experienced (he had been state secretary of finance from 2000 till 2002). He did quite well in the frequent televised debates with other party leaders in January. Partly because of his personal appeal, the PvdA could win back many of the voters it had lost in 2002 and became the second‐largest party.
         </p>
         
         <p>The CDA remained the largest party. Of course, its leader Balkenende enjoyed the so‐called ‘prime minister bonus’. Moreover, ‘restoration of norms and values’ (<i>herstel van normen en waarden</i>), a typical Christian Democratic issue, remained important to many voters. The CDA won some voters from the LPF and increased its share of the vote, though only marginally. The VVD had changed its leader – though not via a membership ballot – and also won some voters from the declining LPF, but failed to regain most of the voters it had lost in 2002. The LPF lost almost two‐thirds of its electorate. About a third of those disappointed voters stayed home, according to exit polls, whereas the others switched to VVD, CDA, PvdA or a smaller party (in that order).
         </p>
         
         <p>The Socialist Party (SP), a left‐wing party with some populist appeal, did not benefit much from the decline of the LPF. In the polls, it appeared to catch up with the PvdA in November 2002, with enough support to win 24 seats if an election had been held then, but eventually most of these floating voters preferred the PvdA. None of the smaller parties did very well, in fact. Both the Green Left and the Christian Union changed leaders, but did not benefit from that at all. D66 had retained its leader, and lost a seat as well. Actually, D66 and CDA were the only parties that had not changed leaders after the elections of May 2002.</p>
         
         <p>The Upper House was elected (by the members of the provincial councils) on 26 May. The CDA remained the largest party, while PvdA and VVD switched positions. Yet the coalition of CDA, VVD and D66 retained a comfortable majority of 41 out of 75 seats. The left‐wing opposition parties (PvdA, Green Left and SP) made modest gains, though Green Left lost ground. The Christian Union, a merger of two Protestant parties, lost two seats. The new LPF won only one seat. A recount was requested by the Independent Senate Group (<i>Onafhankelijke Senaatsfractie</i>, OSF), an alliance of 14 independent provincial parties (i.e., parties without any ties to national parties). An error had been made in the province of North‐Holland, resulting in the election of the leader of the New Limburg Party rather than a member of the Frisian National Party. In June, the error was redressed and the Frisian Nationalist was finally admitted to the Senate.
         </p>
         
         <p>The electors of the Senate had been elected themselves on 12 March by the citizens of the twelve Dutch provinces. Compared to the parliamentary elections held in January, the two largest parties, CDA and PvdA, did a little worse – though both did better than at the provincial elections of 1999. Smaller parties may have benefited from the fact that provincial elections are definitely ‘second‐order elections’ in The Netherlands, as provincial powers are rather limited. Only 48 per cent of the eligible voters turned up – 2 per cent more than in 1999, but still a lot less than in January 2003. Even so, not all small parties did well. The LPF attracted only 3 per cent of the popular vote, about half of its score in January. The provincial parties did not do very well either, except for the Frisian National Party and the new Party of the North, which won two seats in the provincial council of Groningen. Both parties advocated a federal system in The Netherlands.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>The formation of a new cabinet tends to be a time‐consuming process in The Netherlands. By Dutch standards, it did not take much time in 2002 (only 68 days) but proved more complicated in 2003. On 24 January, the Queen appointed as <i>informateur</i> the Christian Democratic Minister of Justice, Piet Hein Donner. He had performed the same duty in 2002. His task was to investigate all options for a Government which would be able to ‘cooperate’ with Parliament. In February, he concluded the best option would be a coalition of CDA and PvdA. Together with Frans Leijnse, a sociology professor and former PvdA MP, Donner was asked by the Queen to pursue this option. Negotiations between the two parties proved very difficult, however. They disagreed on financial and economic policies, but increasingly also about the impending intervention in Iraq by the United States and its allies. Whereas the PvdA rejected any support for military action without approval from the United Nations, the CDA did not want to alienate the American government by refusing any support.
         </p>
         
         <p>In April, Donner and Leijnse reported to the Queen that their mission had failed. Agreement about budget cuts proved impossible. A few days later, the Queen appointed two other <i>informateurs</i>, the Christian Democrat Rein Jan Hoekstra (member of the Council of State) and Frits Korthals Altes, former Minister of Justice for the VVD, who would inquire into the possibility of a coalition of CDA, VVD and a third party. CDA and VVD had announced already before the elections that they wished to continue their cooperation, but needed a third party to acquire a majority in Parliament. The LPF was still considered too unstable for this purpose – after all, its internal conflicts had caused the collapse of the Balkenende I cabinet. Though the main antagonists were no longer active within the LPF, the consolidation of the party had not been completed; internal conflicts continued throughout 2003, albeit at a lower level of intensity. Thus the <i>informateurs</i> did not meet with Herben, but only with leaders of D66, the Christian Union and the Political Reformed Party (<i>Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij</i>, SGP), while also consulting leaders of CDA and VVD. All three small parties were willing to join a government coalition under specific conditions. However, the VVD proved reluctant to cooperate with the SGP, a party that did not want to separate church and state, and indicated a clear preference for D66. The CDA agreed. On 20 May, the Queen appointed Balkenende <i>formateur</i> of a cabinet of CDA, VVD and D66. On 27 May, she installed the new cabinet, formed and led by Balkenende.
         </p>
         
         <p>The motto of the cabinet was: ‘Participation, more jobs, fewer rules’ (<i>Meedoen</i>, <i>meer werk</i>, <i>minder regels</i>). In its programme, the coalition aimed at limiting wage increases to 0.6 per cent each year, reducing (also to a very limited extent) taxes and controlling government expenditure. It promised tougher conditions in prisons (more prisoners in one cell), and tougher conditions for immigrants (integration courses, a minimum income level for marrying immigrants) and health care reforms. The programme contained four rather radical proposals for institutional reform: an abrogatory referendum, direct election of mayors and possibly of the Prime Minister, and a mixed electoral system (mixing proportional representation with a majoritarian system) (see the section on <b>Institutional changes</b> below). After the electoral earthquake of 2002, most established parties became convinced that the political system was not responsive enough and that the voters should have more say. Moreover, D66 – which had been advocating democratic reforms ever since it was founded – was able to push its reform programme because of its pivotal position in the government negotiations.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The integration of immigrants continued to dominate the political agenda in 2003, both within political parties and in the media. On 19 September 2002, the Second Chamber of Parliament decided to investigate the integration policy of the Dutch government over the last 30 years. The investigating committee, chaired by Stef Blok (VVD), held public hearings throughout 2003. It would present its report in January 2004.</p>
         
         <p>In March 2003 the Second Chamber discussed the report of another parliamentary investigation committee, chaired by Marijke Vos (Green Left), on the question of fraud in the construction industry. Major construction companies had made secret cartel agreements while competing for government projects, involving billions of guilders. Civil servants had been corrupted – accepting invitations for night clubs and sex clubs, for example. Judicial inquiries would continue into 2004.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>In 2001, both houses of Parliament approved a temporary law – the Interim Referendum Act – which allowed consultative referenda. A constitutional amendment to allow binding abrogatory corrective referenda was passed as well, but had to be voted upon again (with a two‐thirds majority) after the parliamentary elections of May 2002. However, the new Government declared that it would not support the amendment and would repeal the temporary law. Thus the prospects for a referendum looked rather dim by the end of the year 2002.</p>
         
         <p>However, in 2003, D66 was able to stop the repeal of the temporary law. Instead, this law would be effective until the expiration date of 1 January 2005, set in the Act itself. Referenda will continue to be possible at the municipal level. At the same time CDA, VVD and D66 agreed to await the decision of both the Lower and the Upper House in the second reading of the constitutional reform to introduce the abrogatory legislative referendum.</p>
         
         <p>A second important point was the revision of the Dutch electoral system of pure proportional representation. The cabinet wanted to improve the functioning of parliamentary democracy by strengthening the individual mandate of MPs, without abolishing proportional representation. As in Germany and New Zealand, each voter would have two votes: one for a national party list (which vote determines the total number of parliamentary seats of a party) and one for a candidate in a district. The new electoral system had to be introduced under the present Government. In November, the Minister for Institutional Reform, De Graaf, presented his plans. He hoped to reform the electoral system without changing the Constitution. Hence the total number of seats in the Lower House had to remain 150. Half of those should be assigned to national party lists, the other half to candidates in districts. The minister preferred multi‐member districts to single‐member districts, however, as the latter would benefit only the large parties. Candidates would have to choose between nomination in a district and a position on a national list. Most parties reacted critically – ironically, the coalition partners CDA and VVD were more critical than the largest opposition party, the PvdA. The discussion would continue in 2004.</p>
         
         <p>A third reform concerned the direct election of mayors. The Constitution prescribed the appointment of mayors by the Queen (i.e., the Government). In 2002, a constitutional amendment passed both houses of Parliament that left this issue to a regular law. However, the amendment required a second reading, which did not occur because of the governmental crisis in 2002. The Balkenende II cabinet agreed to pursue this reform, in spite of some reservations of the CDA. De Graaf announced in September that already by March 2006 citizens would be able to elect not only a municipal council (as was the rule anyway), but also a mayor. All 487 mayors would have to be re‐elected, if they did not prefer early retirement. The elected mayors would receive more powers than Dutch mayors hold at the present time. The Lower House reacted with scepticism. Most parties felt this required another constitutional amendment – exactly what De Graaf wanted to avoid. Finally, a committee was to investigate how the position of the prime minister could be strengthened. This committee was to study specifically the arguments in favour and against a directly elected prime minister.</p>
         
         <p>In January 2002, Parliament approved a proposal to raise again the subsidies for political parties: political parties would be entitled to roughly a9 million (20 million guilders); in 2001 they had received 15 million guilders (a6.8 million). By 2004, the amount would be increased again – to almost a15 million, though the amount was still contested at the end of the year. Some parties felt economic conditions did not allow this kind of increase. In December 2002, the Minister of Home Affairs, Remkes, urged parties to publish the donations and sponsorships they had received before the elections of 22 January 2003. Yet not all parties complied with his request. In October 2003, he suggested that all donations over a2,000 would have to be published. Both individual citizens and corporations would be allowed to donate at most a20,000 to a particular party. Government subsidies would be based not only on the number of seats a party held in Parliament, but also on the party's membership.</p>
