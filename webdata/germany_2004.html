         <p>German politics in 2005 were almost entirely dominated by elections. The stepping stones were the defeat of the last red‐green <i>Land</i> government in the North Rhine‐Westphalian election, the announcement of early federal elections, the unexpectedly close outcome of the <i>Bundestag</i> elections in September and the subsequent formation of a grand coalition headed by the first female chancellor in German history.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the wake of record high unemployment (reaching 5 million in January), the twilight of the red‐green federal government began with the <i>Land</i> election in Schleswig‐Holstein where the governing red‐green coalition missed an absolute majority and attempted to hang onto power by bringing the Danish minority party (SSW) into the coalition. However, Prime Minister Heide Simonis failed four consecutive times to reach the necessary absolute majority in a secret vote of the <i>Land</i> parliament and had to give way to a grand coalition led by the Christian Democrat Peter Harry Carstensen. The tide turned finally against the Schröder Government when the last red‐green <i>Land </i>government lost the election in North Rhine‐Westphalia, the old industrial heartland of Germany and a traditional Social Democratic stronghold. Shortly after the polls were closed, SPD leader Franz Müntefering announced that Chancellor Gerhard Schröder would seek an early <i>Bundestag</i> election in order to avoid a total blockage of the German political process as the government camp was now left without any votes to rely upon in the <i>Bundesrat</i>. Clearly, this strategy came close to committing suicide for fear of dying because the polls indicated that the most likely outcome of an early <i>Bundestag</i> election would be concurrent centre‐right majorities in both houses. After all, the SPD had suffered an unprecedented series of electoral defeats in response to its neo‐liberal turn in 2003.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are good reasons to believe that the decision to seek an early election was also motivated by the fact that the anti‐welfare‐reform party ‘The Electoral Alternative: The Party for Employment and Social Justice’ (WASG) was gaining momentum. This protest party enjoyed considerable support from the trade union movement and there were concerns that it might join forces with the post‐Communist PDS. An early election, or so seemed plausible within Social Democratic circles, might not leave them sufficient time to agree on joint action. If anything, the early election accelerated the process of left‐wing alliance building and the former SPD chair Oskar Lafontaine agreed to run as a <i>Spitzenkandidat</i> alongside former PDS chair Gregor Gysi for the PDS which quickly changed its name to ‘Left Party’ and committed itself to open merger talks with the WASG after the election. A considerable number of WASG candidates were placed on Left Party lists and the party polled almost 5 per cent in the western part of Germany where the PDS has never been able to make inroads.
         </p>
         
         <p>Inevitably, the dissolution of the <i>Bundestag</i> needed the final consent of the German Constitutional Court because, strictly speaking, the <i>Grundgesetz</i> does not allow the dissolution of the <i>Bundestag</i> if the government commands a majority. Hence, Chancellor Schröder had to ensure that he would lose a vote of no confidence by asking most of his cabinet members to abstain.
         </p>
         
         <p>Arguably tempted by the very favourable polls for the FDP and the CDU/CSU, chancellor‐candidate Angela Merkel embarked on a risky campaign strategy that concentrated on advocating the need for even more thorough‐going neo‐liberal reforms. The campaign message included the announcement of a 2 per cent VAT rise and centred on a fundamental reform of the health system and, above all, on a radical model of tax reform designed by the former constitutional judge Paul Kirchhof. Basically, it amounted to the introduction of a flat tax in exchange for an abolition of virtually all tax breaks. Strictly speaking, the official CDU/CSU tax model was less radical than Kirchhof's, but SPD and Greens made sure that this semantic nuance got lost in the heat of the election battle. They succeeded in portraying the Christian Democrats and the Liberals as parties of high earners out to dismantle the welfare state while they positioned themselves as parties of necessary neo‐liberal reforms with a social conscience. Clearly, this took some re‐adjusting in the case of the SPD who had not given much attention to its pro‐welfare tradition during the conflicts over the Agenda 2010, but Schröder pulled off a phenomenal election campaign. Again, the Green foreign secretary Joschka Fischer turned the campaign of his party almost into a one‐man show and attracted huge crowds in the major German cities (only to announce his departure from German politics immediately after the election).</p>
         
         <p>In the end, it was a closer call than expected and the first losers on election night were the pollsters who had predicted a much better result for the Christian Democrats. Rarely has an election defeat evoked a more jubilant reaction among Social Democratic supporters. After all, everything is relative and given the expectation of certain electoral defeat and a clear Christian Democratic victory, the neck‐to‐neck result was greeted with exuberant enthusiasm. As a matter of fact, Chancellor Schröder got carried away somewhat in the television post‐mortem when he flatly denied that Angela Merkel would have any chance of being the next German chancellor. History has proven him wrong, but he was certainly not alone in his judgment on election night. In the end, a grand coalition was formed and the election winner FDP, the only credible party of government that had gained votes, remained in opposition. Other coalition formulas were numerically possible, but politically not feasible. The SPD had categorically ruled out cooperation with the Left Party and the time was clearly not ripe for a ‘Jamaica coalition’ (Greens, FDP, CDU/CSU), which was discussed immediately after election day.</p>
         
         <p>Coalition negotiations were delayed by the need to wait for a by‐election in a Dresden constituency where a candidate had died shortly before the regular election day, and polling needed to be postponed. In the election aftermath, the SPD lost its chairman Franz Müntefering over a rather minor personnel conflict and the CSU chair Edmund Stoiber decided not to join the cabinet. After relatively lengthy negotiations, the grand coalition assumed office on 22 November. It was agreed to revive the reform of German federalism that had been close to a breakthrough a year earlier, but the decision about health reform was postponed. While the SPD campaigned vociferously against higher VAT and the CDU/CSU committed itself to a 2 per cent rise, the coalition treaty envisaged a 3 per cent increase! Even though some 80 per cent of the German electorate was dissatisfied with the election result and raising taxes is never popular, the new government had a good start and Chancellor Angela Merkel quickly achieved very high approval ratings.</p>
         
         <p>Other important developments in Germany included a decision by the Constitutional Court in January that cleared the way for the introduction of university tuition fees; a scandal over the mishandling of visa applications from Eastern Europe, which severely damaged Foreign Secretary Joschka Fischer in the early months of 2005; the ratification of the EU Constitutional Treaty by very broad majorities in both chambers in May; the revision of the Stability and Growth Pact of the Euro‐zone in reaction to pressures by the German government, which had repeatedly missed the 3 per cent deficit threshold; and, last but not least, the election of the German Cardinal Josef Ratzinger as Pope in April.</p>
