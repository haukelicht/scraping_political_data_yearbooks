         <p>The heated struggle for leadership in the Labour Party continued into 2002 (<i>see Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 1055). On 14 January, the central board of the Labour Party decided that a nominating committee should make the final decision before the next national congress. The day after, on 15 January, the incumbent chairman Thorbjørn Jagland collapsed and was rushed to hospital. Some voices within the Labour Party argued that this proved that the pressure had become inhuman – therefore, Jens Stoltenberg should pull out of the leadership race. However, Stoltenberg's critics were soon confronted by a general opposition who said that Jagland's health problems should not be used as a weapon in the party's leadership battle. On 3 February, Jagland announced that he would resign as chairman of the Labour Party at the next national congress in November. Still, the struggle for party leadership did not end, as a new debate arose on who should be nominated for the position of deputy chairman. The problem with these personal conflicts was not only that it divided the party itself, but also and more importantly that voters were scared away by witnessing the serious internal conflicts and major disagreements within the party.
         </p>
         
         <p>The deputy chairman debate within the Labour Party also turned into a debate about gender quotas and equal opportunities. This question of gender quotas also arose on a more general level when the Minister of Children and Family Affairs, Laila Dåvøy (KRF), and the Minister of Trade and Industry (H) proposed a new gender quota bill that would require a minimum of 40 per cent of each gender in corporate boardrooms.</p>
         
         <p>Decentralization also became an issue in 2002, primarily due to three factors. First, because local authorities claimed they were facing a financial crisis. The reply of the Minister of Local Government and Regional Affairs, Erna Solberg(H), was one of rationalization and putting public services out to tender. She claimed that the local governments were too unwilling to experiment with competitive tendering. The second factor was related to the suggestion of the Minister of Labour and Government Administration, Victor D. Norman's (H), to move public administration jobs to locations around the country. The Government argued that this was an important tool in their decentralization policy, but critics claimed that the Conservative's hidden agenda was to shrink and minimize the role of public administration. Finally, the third factor was related to the closing down of several of the regional offices of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). The Government's regional policy was mostly a problem for the Christian Peoples Party (KRF), as several of their branch chairmen and voters felt that the ‘Cooperation Government’ should not have reduced the level of services provided and the power of the local councils.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>Norway's relationship with the European Union (EU) is usually a controversial issue in Norwegian politics. This did not change in 2002, but the three Government parties agreed to render the EU membership a non‐issue as long as they are part of the Bondevik II Government. EU membership is a key issue for the Conservatives, and the Government would disintegrate if it were put on the political agenda. For the Conservatives, application for EU membership is more important than cabinet office.</p>
         
         <p>The Health Minister, Dagfinn Høybråten (KRF), provoked large parts of the electorate when he proposed to change current legislation to impose a total ban on smoking in all restaurants, pubs, bars and discos. This would give Norway one of the most restrictive anti‐smoking regimes in the world. There would be opposition both among the Conservatives and Labour, but even if these parties should give their Members of Parliament (MPs) a free vote on this issue, it would require a major upset for a parliamentary majority to vote against it, as only the Progress Party is against a total ban. The most probable outcome is a broad‐based compromise somewhat less draconian than the total ban initially proposed by the Health Minister.</p>
         
         <p>Energy concerns were also a major issue during 2002, in part because prices for electricity were skyrocketing into levels the Norwegian consumer had never before experienced. The reason was that the level of water in Norway's hydroelectric reservoirs experienced an all time low. This was partly due to a very dry year with exceptionally little rain, but the opposition also blamed the Government for having sold too much Norwegian electricity abroad. Critics argued that a country that normally is overflowing with hydroelectric power should not experience an electricity crisis and possible rationing. This triggered a new debate about alternative energy sources, and yet again the issue of gas‐fired power stations arose (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2000</i>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Another source of energy dispute arose over Parliament's decision to build a new oil and gas field in the Barents Sea. Environmental activists did everything in their power to stop this project (called ‘Snow White’). Bellona, an environmental protest organization, repeatedly asked the European Free Trade Association's (EFTA) Surveillance Authority to halt the project, but without success. Heidi Sørensen, an MP for the Socialist Left Party, participated in illegal demonstrations to stop construction work at the ‘Snow White’ gas terminal. She was arrested and strongly criticized by her fellow MPs. They argued that members of the country's legislative assembly must refrain from participation in unlawful actions that are directed against decisions arrived at by lawful means by the parliament of which they are a member.</p>
         
         <p>A pre‐school day care agreement between the four opposition parties also got a lot of attention. (The four parties – Labour, the Progress Party, the Centre Party and the Socialist Left – together hold a majority in Parliament.) The aim was to present a scheme that will guarantee that there are enough nursery places for everyone who wants one, and that the maximum price for a place is low enough to ensure that parents can afford to make use of the increasing availability. The claim was that this reform should be implemented by 2005. Critics of the plan stated that the agreement was a product of the opposition parties’ desire to humiliate the Government (rather then representing a serious attempt to meet parents’ demands for increased availability and lower prices) as the four parties did not agree on how this reform was to be financed. However, that seemed to be of less importance. As a minority government, Bondevik II would probably only have two options: either to do as instructed by the <i>Storting</i> or resign.
         </p>
         
         <p>As in previous years, and as now seems to have become a norm for minority governments, the Prime Minister had trouble securing a parliamentary majority for his budget proposal. The Government first turned to the Progress Party, but negotiations soon broke down. Then, the Government turned to Labour. This was the first time since 1945 that the Conservatives and Labour met to discuss a budget. Although some progress was made, these negotiations also broke down, and the Government had yet again to turn to the Progress Party. The Progress Party forced the Government to accept, among other things, more tax reductions and the cutting of duty on alcohol. Eventually they came to an agreement and the Government avoided either a major crisis or having to use a vote of confidence as they did last year (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 1055).
         </p>
         
         <p>A tragic death marked the end of 2002. The former Labour Minister of Health, Tore Tønne, had received salary payments from the <i>Storting</i> after resigning as Health Minister while at the same time being paid considerable amounts for advisory services to Norway's most outstanding businessman, Kjell Inge Røkke. The whole point of the severance pay scheme is to secure an income for ministers if they have no other job to go to after they have left office. The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime initiated an investigation into the affair. The media were closely following the case and, on 21 December, Tønne was found dead after having committed suicide. The press were criticized for their relentless pursuit of Tønne over a three‐week period – especially as he had previously been known as an extremely honest and ethical person. The Norwegian Press Association launched an investigation into the media's coverage and soon came to the conclusion that they were not to blame.
