         <p>Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was under heavy media pressure due to accusations of impropriety and taking bribes. After announcing that he would step down as the chairperson of the Centre Party in December 2009, it soon became clear that that he would also resign from his position as Prime Minister. Formally it was up to the Centre Party congress to decide who would replace him as chair. However, as the media pressure did not diminish, Vanhanen could be a risk for the party in the coming parliamentary election to be held on 17 April 2011. The vice chair of the party Mari Kiviniemi, who was free from all accusations, was elected chairperson with a broad majority on 12 June. The party congress naturally could not elect a new Prime Minister, though in practice this was the case. This was a matter for the parliament, which had no problems in approving her candidacy and in June 22 the cabinet investiture took place. The programme from Vanhanen's cabinet remained unchanged and so did the composition of the cabinet. Mari Kiviniemi replaced Vanhanen, who also resigned from his duties as an MP in September. Kiviniemi was Minister of Public Administration and Local Government in Vanhanen's cabinet and she was replaced by Tapani Tölli.</p>
         
         <p>The gender balance remained unchanged except for the fact that Finland had, for a second time, elected a female Prime Minister. Finland was now led by two women: the President and the Prime Minister, of whom the latter is more important due to the 2000 Constitution. Of the total of twenty ministers, eleven are female. However, as the new cabinet had less than a year to govern, it was seen as a pre‐election government, leaving big economic issues to be decided after the election. However, issues cropped up after the investiture. One big question was whether the former Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen, should be prosecuted by the court of impeachment for abusing a conflict of interest in a cabinet decision to transfer public money to a charity closely associated with the Centre Party.</p>
         
         <p>The Centre Party has been involved in a lot of impropriety around party finances. Those implicated include the former chairperson Vanhanen and the former party secretary Jarmo Korhonen, who was replaced together with Vanhanen on the party congress. Later on, Minister for the Environment Paula Lehtomäki was accused of insider trading for buying stocks in a mining company. Although other parties have also been involved in obscure party transactions, it is the Centre Party who has been the focus of media attention. This has opened the way for changing the culture and legislation of party finances to more open and fair play. It remains to be seen if the aims will be fulfilled.</p>
         
         <p>Perhaps as a result of this financial scandal, a delegation was appointed by Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb to restore the reputation of Finland. In November, the report ‘Trademark Finland’ was launched. According to the report, Finland is a problem solver whose knowledge should be spread all over the world. The consultants and members of the delegation consisted of high‐ranking industrial and financial bosses who did not volunteer their services for nothing; the cost amounted to half a million euros. The report got much national media attention and was launched in a spirit of self‐confidence that the aims can and will be implemented. However, international media did not pay much attention to the report.</p>
         
         <p>Much more attention was given to the True Finns and their leader Timo Soini, who in a short time climbed from almost nothing to 15 per cent support in the polls during the late autumn. Fuelled by the mess around party finances combined with populist rhetoric, the party received an unprecedented boost in the polls. The upward trend was also enhanced by the financial crisis in Ireland. The Government was ready to support financial aid, which the True Finns strongly opposed. In addition, the Social Democrats were critical as well. According to their view, the mortgage provisions are badly negotiated and the banks should take more responsibility for their irresponsible actions. Nevertheless, the parliament voted on 2 December, with 105 votes for and the entire opposition (63 votes) against, the Irish bank crisis package worth €741 million. The argument made by the Government was that this is a loan which will be paid back.</p>
         
         <p>In a press conference, Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi discussed an initiative from a group of municipalities close to the Russian border. According to the initiative they prefer to make Swedish optional in Finnish schools in order to enable the municipalities to choose Russian. Kiviniemi expressed her willingness to support the initiative, subject to being satisfied with the outcome of an investigation. Her view was strongly supported by Prime Minister Putin. The former Social Democratic Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen reacted strongly by accusing Kiviniemi of sparking a new wave of nationalism when she tried to seek support from Putin. The initiative is supported by the True Finns and MPs in several other parties. Anti‐Swedish opinions have increased during the economic crisis and so have opinions against immigration. Almost 60 per cent of Finns are against increasing immigration, up from 36 per cent in 2007. These popular opinions broadly work in favour of the True Finns who, most clearly of all parties, are an anti‐Swedish and anti‐immigration party.</p>
         
         <p>The Greens were caught up in big problems as the Government proposed to grant planning permission to build two nuclear power plants. According to the proposal, Finland will be less dependent on importing energy. In addition, industry in Finland needs more electricity and the construction of these plants will create new jobs. At the moment, one nuclear plant is under construction. As many problems have occurred, the project has been severely delayed. According to the Greens, Finland should invest more in renewable energy as nuclear energy and its waste is dangerous. The Greens were allowed to stay in cabinet although they voted against this policy in parliament. A majority in parliament approved the bill and the decision haunted the Greens who were blamed for being loyal to the Government. In addition, their decision to stay in government was not a well‐considered option on the eve of the parliamentary election campaign.</p>
         
         <p>However, during the autumn the True Finns stole the most media attention when they seemed to pose a greater threat to the established parties in the polls. Their party leader, Timo Soini, managed through his rhetoric to connect with popular discontent. He spent most of his time in Brussels as a member of the EU parliament, which did not appear to hamper his national popularity. When the year came to an end it became increasingly clear that the coming election is likely to result in turmoil and that the long‐lasting consensus politics will be challenged.</p>
