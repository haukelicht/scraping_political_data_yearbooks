         <p>Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Constitution was amended in order to give a constitutional basis for active measures by the state to promote equality in rights and duties between men and women – an adaptation inspired by the principles adopted at the European Union (EU) level since the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Chamber of Deputies also modified Article 69 of the Constitution regarding the penal responsibility of its members. Through this amendment, acting MPs can be prosecuted during a parliamentary session. Only arrest (unless the MP is caught in the act) is now subject to approval by the Chamber, whereas the execution of penalties, even depriving an MP of his or her liberty, on the other hand, is no longer conditional on such approval. Hence, the temporary and partial judicial protection for MPs in parliamentary session is reduced tremendously.</p>
         
         <p>In November, Luxembourg celebrated the 150th birthday of the Council of State. This body, made up of 21 members, acts as the legislative advisor to the Government. Its role is to ‘persuade rather than impose’ by suggesting adaptations to all bill projects and proposals that are submitted and for which advice of the Council must be issued and received by the Chamber for the legislative process to continue. As a partial substitute for a second chamber, the Council also has a kind of suspensive veto right (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; De Winter 2003</a></span>). All laws are indeed subject to a ‘second constitutional vote’ to be taken at least three months after the first, in order to allow for a period of reflection, unless the Chamber and the Council deem it unnecessary. If the Council refuses to exempt the Chamber from this second vote, it therefore delays the adoption of bills by at least three months. Although the Council only uses this power rather infrequently (on average once a year since 1945), and in any case only when its views fundamentally diverge from the majority in the Chamber, the Minister of Justice argued in his anniversary ceremony speech that this power should be curtailed (by asking the Council to justify its decision when refusing to grant the exemption). Moreover, the Minister proposed abolishing the mandatory advice of the Council for texts transposing highly technical EU Directives and for international treaties that do not need the modification of national legislation for their parliamentary ratification. Luxembourg is indeed one of the worst pupils in the class when it comes to the prompt transposition of EU Directives, and both the Government and the Chamber engaged in a phase of reflection over the potential adaptations to the procedure that would speed up the process.

         <p>The ADR (<i>Aktiounskomitee fir Demokratie a Rentegerechtegkeet</i>) changed its name to <i>Alternativ Demokratesch Reformpartei</i> (Alternative Democratic Reform Party), and presented itself as an alternative to the Christian‐Social Party to be located on the centre‐right and clearly on the ‘sovereignist’ side of the political spectrum.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>After a couple of years rich in political events (general and European elections in 2004; presidency of the Council of Ministers of the EU, referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty and local elections in 2005), 2006 was a rather quiet political year in the Grand Duchy. The main political issue was the handling of the hostile tender offer made by Mittal Steel (originally an Indian steel company, which has expanded into the world market in the last twenty years) to Arcelor shareholders (for a book devoted to this event, see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Gilain 2006</a></span>). Arcelor had been created out of a merge of Arbed (the main Luxembourg steel company of which the state was the main shareholder), the Spanish Acelaria and the French Usinor in 2001. Despite initial fears over loss of sovereignty over Luxembourg's largest company and concerns about the fate of the so‐called ‘Luxembourg social model’ in the new merger, its consequences were not brutal and the headquarters of the new group remained in the capital city. Hence, in January 2006, the next step in the consolidation of the world steel industry, Mittal Steel's public offer for Arcelor was considered as a new and even more important threat to the country's industrial, social and financial interests. Given the potential implications with regard to the commitments made by Arcelor towards employment and investments in the Grand Duchy, and regarding the location of the headquarters of the new group in case of takeover, the Government first reacted very negatively to this apparently hostile public offer. Prime Minister Juncker declared in the Chamber of Deputies that the Government was against it because it did not understand it, arguing that the offer made by Mittal suffered from a ‘total lack of industrial planning’ and that it would oppose it with all the means at its disposal.
         </p>
         
         <p>As the main shareholder of Arcelor (with 5.6 per cent of the capital) and a stakeholder in the proposed transaction, the Government first consulted French and Belgian authorities. It also hired the services of the JP Morgan investment bank as advisor in the procedure. The Government also accelerated the adoption by the Chamber of a bill transposing the EU takeover directive into national law. The Minister for Economy and Foreign Trade, Jeannot Krecké, nevertheless stated that ‘the assertion that this bill is a protectionist device with the aim of preventing the proposed transaction is clearly erroneous’,<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> arguing that the aim was to create a clear and coherent framework for such transactions (and therefore for all shareholders and stakeholders) in the future. Finally, the Government engaged in the opening of talks between Arcelor and SeverStal (a powerful Russian steel company backed by Russia's political authorities) to counter Mittal's offer. The terms of the latter offer, however, evolved through this first semester of 2006, as negotiations were held between the leaders of Mittal and Arcelor. The outcome was a negotiated agreement in which it was stated that the new merged company would be committed to social dialogue and responsibility (the pillars of the ‘Luxembourg social model’). As the financial conditions of the transaction were also improved, the acceptance of the offer by the numerous ‘small’ shareholders and the main one, the Luxembourg state, looked possible. Hence, at the end of June, the Government proudly announced that the new steel world leader Arcelor‐Mittal (320,000 employees in more than 60 countries and a production of 118 million tonnes of crude steel – roughly 10 per cent of world's total production) would be based on the Grand Duchy's soil. The Luxembourg state would keep 2.4 per cent of the new group's capital.
         </p>
         
         <p>Other events triggered concerns about other pillars of Luxembourg's economic history. Companies traditionally well grounded in the Grand Duchy (and therefore also symbolic for the population), such as the German Villeroy &amp; Boch (ceramics), announced large cuts in employment in Luxembourg. These announcements were accompanied by even more important losses in jobs as a consequence of the decision by Japanese firm TDK to stop producing CDs and DVDs. Another event with negative effects on domestic employment was the relocation of the American military warehouse services (WSA), which were based in Bettembourg‐Dudelange. Altogether, almost 1,000 job cuts were decided during the first three months of 2006, leading Prime Minister Juncker to declare that these simultaneous doses of bad news were not triggered by a drop in competitiveness or by Luxembourg's strict labour laws. Luxembourg had to accept the consequences of the globalisation of the economy and the changes in geopolitics that led NATO to reconfigure its infrastructure network.</p>
         
         <p>The OECD report on the economic situation and policies in Luxembourg presented in the summer, which somewhat contradicted the Prime Minister's declarations, surprised national political and economic actors, and caused another shock for public opinion. The report pointed at the worsening of the budgetary situation, recommended the abolition of the mechanism of automatic salary indexation, cast doubt on the government's financing of pensions and public health services, and in particular targeted the employment administration (suggesting an important reform). It also noted that a numbers of economic sectors were still not open to competition.</p>
         
         <p>Domestic employment nevertheless kept on increasing by 3.9 per cent in 2006. On the other hand, as observed in recent years, the rate of unemployment continued to rise, thereby indicating that the bulk of the new jobs created were filled by people living across the border (mostly non‐nationals, but also nationals, as an increasing number of young Luxembourgers decide to live in Belgium, France or Germany because of high house prices in the Grand Duchy). As a result, the unemployment rate reached a previously unknown level: 4.4 per cent. Taking into account people who benefit from the state's employment measures, as well, the figure is 6.2 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>Among important legislative activity, Luxembourg adopted an anti‐tobacco law establishing a ban on tobacco advertising, consumption in public places and the selling of tobacco products to people under 16. The Grand Duchy had been ranked as bottom of the table when it came to tobacco control policies amongst thirty countries in a 2005 survey that took some of these criteria into account.<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a> With the newly adopted legislation, Luxembourg therefore improved its overall international standing with regard to such policies, even though price increases, which are considered by the World Bank to be the most effective tobacco control measure, were not implemented in a country where taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol are traditionally lower than in neighbouring countries.
         </p>
         
         <p>Two important pieces of legislation were discussed throughout the year and raised some tensions between the coalition parties. First, a bill on biomedical research, integrating dispositions contained in the Oviedo Convention of the Council of Europe, and transposing EU Directive 2001/20/CE on best practices in clinical investigation on human subjects, was on the table. The bill, in accordance with the Oviedo Convention, forbids the production of human embryos for research purposes. The question of the use of alternative, <i>in vitro</i> embryos for research created a classical tension between the Christian‐Democrats and the Socialists on such ethical matters. In the bill still under discussion, the proposal is to ban research on <i>in vitro</i> embryos as well and to concentrate on adult stem cells instead. The second piece of legislation is dear to the Prime Minister, who frequently expressed the need for a law opening the possibility of dual nationality for Luxembourg residents who did not want to renounce their original nationality. After long discussions over the criteria to be fulfilled in order to apply for this, the government decided that a 7‐year period of residence in the Grand Duchy was needed, and that applicants also had to take a test of Luxembourguish (oral) language and follow a civic instruction course on national institutions and fundamental rights. More liberal schemes were on the table, but the positions defended by Minister of Justice Frieden prevailed. Finally, as the Institutional Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies requested, naturalisation will no longer be awarded by the special committee of the Chamber, but the decision will now rest with the executive (via the Ministry of Justice).
         </p>
         
         <p>Eurobarometers 65 and 66 confirmed, after the close victory of the ‘yes’ faction in the referendum over the EU Constitutional Treaty in July 2005, that the population of the Grand Duchy had increasingly mixed feelings about European integration. After several years at the top of the ranking of the support for membership of the EU, Luxembourg dropped to fourth place, with a decrease in support from 82 to 72 per cent in one year. While European citizens share increasingly mixed feelings with regard to future enlargements (42 per cent are opposed), Luxembourg residents maintain their clear opposition (65 per cent against, only 27 per cent in favour of future enlargements). And the period of reflection on the future of the Union apparently did not appease concerns about this prospect as only 29 per cent of Luxembourg residents (a drop of 8 per cent) thought the EU was evolving in the right direction (the EU average was 41 per cent, with the same drop of 8 per cent) as against 44 per cent (+8 percent) who declared the EU was going in the wrong direction. Contrary to the average EU citizen, Luxembourg residents were less pessimistic about the evolution of their own country. It is in this climate of Euro‐pessimism that Luxembourg's political authorities launched several events, such as a national forum on the fate of the EU open to civil society actors (and a website dedicated to information on Europe: <a href="http://www.europaforum.lu" class="linkBehavior">http://www.europaforum.lu</a>), to promote public debate. The Chamber of Deputies also organised a public hearing over the Lisbon strategy.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, Prime Minister Juncker received the Charlemagne Prize – the most prestigious international award for services to European integration – in recognition of his services to European peace and unity, and in December 2006 the ‘European capital of culture 2007’ was officially launched in Luxembourg (events will be organised in the Grand Duchy and the Greater Region – the Lorraine region of France, the Saar and Rhineland‐Palatinate Länder in Germany, the Walloon Region together with the French‐ and German‐speaking communities in Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg).</p>
