         <p>The elections for the first chamber (lower house) of the Austrian national parliament (<i>Nationalrat</i>), held on 1 October 2006 (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>), saw the defeat of the incumbent centre‐right coalition government between the liberal‐conservative Austrian People's Party (<i>Österreichische Volkspartei</i>, ÖVP) and the Alliance for the Future of Austria (<i>Bündnis Zukunft Österreich</i>, BZÖ). It was primarily the Alliance (the smaller coalition partner) that spoiled the governing parties' chances of re‐election. The Alliance was founded in April 2005 when the government members and the great majority of the MPs belonging to the right‐wing populist Freedom Party of Austria (<i>Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs</i>, FPÖ– at that time coalition partner of the ÖVP) left their party and formed a new one. From the beginning of the FPÖ's participation in government in February 2000, the party leadership was criticised internally for betraying its voters. The critics saw the dramatic losses of the party in almost all subsequent provincial elections, as well as in the general elections of 2002 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2003</a></span>: 892–896), as proof that the party was about to lose its reputation as spokesman for the interests of the ‘small man in the street’. Finally, in April 2005, in order to get rid of the ‘destructive’ forces, the FPÖ leadership decided to re‐invent the party. The former party chairman of the FPÖ and incumbent Provincial Governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, was designated party chairman of the Alliance (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1043–1047).
         </p>
         
         <p>In spite of the FPÖ cataclysm, Chancellor and ÖVP Chairman Wolfgang Schüssel tried to continue business as usual, rating the split of his coalition partner as a ‘Mickey Mouse problem’ for the government. The opposition parties – the Social Democratic Party of Austria (<i>Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs</i>, SPÖ) and the Greens – questioned the legitimacy of the ‘new’ government and called for fresh elections. ÖVP and BZÖ, however, pointed out that they still had a parliamentary majority and rejected the claim. Contrary to the hopes of the leaders of the BZÖ (and also the ÖVP), the ‘new’ party did not take off. Right from the start the programmatic profile of the party remained unclear. According to opinion polls, only 2–4 per cent of the electorate supported the new party, making it uncertain that it would enter parliament after the next general elections given the electoral system's 4 per cent threshold. As a consequence, the opposition parties and the ‘rump’ FPÖ continuously accused the BZÖ of being little more than a ‘stirrup holder’ (<i>Steigbügelhalter</i>) for the dominant ÖVP.
         </p>
         
         <p>In May 2006, the BZÖ replaced its chairman, Haider, with the former chairman of the FPÖ's parliamentary group, Peter Westenthaler, who was also nominated as top candidate for the coming general elections. Westenthaler had left politics in September 2002 in protest against the intra‐party rebellion (led by Haider) that brought down the first ÖVP‐FPÖ cabinet (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2003</a></span>: 909−914). After his nomination, he tried to take over the vice‐chancellorship as well, but incumbent Vice‐Chancellor Hubert Gorbach refused to step down and Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel rejected any government reshuffle. Westenthaler tried to give his party a clearer profile and more weight within the coalition. The installation of a new management in the national public broadcasting corporation (<i>Österreichischer Rundfunk</i>, ORF) offered him a good opportunity. ÖVP and FPÖ (now the BZÖ) had controlled the ORF supervisory board since the formation of their government in February 2000. With their majority they had elected, in 2002, a new general director and programme directors with sympathies for their parties (first of all for the ÖVP). Since then, critics – and not only those from the opposition parties – claimed that television programmes in general had suffered a decline in quality and that, in particular, the television news (legally obliged to remain independent and objective) had shown clear pro‐government bias. Criticism reached a climax after the ORF general director attended Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel's State of the Nation's address in May. All other parties, including the BZÖ, denounced the breach of the independence principle. The editorial staff of the ORF news programmes complained about constant interventions by the television chief producer, who was close to the ÖVP, and by the governing parties themselves. As a consequence, in August, a new general director was elected by the supervisory board in a ‘rainbow’ coalition between SPÖ, BZÖ, FPÖ and the Greens, but also including some ÖVP representatives. The ÖVP party leadership was fuming; the defeat in the ORF not only reduced its control over the television news, but also represented a highly symbolic blow to its hitherto almost unrestricted political dominance.
         </p>
         
         <p>The intra‐party turmoil of the FPÖ and the diffuse image of the BZÖ seemed set to ruin the electoral chances of the two governing parties. However, the SPÖ, as major opposition party, looked likely to miss the opportunity to gain a majority and re‐enter government when dubious financial transactions at the BAWAG (a bank owned by the [SPÖ‐dominated] Austrian Trade Union Federation) were revealed and caused a big scandal (see <b>Issues in national politics</b>). The outcome of the general elections grew even more uncertain when Hans‐Peter Martin – a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), whose list had won 14 per cent in the 2004 elections with a populist campaign (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2005</a></span>: 945−948) – announced that he would also run in the national elections. The candidacy of this new competitor presented a particular threat to the smaller parties, who feared that they would lose votes − or even, in the case of the BZÖ, fail to enter parliament at all.
         </p>
         
         <p>Never before had the parties spent so much money on their election campaigns. As a consequence of the expected close race between ÖVP and SPÖ for first place, and the doubts whether BZÖ and List Martin would gain seats at all, the campaigns of all parties (except the Greens) were characterised by a hitherto unknown amount of negative campaigning. A leading Social Democratic strategist announced his party's ‘napalm’ campaign, and this term was cited over and over again in the weeks before the elections.</p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP campaign, which centred on its top candidate, party chairman and Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, pointed to Austria's good economic performance and cited the praise of the government's economic policy by international media. The national media and political opponents accused the ÖVP of leading a simple ‘feel good’ campaign (with ‘Austria – Remains better’ as a major slogan), devoid of substance and ignoring the country's existing problems. Given the problem of financing geriatric care ranked high among these problems, the ÖVP suffered an embarrassment when it turned out that even Schüssel's mother‐in‐law had been attended to by a nurse from Slovakia without a legal work permit. Officially, the ÖVP denied resorting to ‘dirty campaigning’. However, one of the party's constituent organisations, the Workers' and Employees' League (ÖAAB), distributed posters on which the Social Democrats were accused of being responsible for the BAWAG scandal and of general economic incompetence.</p>
         
         <p>The BZÖ, as already mentioned, put up the former chairman of the FPÖ's parliamentary group, Peter Westenthaler, as its top candidate. Realising that only a small part of the former FPÖ supporters had followed them after their split from the party, the BZÖ leaders tried to win back these voters by placing the designation ‘The Freedomites’ on the party's election posters. The FPÖ, however, secured a court ruling that the BZÖ had to remove this designation because of the danger of confusion between the two parties. As a matter of fact, the BZÖ's major campaign issues (immigration, law and order, families) resembled those of the ‘old’ and ‘new’ FPÖ: Westenthaler promised to expel 300,000 foreigners (i.e., about a third of them) − according to his claims this corresponded to the share of foreigners who were criminals, unwilling to integrate themselves into the Austrian society, and abusing the right of asylum. In addition, he wanted to have people convicted of child abuse placed under surveillance for the rest of their lives and to increase the (already rather generous) welfare benefits for families.</p>
         
         <p>To demarcate itself from the FPÖ, the BZÖ emphasised its preparedness and capability to take over government responsibility. In order to secure the desperately needed basic mandate for the BZÖ in his province, the Carinthian Governor Haider tried to mobilise anti‐Slovenian fears among the German‐speaking population by refusing to put up more bilingual local signs in mixed communities (he placed advertisements in newspapers announcing ‘Carinthia will become mono‐lingual’) (see also <b>Issues in national politics</b>). The BZÖ's campaign lost momentum when the most popular member of the party's government team, the Minister of Justice Karin Gastinger, announced her departure from the party a few days before the elections. Since her inauguration in June 2004, Gastinger had gained a reputation as a competent government member, who never surrendered unconditionally to the party line. She declared that the BZÖ proposal to expel 300,000 foreigners (which was, however, public knowledge since June) as the principal motive for her resignation.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ‘new’ (or ‘rump’) FPÖ under its chairman Heinz‐Christian Strache, hitherto chairman of the Viennese party branch, copied the traditional campaign issues of the ‘old’ party (during its opposition years under chairman Haider): immigration, criminality and security. Two of its most prominent slogans were ‘Daham (dialect for ‘at home’) instead of Islam’ and ‘German instead of understanding nothing’. The FPÖ advocated the expulsion of criminal asylum‐seekers and those unwilling to integrate themselves. Furthermore, it wanted to exclude foreigners from social benefits such as those for families, and to close the borders to new immigrants. To underline its anti‐foreigner policy, the FPÖ, like the BZÖ, was unmistakably opposed to the accession of Turkey to the European Union (the negotiations had started in October 2005). The chairman of the Jewish Community (<i>Israelitische Kultusgemeinde</i>) in Vienna warned the electorate that a vote for the FPÖ would mean a vote for a party whose background is ‘extreme right wing bordering on national socialist’.
         </p>
         
         <p>The biggest opposition party, the SPÖ, suffered from the modest popularity of its top candidate. While the incumbent Chancellor Schüssel was supported by 29 per cent of the respondents in a representative survey, only 16 per cent preferred SPÖ chairman Alfred Gusenbauer as government chief. The SPÖ's campaign concentrated on social issues and stressed the alleged ‘social coldness’ of the ÖVP. Using harsh slogans (‘Stop lying! The country needs new fairness’), it vehemently attacked Schüssel in television spots and newspaper advertisements for broken promises of full employment, tax reductions, secure pensions and modernisation of the education system. Instead, the SPÖ promised to introduce a basic income, reduce youth unemployment by 50 per cent, increase pensions, eliminate the ‘two‐classes’ health‐care system, lift tuition fees for students and stop the purchase of interceptor planes (the so‐called ‘Euro‐fighters’). Political opponents reproached the Social Democrats for making excessive promises, without pondering too much how to finance them.</p>
         
         <p>The SPÖ denied any involvement in the BAWAG scandal, but in contrast to previous elections did not reserve seats for leading trade unionists on its candidate list. Accusations that they had received illegal party financing by the BAWAG were dismissed by the Social Democrats as dirty campaigning, organised by the ÖVP; public prosecutors investigating the case were blamed for doing the ÖVP's job, politicians repeating the accusations were sued. At the same time, the SPÖ offered a parliamentary seat for the chairman of the Liberal Forum, obviously in order to broaden its electoral appeal. The Liberals, who had split from the FPÖ in 1993 because of its anti‐foreigner and anti‐EU stance, were thrown out of parliament in 1999. The SPÖ offer triggered heavy intra‐party criticisms in the Liberal Party, which prompted media commentators to speak of the final self‐dissolution of the party.</p>
         
         <p>The second opposition party, the Greens, relied on their party chairman, the university professor of economics Alexander van der Bellen, as their top candidate. Their campaign was focused on the fights against poverty (proposing the introduction of a basic income of €800 per month) and against gender discrimination. Furthermore, they wanted to increase the use of renewable energy and had a new education policy (introducing comprehensive schools for all pupils aged 6–14). Like the SPÖ, the Greens announced they would abolish tuition fees for students and stop the purchase of the Euro‐fighters.</p>
         
         <p>The list of MEP Hans‐Peter Martin tried to address protest voters by criticising the unresponsiveness and collusion of traditional party politics. He also wanted to strengthen direct democracy (by holding obligatory referendums when 500,000 people signed a citizen initiative). The Communists (<i>Kommunistische Partei Österreichs</i>, KPÖ) called for a redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor (through a basic income of €1,300 per month), the abolition of the national army and voting rights for foreigners. However, right from the start, it was clear that they had no chance of surmounting the 4 per cent threshold for entering parliament.
         </p>
         
         <p>The question of primary interest for public and media was who would win the elections. After the BAWAG scandal broke out, the SPÖ, hitherto leading in opinion polls, fell behind the ÖVP, which constantly lay between 2 and 4 per cent ahead. In the end, the SPÖ won the election – although, compared to the previous election in 2002, it also lost (−1.2) and, in taking 35.3 per cent, it received only 1 per cent more than the ÖVP. One of the major reasons for the defeat of the ÖVP, which lost 8 per cent of the vote, was the (by Austrian standards) low voter turnout. Presumably as a result of the ‘dirty’ campaigns of all parties (except the Greens), voter turnout declined from 84.3 per cent in 2002 to 78.5 per cent, and reached its lowest point since 1945. The ÖVP only mobilised 72 per cent of its 2002 voters, while 172,000 of them stayed at home. The SPÖ was at least able to bring 80 per cent of its 2002 voters to the polls, but it also lost 143,000 voters. In addition, 26 per cent of the voters changed their preference and voted for another party than they had in 2002; it was above all the Social Democrats who profited from this. Most of the new FPÖ voters, as well as those of the Greens, moved over from the ÖVP (<span title=""><a href="#b8" id="#b8R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">SORA 2006b</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The second question that the media highlighted continuously was the ‘race’ between the FPÖ and the Greens for third place. Both parties stood for opposite positions in many policy fields (especially immigration), and the question of who would cross the target line first was attributed high symbolic value. Finally, the Greens, who achieved their best result (11.05 per cent) in the history of national general elections, got 532 votes more than the FPÖ. The latter, however, was satisfied that with 11.04 per cent support, it almost won three times as many votes as its rival within the ‘Freedomite’ camp, the BZÖ.</p>
         
         <p>The number of parties to be represented in the new parliament was relevant as it had a major impact on the coalition options after the elections. The BZÖ (until the elections, the ÖVP's coalition partner) had not been able to build up an effective organisation on the ground, and remained concentrated on its members in government and parliament. It did not succeed in getting the direct mandate it hoped to win in the province of Carinthia. However, with 4.1 per cent nationwide, it was able – just – to surpass the threshold for representation (4 per cent). The List Martin (2.8 per cent) and the Communists (1 per cent) did not play a significant role.</p>
         
         <p>The voting motives for the parties varied. According to the (ÖVP‐aligned) Fessel‐GfK Institute, 43 per cent of the ÖVP voters wanted to prevent the installation of a ‘red‐green’ (SPÖ‐Green) government. Chancellor Schüssel, on whom the party's election campaign had focused, was a decisive factor for only a quarter of the ÖVP voters (<i>Wiener Zeitung</i>, 3 October 2006). Contrary to ÖVP hopes, the Social Democrats did not suffer much from the BAWAG scandal. According to the (independent) SORA Institute, 55 per cent of trade union members supported the SPÖ. As a matter of fact, the SPÖ won the issue competition; measures against unemployment – in particular youth unemployment (86 per cent), the creation of jobs (84 per cent) and the security of pensions (80 per cent) were the most important issues for the voters, and also the most important motives to vote for the SPÖ. FPÖ voters were mainly attracted by the party's restrictive immigration policy (60 per cent) and its position against Turkish EU accession (24 per cent). Likewise, its anti‐foreigner stance was the key motive for most BZÖ voters, though to a lesser degree than for the FPÖ voters (33 per cent); Haider himself was deemed important by 22 per cent of the BZÖ voters. So, the 2006 elections proved, once again, that parties relying primarily on anti‐foreigner or anti‐European attitudes appeal to around 15 per cent of Austrian voters. For Green voters, ecology (42 per cent) was by far the most important issue (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">SORA 2006a</a></span>).

         <p>Until the end of the year, party negotiations to form a new government could not be finished. Neither a resumption of the ÖVP‐BZÖ coalition nor a SPÖ‐Green coalition could command a parliamentary majority. An extension of the ÖVP‐BZÖ coalition to include the FPÖ seemed politically unfeasible because of the recent split between FPÖ and BZÖ and the continuing personal friction between the leaders of both parties. Moreover, representatives of the ÖVP during the election campaign denounced the (new) FPÖ as bunch of hooligans unfit for government. Besides, Chancellor and ÖVP Chairman Wolfgang Schüssel would have had major problems in publicly justifying the renewal of a centre‐right coalition after the recent FPÖ/BZÖ turmoil. A coalition with BZÖ and/or FPÖ had also been ruled out by the Social Democrats.</p>
         
         <p>Thus, in spite of the fact that SPÖ and ÖVP had savagely attacked each other in their campaigns, the election results left them virtually no other alternative than to form a coalition with each other – a coalition that had, after all, governed the country from 1945–1966 and from 1987–2000. The ÖVP's negotiation team was led by party chairman and Chancellor Schüssel, in spite of the fact that he was generally regarded as the biggest ‘loser’ of the election. Schüssel had been one of the leading party figures responsible for controversial government policies since 2000. His nomination could not be taken as signal that his party was in the mood to compromise. Not surprisingly, the initial rounds of negotiation between the two parties displayed the expected policy differences over Euro‐fighters, tuition fees for students, tax reduction, basic income, the comprehensive school system, financing healthcare, budget consolidation and so on.</p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP made it clear from the beginning that it would not take part in a government that would pursue a political programme harking back to the 1970s when an SPÖ single‐party government ruled the country following Keynesian concepts, leaving behind high budget deficits. The ÖVP argued that the SPÖ could hardly expect to implement ‘100 per cent socialism’ with just 1 per cent more of the votes. It presented calculations that a realisation of the SPÖ demands would cost €5.5 billion. Allegedly, the majority of party functionaries repudiated a ‘grand coalition’ with the Social Democrats. On the other hand, two powerful constituent organisations of the party – the Business League and the Farmers' League – were afraid of the party going into opposition. The public primarily blamed the ÖVP team for the lack of progress in the negotiations; at the end of October, 42 per cent of the respondents to a poll had a ‘good impression’ of the SPÖ team, and only 23 per cent of the ÖVP team (<i>Der Standard</i>, 27 October 2006).
         </p>
         
         <p>The coalition negotiations were not speeded up by the fact that on 30 October the SPÖ, together with Greens and FPÖ, installed two parliamentary committees in order to investigate the Euro‐fighter purchase and the BAWAG scandal (see <b>Issues in national politics</b>) – a move not likely to build trust with the ÖVP, whose party executive decided to suspend the coalition negotiations on the day of the setting‐up of the committees. A few days later, Party Chairman Schüssel announced that his party would continue the coalition negotiations only after the end of the parliamentary investigations (i.e., after four months at the earliest).
         </p>
         
         <p>Federal President Heinz Fischer (SPÖ) and the most widely read daily tabloid, the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>, were strictly against new elections, and supported a SPÖ‐ÖVP coalition and urged the ÖVP to return to the negotiation table. At the end of October, according to opinion polls, 69 per cent of Austrians favoured a SPÖ‐ÖVP coalition, 10 per cent a ÖVP‐FPÖ‐BZÖ coalition and 8 per cent a SPÖ minority government; however, while 83 per cent of the SPÖ sympathisers preferred a grand coalition, only 61 per cent of the ÖVP sympathisers did so (<i>Der Standard</i>, 4 November 2006).
         </p>
         
         <p>On 20 November, the SPÖ and ÖVP restarted their negotiations − after the ÖVP had realised that its strategy (no coalition negotiations as long as the parliamentary investigations were ongoing) was eroding its public support, and after the SPÖ had made commitments respecting bankers' discretion (referring to the bank investigative committee), as well as to the principle ‘<i>pacta sunt servanda</i>’ and an effective air defence (referring to the Euro‐fighters). In addition, the two party chairmen agreed to cooperate in parliamentary business – that is, no party would take part in majorities to overrule the other (with respect to the investigative committees, this meant that each party should be able to invite the witnesses it preferred). More generally, they agreed that future government cooperation should be ‘based on what had already been achieved’, thereby excluding a major reversal of policies of the former ÖVP‐FPÖ(‐BZÖ) government.
         </p>
         
         <p>However, the negotiations still were not based on mutual trust. The ÖVP accused the SPÖ of leading parallel talks with the Greens and the FPÖ aimed at building a coalition or at least an SPÖ minority government tolerated by the other two parties. These rumours continued even though the Greens declared – at least initially – that they regarded a minority government as only a provisional solution because of its inherently unstable character, and that they objected on principle to sitting at a table with FPÖ or BZÖ representatives to draw up a long‐term agreement to support such a government. The SPÖ, on the other hand, constantly accused the ÖVP of trying to form a coalition with the FPÖ and BZÖ, however unlikely such an arrangement seemed. Indeed, many found it difficult to see how the incumbent Chancellor Schüssel would serve as Vice‐Chancellor under a Chancellor Gusenbauer, whose leadership competence and reform‐mindedness he disputed. These reciprocal charges continued even after 13 December, when SPÖ and ÖVP agreed on a timetable to finish the coalition negotiations by 8 January so that the new government could be sworn in by the Federal President on 11 January.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>During the first half of 2006, Austria held the presidency of the EU. The Austrian presidency was rated satisfactory, though not outstanding. It succeeded in concluding the negotiations about the services directive aimed at opening up Europe's services sector to cross‐border competition, but it was not able to end the deadlock regarding the European Constitution and further enlargement of the EU. With respect to the accession of Turkey, the Austrian government, supported by public opinion and by all opposition parties except the Greens, continued its restrictive course and demanded clear criteria for the ‘absorption capacity’ of the EU. The FPÖ tried to profit from the low public estimation of EU membership and started a citizen initiative (<i>Volksbegehren</i>) under the title ‘Austria remain free!’ in March. The initiative demanded that Austria's neutral status should be upgraded to a constitutional principle and that both a European constitution and the accession of Turkey should be submitted to a national referendum before coming into effect. Some 258,281 people (i.e., 4.3 per cent of the electorate) signed the initiative, making it the twenty‐first most successful (out of 32 initiatives) since 1945. As expected, the initiative triggered no political effects: only if there are more than 100,000 signatures is the lower house of Parliament (the <i>Nationalrat</i>) obliged to put the issue on its agenda, and even then it does not have to take any corresponding action.
         </p>
         
         <p>Austria's relationship with the EU was also strained by the issue of foreign students at Austrian universities. In 2005, a law restricting access to those students who had the right to study in their home country was repealed by the European Court of Justice as a violation of the non‐discrimination principle (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1048–1049). The new law made getting a place at the university in eight subjects dependent on good school grades, an entrance examination or a successfully completed entrance phase, but it could not prohibit foreign students (above all from Germany) applying for more than half of the places at the three universities offering medicine. A quota system reserving 75 per cent of the places to Austrian students was therefore introduced for medicine and dentistry in August. This system ‘saved’ Austrian students: on the basis of the entrance exams at the medical universities of Vienna and Innsbruck, only 46 per cent of the places would otherwise have gone to Austrian applicants in the academic year 2006–2007.
         </p>
         
         <p>The issue dominating the news headlines throughout the year, however, was the so‐called ‘BAWAG scandal’, which broke out in March. The BAWAG, a bank owned by the SPÖ‐dominated Austrian Trade Union Federation (<i>Österreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund</i>, ÖGB), had received bad media coverage since October 2005, when its credit of €425 million to the world's biggest brokerage house situated in the United States (Refco) became known. The money had been transferred spontaneously over a weekend − just a few days before Refco's chief executive had to announce its insolvency and was arrested for allegedly manipulating recent balance sheets. Political opponents and media asked why a Social Democrat‐oriented bank did deals with a company known for the kind of ‘locust capitalism’ so fervently criticised by trade unions and SPÖ politicians. They used the case to demonstrate the ideological confusion and economic incompetence of the ‘left’ camp. An investigation by the Financial Market Supervisory Agency (FMA), which blamed the bank's executive board for lack of due diligence, led to the resignation of BAWAG's CEO. He was succeeded by Ewald Nowotny, a university professor of economics, who was an SPÖ MP from 1978 to 1999 and Vice‐President of the European Investment Bank from 1999 to 2003.
         </p>
         
         <p>In March 2006, more dubious deals done by the BAWAG were revealed, which turned the affair into a scandal and a criminal case. The bank had held shares in ill‐reputed companies on Caribbean islands, trading with fake bonds. Between 1995 and 2000, the bank had lost about €1 billion in speculative trading, even after it had been obliged to stop them officially. Moreover, the president of the ÖGB, Fritz Verzetnitsch, had signed a guarantee for the debts in order to save the bank – and his own organisation – from ruin and from a negative public image. The guarantee was secured with the strike fund of the trade unions. The decision was taken solely by Verzetnitsch and the chairman of the supervisory board of the bank (at the same time chief financial officer of the trade unions) and was kept secret – neither the rest of the supervisory board nor other owners of the bank (from 1996 until 2004, the Bavarian State Bank held 46 per cent of the shares) nor the Financial Market Supervisory Agency were informed. The ÖGB thereby violated not only the law, but also lost credibility as it used practices for which it usually criticised private companies. What is more, the responsible bank managers were not removed from their positions.</p>
         
         <p>Although the bank recovered from its state of financial emergency and did not have to use the guarantee, Verzetnitsch had to resign as ÖGB president (after 19 years in office) and was also sacked as an employee of the ÖGB (the SPÖ leadership had not been consulted before the decision). He was reproached for his failure to inform the executive board, for the debts of the organisation (amounting to more than €2.3 billion, including the debts of the BAWAG) and for the collapse of public trust. The old principle that the trade unions do not allow any of their representatives to be hounded out of their ranks by political opponents was obviously no longer valid. The fact that Verzetnitsch had resided in a luxurious penthouse on the roof of the BAWAG main building in Vienna, thereby alienating many ‘ordinary’ trade union members, contributed much to this paradigm shift.</p>
         
         <p>One week after the scandal broke, the ÖGB decided to sell the BAWAG. SPÖ Chairman Alfred Gusenbauer recommended this action to the trade unions that had owned the bank since 1922. The federation hesitated at first, but soon complied – all the more so after the bank's new management threatened to resign otherwise. When the creditors of Refco demanded US$1.3 billion from the BAWAG, the sale was in danger for some time. Finally, an extra‐judicial agreement was reached, according to which the bank had to pay €675 million. Moreover, Parliament unanimously passed a law, initiated by the governing parties, guaranteeing a €900 million public commitment for the bank. In addition, other banks agreed to contribute €450 million to the saving of the BAWAG. As a price, the ÖGB was obliged to declare its whole fortune, including its strike fund (hitherto ‘the biggest secret’ of the republic) <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the National Bank, and ÖGB and BAWAG had to sell their stakes in the National Bank to the state. The newspapers commented: ‘BAWAG solved, ÖGB disempowered’ (see <i>Der Standard</i>, 3 May 2006). Leading government members, including the Chancellor and the Finance Minister, used the opportunity to present themselves as saviours of the BAWAG and opened accounts in the bank.
         </p>
         
         <p>To help restore its image, the ÖGB decided on a number of organisational reforms. The executive board elected a new president until the next trade union congress, due in autumn 2007. Furthermore, the maximum income of leading trade unionists was limited (to €5,800 per month), the share of women in higher positions was raised from 20 to 33 per cent, and control was to be exercised by minority (i.e., non‐Social Democratic) factions in the future. However, critics observed that representatives of the ‘new’ leadership had known about or even been involved in the events leading to the near‐collapse of the trade union bank. They ducked substantial reforms to provide the trade unions with the means to cope with the challenges of a globalised economy and to restore its image. In particular, once again it proved impossible to reduce the power of the mighty sectoral branches of the ÖGB.</p>
         
         <p>The Social Democrats, whose popularity dropped back to second place behind the ÖVP in opinion polls, tried to distance themselves as far as possible from the BAWAG scandal – and partly also from the trade unions. They hinted to the fact that the Financial Market Supervisory Agency, subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, had information about the BAWAG's problems from 2001 onwards, but did not take action. Furthermore, the SPÖ parliamentary group, urged by Party Chairman Gusenbauer, decided to exclude chairmen or chairwomen of the sectoral branches of the trade unions from parliament (in the past up to a third of all Social Democratic MPs came from the trade unions). Moreover, he denied the trade unions' traditional claim to nominate the Minister for Social Security in a government with SPÖ participation. In general, the SPÖ chairman argued that his party should not be reduced to interest politics for working people.</p>
         
         <p>In December 2006, the BAWAG was sold for €3.3 billion to the American‐based Cerberus fund, enough to liquidate the debts of the ÖGB and to satisfy the American creditors of the bank. The BAWAG managers who had arranged the disastrous Caribbean trades were to go on trial, together with the chief financial officer of the ÖGB, a bank investigator and an investment banker. In September, a few weeks before the general elections, the former CEO of the BAWAG, who had escaped to France, was arrested and transferred to Austria. At the same time, former president Verzetnitsch demanded the ÖGB pay his severance award and his trade union pension. The BAWAG scandal led to the establishment of a parliamentary investigative committee after the general elections on 30 October. The committee mandate, however, referred not only to the BAWAG, but to other banks as well (notably the Raiffeisen Bank, widely regarded as close to the ÖVP). The financial market supervision, the role of the Ministry of Finance, dubious deals by Austrian banks in Eastern Europe and allegations of illegal party financing would also be scrutinised.</p>
         
         <p>On the same day, another investigative committee was set up to deal with the Euro‐fighter purchase. Here the mandate included the investigation of the decision to buy the Euro‐fighters (seen by some experts as too expensive and too advanced for the needs of the Austrian armed services), the costs of the purchase (estimated to lie somewhere in the region of €2–5 billion), lobbying activities of the company constructing the Euro‐fighters (EADS), party financing, the influence of personal economic interests of government members and the possibility of bailing out of the (secret) treaty. Both committees were decided on by SPÖ, Greens and FPÖ− against the votes of the two parties forming the (now caretaker) government, ÖVP and BZÖ. The latter criticised the ‘political’ motives behind their establishment and the potential damage to Austria's image in the financial world.</p>
         
         <p>Another conflict that dominated the news in 2006 referred to the setting‐up of bilingual (German and Slovenian) local signs in the province of Carinthia. The Constitutional Court had ruled in 2001 that the State Treaty of Vienna (1955) restoring national independence required that in all mixed districts with more than 10 per cent of Slovenian people (instead of 25 per cent as before) bilingual signs had be set up (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1050–1051). Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, former FPÖ party chairman and, since April 2005, party chairman of the newly founded BZÖ, continued his obstruction after the Court demanded that bilingual signs be erected in another two municipalities. He removed the existing monolingual signs, just to re‐erect them a metre away. Haider argued that he had never violated the law and that it was for the Carinthian people and the (national) parliament – and not some ‘politically‐minded’ judges – to decide on the matter. When Haider called the Constitutional Court a ‘hoax band’, whose rulings could consequently be ignored, he was severely criticised. Even constitutional lawyers, however, suggested that the Court's decision was not unproblematic: some questioned its competence to verify the abrogated provisions and to define a 10 per cent limit in the first place; others noted that it expressed a deliberate policy to protect minority rights. None doubted, however, that the ruling had to be implemented.
         </p>
         
         <p>In spite of the fact that minority rights do not fall under the competence of the provinces, Haider organised a plebiscite on the issue in 18 municipalities in order to back up his claim. In May 2006, Chancellor and ÖVP Party Chairman Wolfgang Schüssel (whose party was still in a coalition with Haider's BZÖ at the federal level) presented a compromise paper based on a ‘consensus conference’ in May 2005. It stipulated 158 signs (i.e., 81 new ones), but did not include a so‐called ‘opening clause’, which would have enabled more signs in the future. The paper was rejected by Haider and one of the two Carinthian Homeland organisations. Finally, in June, the two governing parties, ÖVP and BZÖ, agreed on a proposal for a constitutional law that provided for 141 signs and included an opening clause. All Carinthian parties supported the proposal. However, as new signs would have been subject to approval by the municipality and the province, constitutional lawyers regarded the opening clause (which reduced minority to petition rights) as not in line with the State Treaty. As a result, all (three) Slovenian organisations as well as the SPÖ, whose consent would have been required to change the constitution, refused to agree. Haider continued his provocation of the Constitutional Court in August when he replaced bilingual signs with monolingual (German) ones supplemented by small Slovenian signs. He declared that the issue could only be resolved when a native language census was carried out. His underlying motive seemed to be to keep the issue on the political agenda in Carinthia and to secure his Alliance the basic mandate it so desperately needed to enter parliament in the forthcoming general elections.</p>
