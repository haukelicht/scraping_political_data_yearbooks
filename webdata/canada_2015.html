         <p>In 2015, Canadian politics was dominated by a federal election. It was the first to be held on a fixed date and was preceded by one of the country's longest campaigns. With Canada's currency declining in value as the price of oil continued to fall, Canadians defeated the governing Conservative Party but declined to put the official opposition New Democratic Party (NDP) in power in their stead. The election saw a massive increase in voter turnout and raised the Liberals from third party status to majority government.</p>

            <p>In addition to the national election, elections were held in three of the ten provinces and Conservative parties failed to win any of them. Most dramatic was the defeat of a long‐term Conservative regime in the oil‐producing province of Alberta. The Conservative Party had governed since 1971, but falling natural resource revenue and a split in the right of centre vote between the Conservatives and the provincially based Wildrose Party allowed the NDP to win their first victory in the province.</p>
            
            <p>In Canada's smallest province, Prince Edward Island, the Liberals were returned to power with a reduced majority. The party changed leaders before the election and their new leader became the first openly gay man to lead a party to victory in Canada. The Green Party also managed to win its first seat in the province.</p>
            
            <p>The election in Newfoundland and Labrador followed the federal election and continued federal trends. After nearly two decades and three successive losses to the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberal Party rebounded and eclipsed the NDP to replace the Progressive Conservatives in the provincial government.</p>

            <p>The long federal election campaign began with a virtual tie in support among the three major parties and uncertainty about which party would win. The Conservatives were hopeful that the lengthy 78‐day campaign might allow them to benefit from their edge in fundraising and win a fourth consecutive election.</p>

            <p>The Liberals and New Democrats were led by new leaders while Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper was a veteran of four previous elections. Thomas Mulcair became NDP leader in 2012 following the death of Jack Layton, who in 2011 had led the party to its highest ever share of seats. The Liberals were led by Justin Trudeau, the son of a former Prime Minister, and after his election as leader the party surged in the polls. Both of the other major parties attempted to counter his popularity by raising concerns about whether Trudeau was ready to assume power.</p>
            
            <p>The Conservative government was nearing ten years in power and was increasingly unpopular – with about three‐fifths of the electorate telling pollsters it was time for a change. Even so, the possibility of vote splits afforded by the single‐member plurality electoral system offered the government some hope of re‐election. The opposition parties battled over which of them was best positioned to replace the Conservatives. The New Democrats, enjoying official opposition for the first time, presented a cautious campaign in which they promised balanced budgets and a moderate approach. The Trudeau‐led Liberals tried to outflank the NDP on the left by committing to running deficits to stimulate the economy and build the country's infrastructure. Trudeau also exceeded expectations in the leaders’ debates mitigating concerns that he was not ready to govern.</p>
            
            <p>The Conservatives attempted to make cultural and identity issues prominent by seeking to ban women from wearing a Niqab while taking citizenship oaths. This led to divisive discussions about limitations in other interactions with government but proved popular with the electorate, particularly in the province of Quebec. The NDP's opposition to this position especially hurt its support in Quebec, which had provided the bulk of the party's seats in 2011, leaving the Liberals positioned as the clear alternative nationally.</p>
            
            <p>The Liberals benefited from a 7 per cent increase in voter turnout and increased their popular vote by more than twenty percentage points. The party won every seat in the four Atlantic provinces and, for the first time since 1980, a majority of seats in the predominantly French‐speaking province of Quebec. This came largely at the expense of the NDP. The recovery in Quebec combined with 80 Liberal seats in the largest province of Ontario and 23 seats in the four western provinces provided the party with representation far beyond its 39.5 per cent share of the popular vote and allowed it to easily form a single‐party majority government. The Liberals promised that this would be the last election fought under the system, raising questions about how future representation would be determined.</p>
            
            <p>Both the Conservatives and New Democrats suffered substantial declines in vote share, but the Conservative Party managed to hold on to almost 32 per cent of the vote, leaving it well positioned as the official opposition and, with the quick resignation of Prime Minister Harper, preparing for a new leadership election. The separatist Bloc Québécois, running only in Quebec, more than doubled its seat count to ten despite attracting a smaller vote share than 2011. This left it just short of official party status. The Green Party again managed to see their party leader elected to parliament despite a modest decline in vote share. No independents or representatives of other parties were returned to the legislature.</p>

         <p>The resignation in February 2015 of Foreign Minister John Baird and modest changes in cabinet raised questions about the electoral prospects of the Conservatives. These questions became more pointed as other prominent MPs, including Justice Minister Peter McKay, the last pre‐ merger leader of the old Progressive Conservative Party, indicated that they would not seek re‐election. Baird was replaced in Foreign Affairs by Rob Nicholson, who moved over from the Defence portfolio. Nicholson was succeeded in that role by Employment and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney who retained responsibility for Multiculturalism while his former duties were taken over by Pierre Polievere, the Minister of State for Democratic Reform.</p>

         <p>The election of a majority Liberal government produced an entirely new cabinet and the new Prime Minister generated international attention by appointing an equal number of men and women to his cabinet. Women had always been under‐represented in Canadian cabinets and the Prime Minister's indication that equality was needed ‘Because it's 2015’ garnered significant public approval. Trudeau appointed an ethnically diverse cabinet that balanced Canada's regional interests with 11 members from Ontario, seven from Quebec, four from Atlantic Canada and eight from the western provinces in which the Liberals were electorally weaker. Former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion took on the Foreign Affairs portfolio and five other MPs with previous cabinet experience also entered the new cabinet. The new cabinet was smaller in size than the outgoing Conservative ministry and included rookie MPs in key positions such as Finance and Justice.</p>

         <p>With a general election looming, no by‐elections were held and pre‐election changes to party representation were modest. One member shifted from independent to Forces et Démocratie (which disappeared following the 2015 election). In addition, one NDP member moved to the Green Party and another to independent status. One Conservative became an independent while another crossed the floor to join the Liberals. None of those who changed party status were re‐elected.</p>

         <p>The Bloc Québécois changed leaders shortly before the 2015 election campaign. Mario Beaulieu, the controversial leader described as a hard‐line separatist, resigned amid doubts regarding his electoral prospects. The party called on former leader Gilles Duceppe who returned without a formal leadership election. Duceppe resigned after failing to win a seat in the election and was replaced by an interim leader. Stephen Harper stepped down as Conservative leader after losing office and was also replaced by an interim leader.</p>

         <p>The election and preparation for it dominated Canadian politics. The Conservatives delivered on a promise and in April introduced a balanced budget. However, in order to achieve this goal, funds from the sale of General Motors shares were needed. Targeted tax breaks outlined in the budget would be a key part of the Conservative election campaign but seemed to attract little new support while proposals by both the NDP and Liberals to raise some taxes generated little hostility. The declining price of oil, the fall in the value of the Canadian dollar and concerns over contractions in gross domestic product raised issues about the Conservative record of economic management that plagued them throughout the year. The Conservatives continued their policy of negotiating new trade deals and announced, during the election campaign, agreement on the Trans‐Pacific Partnership among 12 Pacific Rim countries.</p>
         
         <p>Conservative measure to deal with terrorism included the controversial Bill C 51 which made encouraging terrorist acts a crime, raised issues about sharing terrorist propaganda and personal information, and permitted more arrests without warrants. This legislation produced different reactions among opposition parties: the NDP rejected it completely while the Liberals supported it, but promised reforms if elected. Similarly, Conservative legislation stripping citizenship from immigrants convicted of terrorism offences divided the government from the opposition, as did approaches to the processing of Syrian refugee applications.</p>
         
         <p>Aboriginal issues attracted attention as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ended years of study on the impact of residential schools and released a report with almost 100 recommendations aimed at improving relations between the government and indigenous peoples. The NDP pledged to act on the report while the Liberals committed to move forward with each of the proposals. The Conservative response was more muted.</p>
         
         <p>The Canadian Senate continued to make news with the ongoing trial of a former Conservative Senator on fraud and breach of trust. The Liberal government announced that it would create an advisory board to make recommendations to the Prime Minister on future appointments to the indirectly elected upper house.</p>
         
         <p>Following the election the new government moved to differentiate itself from its predecessor. A clear commitment was made to addressing climate change as well as to removing Canadian bombers from the fight against Islamic State. The Liberals also pushed forward with an effort to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada.</p>
