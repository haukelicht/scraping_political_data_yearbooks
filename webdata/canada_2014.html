         <p>Canada's parliament rarely attracts international attention, but in October an armed attack generated significant coverage. While parliamentarians barricaded themselves in caucus rooms, a gunman, who had previously killed a Canadian soldier at a nearby war memorial, exchanged gunfire with security forces inside the parliament buildings before being killed himself. Issues of security, homegrown terrorism and Canada's military interventions were debated in the aftermath of this event and remained contentious as the year ended.</p>

         <p>There were no national level elections held in Canada in 2014. The next national election is scheduled for October 2015. Elections were held in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. Liberal parties won all three elections, with the Ontario Liberals holding on to power and the Quebec and New Brunswick Liberals returning to power after only one term out of office. In Ontario, the largest province, the Liberals regained majority status in the legislature after the previous election had reduced them to minority status. Kathleen Wynne, in her first election as leader, marginally increased the party's popular vote with public sector cuts a major issue in the campaign. In this polarised election her Conservative opponents promised an earlier return to a balanced budget with a programme calling for cuts in the civil service. The weaker New Democratic Party held on to the same number of seats. Ms Wynne became the first woman and the first openly gay leader to be elected as premier.</p>
         
         <p>In Quebec, Canada's second largest province and the only province with a French‐speaking majority, the separatist <i>Parti Quebecois</i> (PQ) lost power after just 18 months. This was the first time in almost 50 years that a party had not been re‐elected at least once. The PQ had expected a public endorsement of its controversial secular charter, but was seeking a new mandate because of legislative opposition to its budget plans. The election turned into a debate on the timing of a new referendum on sovereignty and it became clear that most Quebecers were wary of this development. Under a new leader, the Liberals won a comfortable majority with over 40 per cent of the popular vote. The PQ fell to 25 per cent, which is their worst showing since they first won power in 1976. The more right‐wing <i>Coalition Avenir Québec</i> (CAQ) party came close to matching the PQ in both seats and votes, while <i>Quebec Solidaire</i>, a more radical separatist party, won three seats with 8 per cent of the vote. With her defeat, Quebec Premier Pauline Marois failed to become the first woman in Canadian history to win consecutive elections.

         <p>The New Brunswick election marked the third successive election in which the incumbent government was defeated. The Liberals, under a new leader, campaigned on limiting natural gas exploitation in the province while also improving access to abortion services. New Brunswick was also challenged financially, with governments finding it difficult to balance the budget.</p>
         
         <p>In the two largest provinces the links between federal and provincial parties are weak and the results of the elections are unlikely to have much of an impact on federal politics. The defeat of the PQ, however, followed a devastating defeat in 2011 of the <i>Bloc Quebecois</i>, a federal party that promoted Quebec independence.

         <p>Minor cabinet changes occurred in March 2014 when long‐serving Finance Minister Jim Flaherty resigned, indicating that he wished to return to the private sector. He had earlier expressed some misgivings about proceeding with tax changes relating to income‐splitting between couples, but did not suggest that this was a factor in his departure. He had served as Finance Minister since the Conservatives were first elected in 2006 and was one of the more popular and well known ministers. Flaherty died less than a month later and ensuing comments revealed the respect with which he was regarded by even opposition parties. Flaherty was replaced at Finance by Joe Oliver, another Ontario MP, who moved over from the Natural Resources portfolio. Oliver was replaced by Greg Rickford, who left his position as Minister of State for Science and Technology. Completing the change was the entry into cabinet of Ontario MP Ed Holder as Minister of State for Science and Technology.</p>

         <p>With no general election in 2014, changes to party representation were based on the outcome of by‐elections and decisions of MPs to change their status or parties to suspend them. Two Liberals were suspended from the caucus following allegations of sexual harassment made by MPs from another party. Both members sat as independents as it became clear that there were no parliamentary procedures in place to deal with such issues. The Liberals were the only party to improve their legislative representation as a result of by‐elections. The party was able to retain both seats in which one of their incumbents resigned and they were able to take one seat away from the NDP.</p>

         <p>The New Democrats saw a decline of four members in 2014. One of their members resigned to seek election in a municipal election and, as noted above, the party was unable to retain the seat in the ensuing by‐election. One member left the party to sit as an independent after expressing unhappiness with party leader Tom Mulcair's leadership style and the party's position on the Middle East. Another member was suspended from caucus following criminal charges relating to falsely reporting a crime. Finally, a member left the party to sit as part of a new political grouping. Party reports indicated the member was unlikely to secure re‐nomination.</p>
         
         <p>As 2014 began, the <i>Bloc Quebecois</i> had only four MPs and by year's end the party was reduced to just two. The departure of two MPs followed the election of a new hard‐line separatist leader. One member left to sit as an independent before eventually joining with an NDP defector in a grouping called ‘<i>Forces et Democratie</i>’. Another member, who was runner‐up in the leadership race, decided to sit as an independent as a result of unresolved differences with the new leader.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives lost four members, one through death and three others because of resignations. The party retained the three seats in which by‐elections were held, but one resignation came too late in the year for a by‐election to be scheduled. This resignation followed the member's conviction on charges relating to election expenses. The member had indicated a reluctance to resign, but stepped down when it became clear that his colleagues were going to vote to suspend him. That riding was the only one to be vacant on 31 December.</p>
         
         <p>Party standings in the unelected Senate looked like they would change dramatically when Liberal leader Justin Trudeau indicated in January that Senators would not be able to sit in the Liberal caucus. Eventually, the Senators appointed as Liberals had their status recognised in the upper chamber. Changes in the composition were limited to the departure of those who had reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 and the failure of the Prime Minister to appoint new members. With the setback to the Prime Minister's plans for Senate reform, it appeared that he was going to leave the appointment of new members alone for the time being.</p>

         <p>In 2014, Prime Minister Stephen Harper passed Brian Mulroney as the longest serving Conservative Prime Minister since Sir John A. Macdonald, the country's first leader. The year nonetheless proved challenging for the Prime Minister. The courts played a major role in Conservative difficulties, with the Supreme Court ending Prime Minister Harper's plans for reforming Canada's unelected upper house (the Senate) by indicating that substantial provincial support was required.</p>

         <p>The Canadian Senate continued to attract political attention with Liberal leader Justin Trudeau beginning 2014 by removing all Liberal Senators from the combined parliamentary caucus. The Senators eventually reconstituted themselves under a somewhat different Liberal banner, but the actions symbolised the Liberal desire to focus on the Conservative failure to change the Senate as well as the scandals that had engulfed the unelected upper chamber.</p>
         
         <p>The Supreme Court placed the Conservatives on the defensive by rejecting the Prime Minister's nominee for the court following a challenge relating to his eligibility. This led to criticism of the court by the Conservatives, despite the fact that most of the current court was appointed by the Harper government. Court decisions relating to the campaign activities of Conservative workers and MPs also created problems for the governing party.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives continued their strategy of introducing omnibus legislation relating to the budget that involves changes to multiple bills, but the outcry over this policy seems to be diminishing. The budget itself stressed Canada's outperformance of other G‐7 countries in job creation since 2009, as well as the country's favourable credit rating and debt‐to‐GDP rating, and continued to forecast a return to a balanced budget by 2015. Pipelines to move oil from Alberta to the coasts as well as the United States continued to be contentious and little progress was made in advancing their construction. A sharp decline in energy prices near the end of the year raised questions about the stability of Canada's economic outlook.</p>
         
         <p>Conservative efforts to improve the First Nations education system resulted in the resignation of the leader of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN). The government announced a plan to spend CAN$1.9 billion on education as part of a programme endorsed by the AFN chief. When most AFN members rejected the plan, the chief resigned, forcing a change in the movement's leadership and leading the federal government to withdraw its plan.</p>
         
         <p>Measures to change the rules governing Canadian elections embroiled the government in significant controversy and criticism from the academic community, as well as opposition parties. Concerns revolved around changes to financing, voter identification and the role of the independent Chief Electoral Office. More than 150 Canadian political scientists signed a letter suggesting that the Fair Elections Act (bill C 23) would damage Canadian democracy, and almost two dozen international scholars suggested that Canada's democratic reputation would be damaged by the legislation. The government eventually responded with a number of compromises that left the opposition parties unsatisfied and questions about the partisan nature of changes to electoral rules unresolved. Fortunately for the government, the general public seemed largely uninterested in the issue.</p>
         
         <p>A leadership race within the <i>Bloc Quebecois</i> resulted in substantial acrimony within the party. Mario Beaulieu, described as a hard‐line separatist, defeated <i>Bloc</i> MP André Bellavance 53 per cent to 47 per cent in an all‐member vote in June. Beaulieu had no caucus support and proceeded to critique previous leaders for not accomplishing much in advancing the separatist cause. Even more controversially, in his acceptance speech he used a phrase associated with the FLQ, a group associated with the assassination of a Quebec cabinet minister in 1970. Two of the four MPs left the party, previous leaders criticised Beaulieu and other party members also resigned. This, combined with the defeat of the separatist PQ government, raised questions about the strength of the separatist movement.
         </p>
         
         <p>Provincial politics continued to attract substantial political attention with the resignations under pressure of sitting premiers in Newfoundland and Labrador and Alberta. Combined with the defeat of Pauline Marois in the Quebec election, the number of provinces led by women fell from five to two. In Manitoba, the sitting NDP premier faced a cabinet revolt in which five prominent cabinet ministers called on him to resign. The ministers resigned from cabinet, but the premier faced down the opposition by agreeing to a leadership election in the new year.</p>
         
         <p>The leadership of Toronto, Canada's largest city, was much in the news as controversial mayor Rob Ford sought re‐election in 2014. The stories of drug and alcohol abuse combined with health challenges eventually led to Mayor Ford withdrawing from the mayoral race in favour of his brother Doug. John Tory, a former Progressive Conservative leader in Ontario, won the election, defeating Ford and former federal NDP MP Olivia Chow. Rob Ford returned to the council as an ordinary member and speculated about a future mayoral run, but international and national interest in Toronto politics was much diminished.</p>
         
         <p>The invasion of parliament by an armed gunman attracted substantial attention and was rated as the country's top news story for 2014. The issues of homegrown terrorism and the relationship with Canadian foreign policy generated significant controversy.</p>
