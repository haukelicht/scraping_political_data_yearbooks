         <p>Regional elections in autumn in Styria and Vienna were important to both government parties. The goal of conflict avoidance led the government to postpone ministerial negotiations and the presentation of the budget bill to parliament until after the regional elections. This helped to preserve harmony in government and drew the wrath of the opposition parties instead (see also below).</p>

         <p>In January the goverment announced that it would postpone the introduction of the budget bill in parliament to December, even though presentation is constitutionally prescribed to occur no later than 22 October. In defence of its decision, the government pointed to the financial turmoil in Europe which made reliable calculation of budget figures impossible and argued that it needed more time to negotiate administrative reforms that would accompany the budget bill. The three oppposition parties (Freedom Party, Greens and Alliance for the Future of Austria) criticised the government, claiming that the SPÖ and ÖVP only wanted to prevent the negative impact of expected tax increases and cuts in social spending from influencing regional election outcomes. When the government finally introduced the budget bill in parliament in November, the opposition expressed its anger by various means of filibuster. Plenary speaking time in the national parliament has been limited since the 1990s. However, limits do not apply to committee deliberations and a Green MP in the budget committee gave a marathon speech of almost 13 hours. The opposition parties introduced numerous amendments, asked for separate votes and roll call votes which stretched the final passage of the budget bill in the last session before Christmas for many hours.</p>

                     Notes: <sup>a</sup> The members of the <i>Bundesrat</i> are delegated by the provincial parliaments (<i>Landtage</i>) on the basis of the results of the preceding provincial elections. The date of change in the <i>Bundesrat</i> composition refers to the <i>Landtag</i> elections rather than the inauguration of the new members, which may be delayed for some weeks. The <i>Landtag</i> elections in Burgenland, held on 30 May, had no effect on the composition of the <i>Bundesrat</i>. The Greens lost one MP shortly before the regional elections in the autumn. On 1 September, a Green <i>Bundesrat</i> declared his allegiance to the Social Democrats. The Green <i>Land</i> party had denied him re‐nomination as <i>Bundesrat</i> candidate for the upcoming Vienna <i>Land</i> elections whereas the Social Democrats promised and provided him with one of their seats. <sup>b</sup> The two BZÖ members in the <i>Bundesrat</i> were from the Carinthian <i>Land</i> party organisation which split off from the BZÖ federal party in January 2010 (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2010</a></span>: 849). The <i>Land</i> party re‐adopted the label it formerly had as a <i>Land</i> party organisation of the FPÖ, <i>Die Freiheitlichen in Kärnten</i> (The Freedomites in Carinthia), and chose the acronym FPK. After less than a year of autonomous existence, the leader of the federal FPÖ, Heinz‐Christian Strache, and the leader of the FPK, Uwe Scheuch, announced on 24 November that the FPK's MPs in the lower and upper chamber were joining the FPÖ parliamentary group. Since December 2010 they are registered as FPÖ MPs, raising the size of its <i>Bundesrat</i> delegation to nine seats.

         <p>In 2010 a presidential election and three regional elections took place in Austria. First came the presidential election on 25 April which brought the expected clear result. The incumbent president Heinz Fischer, a Social Democrat, won a second term of office with 79.3 per cent of the valid votes. Fischer, who had been elected as the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) in his first term, ran as an Independent for the second term and stressed his nonpartisan exercise of office. Electoral turnout was very low at 53.6 per cent and the share of invalid votes of 7.1 per cent was unusually high. A number of factors account for this pattern. For the first time, voting was noncompulsory nationwide. Fischer had faced only weak competition by two candidates from the right of the political spectre. The Freedom Party nominated Barbara Rosenkranz – a member of the <i>Land</i> government of Lower Austria and well‐known representative of the party's far right. She won 15.2 per cent of the votes. The second candidate was Rudolf Gering – a businessman and leader of a tiny extra‐parliamentary party, the Christian Party of Austria (CPÖ). He obtained 5.4 per cent of the votes. The other parties represented in the national parliament, the People's Party (ÖVP), the Greens and the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) did not field a candidate. The Greens endorsed Fischer after he gave a presentation at a party hearing. ÖVP and BZÖ gave no official endorsement. Prominent members of the People's Party (ÖVP) advised their voters to abstain or cast a blank vote. The <i>Land</i> governor of Lower Austria, Erwin Pröll – a powerful politician in the ÖVP – had expressed an ambition to enter the race. His nephew Josef Pröll, the national party leader and vice‐chancellor in the coalition government with the SPÖ, however, declared in February that the ÖVP would not nominate a candidate. The party would have fought a costly uphill battle against the bland, but respected incumbent. In contrast to parliamentary elections there is no state refunding of campaign expenditures in presidential elections. Campaign expenditures were estimated to be about €2–2.5 million for Fischer, €1.5 million for Rosenkranz and €150,000 for Gehring.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was also fear of counter‐balancing voting behaviour in the next national elections in 2013 that would hurt the People's Party's chances of winning the federal chancellor's office if the president belonged to the ÖVP and was a relative of the party leader. Without competition from the moderate right, the FPÖ candidate seemed destined to attain a good result, but the actual share of 15 per cent of the votes for Rosenkranz was far below expectations. In interviews, she confirmed past controversial statements like proposing to abolish the law banning Nazi propaganda in Austria and doubting the existence of Holocaust gas chambers. Public criticism was intense. The Austrian cardinal and chairman of the conference of Catholic bishops called her ineligible. The editor of the tabloid <i>Neue Kronen Zeitung</i>, which had been sympathetic to her candidacy, threatened to oppose her if she did not unequivocally distance herself from the Nazi regime. She complied and signed a notarised statement during a press conference a month ahead of the election.
         </p>
         
         <p>During 2010, parliamentary elections were held in the <i>Länder</i> Burgenland, Styria and Vienna, which put three of the four <i>Land</i> governorhips held by the Social Democratic Party at stake. The <i>Land</i> governor is elected by the Diet. The election in Burgenland on 30 May was first, while the two more important ones in term of their relevance for national politics came in autumn. Burgenland belongs to the group of Austrian <i>Länder</i> whose constitution proscribes rule by Proporz government. It was ruled by a coalition of SPÖ (four cabinet seats) and ÖVP (three seats). In addition, the SPÖ controlled a majority of the seats in the <i>Land</i> diet. However, some government decisions required a 5/7th majority, giving the ÖVP veto power in the cabinet.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Burgenland election was called by the SPÖ in December 2009 – half a year before the regular end of the term – under the prextext of deadlock in government. Its coalition partner had opposed a constitutional reform bill introduced by the SPÖ. The bill intended to abolish Proporz government, the 5/7th majority requirement for cabinet decisions, reduce the size of the government from seven to five members, and the size of the diet from 36 to 34 members. It did not include the ÖVP demand of electing the <i>Land</i> governor by popular vote. The two small opposition parties in the diet – FPÖ and Greens – were both in favour of ending Proporz government, but critical of the rushed introduction of the constitutional reform bill as <i>casus belli</i> for an early election. As their votes would have been insufficient to get the bill past a two‐thirds majority hurdle, the SPÖ bill was destined to fail. The SPÖ majority sufficed, however, to call an early election and to amend the electoral system. An apparently minor change to the rules governing preferential voting was passed. By design, preference votes can only be given to a candidate who belongs to the party chosen by the voter. In the past, if a voter ticked a party and gave a preference vote to a candidate from another party, the cross for the party beat the candidate's party affiliation. The amendment reversed the rule. The preferred candidate's party affiliation now beats the party choice on ballot papers where they do not match.
         </p>
         
         <p>The SPÖ had won a majority of votes and seats in the previous election in 2005 (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1051), which was hard to replicate. The party's electoral strategy relied again on its popular <i>Land</i> governor Hans Niessl, who ran for a third term in office, and on the issues of security and illegal immigration along the border with Eastern Europe. In ambiguously worded campaign letters the SPÖ claimed that the <i>Land</i> governor could be ‘directly’ elected via a preference vote. In fact, the <i>Land</i> governor is elected by the Diet. A ballot paper with a preference vote for the current <i>Land</i> governor is counted as a vote for the SPÖ under the new rules. The ÖVP counter‐proposal to elect the <i>Land</i> governor by a separate, popular vote had been rejected by the SPÖ because it would have undermined its advantage of running the most popular candidate. Separate votes for the office of <i>Land</i> governor and the composition of the <i>Land</i> Diet could have resulted in a SPÖ<i>Land</i> governor facing a hostile majority in parliament.
         </p>
         
         <p>The SPÖ<i>Land</i> party demanded more police and an extension of a federal programme that provides military recruits as a support force to the police to battle illegal immigration and crime. National politics provided some tailwind. A plan by the Minister of Interior to establish a new centre for asylum seekers in a village in Burgenland met with strong regional opposition and was brought down by a local referendum in February (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2010</a></span>: 896). Nevertheless, on election day the SPÖ lost its majority, but the outcome secured the <i>Land</i> governorship for another term. Its share of votes dropped by about four percentage points to 48.3 per cent and the seats from 19 to 18. The ÖVP also suffered a small loss and was again the second largest party with 34.6 per cent of the votes and 13 seats. The Greens dropped from 5.2 to 4.2 per cent and lost one of their two seats. The FPÖ increased its share of votes from 5.8 to 9.0 and gained a seat. Its success, however, was tempered by the ‘List Burgenland’ (LBL) – an intra‐party split‐off by two former FPÖ members of the regional parliament – which collected exactly the number of votes required to pass the 4 per cent threshold and got one seat.
         </p>
         
         <p>The coalition government between SPÖ and ÖVP was quickly renewed after the election. A threat of a local re‐vote, which could kick the LBL out of the Diet, is still looming due to an instance of small‐scale vote fraud. An ÖVP mayor had used postal votes applications for 13 persons who had not gone to vote, filled out the ballot papers and sent them in on time for the deadline for postal votes two days after the election. Postal voting has been introduced in Austria in recent years at the national and the regional levels as a means to increase voter turnout. The episode exposed a potential for fraud as well as for post‐election tactical voting by voters and a new round of amendments tightening the electoral rules has started.</p>
         
         <p>The next election was in Styria on 26 September. Styria had been ruled by ÖVP governors from 1945 until 2005, when a voter swing to the left provided the post for the first time to the SPÖ (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1051−1052). Styria has been ruled by a Proporz government of SPÖ (five cabinet seats) and ÖVP (four cabinet seats). In parliament they controlled 25 and 24 seats, respectively, out of a total of 56. The Freedom Party's share of 4.6 per cent of the votes had failed to earn a seat in 2005. The Styrian two‐tier electoral system has no percentage threshold. A party needs to collect enough votes for a seat in one of four first‐tier districts to participate in seat distribution at the <i>Land</i>‐wide second tier. The Greens had only slightly more votes than the FPÖ (4.7 per cent), but they were more highly concentrated and translated into three seats. In addition, there were four Communist MPs in the Styrian Diet – the only Austrian regional parliament with Communist representation.
         </p>
         
         <p>The 2010 election was again a neck‐and‐neck race between Social Democrats and the People's Party for the position of largest party and the governor's post. The FPÖ was widely expected to re‐enter the Diet. The party's goals were more than 10 per cent of the votes and representation in <i>Land</i> government. The Communist Party wanted to hold on to its seats, the Greens aimed for an additional seat. Other parties were unlikely to gain representation. The campaign messages of ÖVP and Greens mostly catered to traditional party concerns. The Styrian Social Democrats wanted, like their sister party in Burgenland, to abolish Proporz government and have a smaller regional parliament. In addition, they pledged administrative reforms and strict budgetary discipline. The FPÖ campaign called for a construction ban for mosques and minarets. An anti‐Muslim Internet game on its website made national headlines and was taken down after a few days. Its slogan ‘Our money for our people’ tried to capture the nationalist sentiment in Austria developing in reaction to the currency and debt crisis and the European Union`s measures of support for ailing banks and Member States. The horse race between SPÖ and ÖVP lasted until election day. In the end, the SPÖ was again slightly ahead of the ÖVP, though both suffered losses to the FPÖ. The Social Democrats attained 38.3 per cent of the votes (−3.4, 23 seats), and the ÖVP 37.2 (−1.5, 22 seats). The FPÖ gained 10.7 per cent of the votes (+6.1), six seats in the diet and a seat in the <i>Land</i> government. The Communists dropped to 4.4 (−1.9) per cent of the votes and two seats, while the Greens grew slightly to 5.6 (+0.9) per cent and remained at three seats.
         </p>
         
         <p>Compared to its catastrophic result of 2005, the Freedom Party did well in 2010. Theoretically the single FPÖ member in the <i>Land</i> government was the tip of the scale between four SPÖ and four ÖVP government members, but the FPÖ's six votes in the Diet were not enough to elect an ÖVP candidate as <i>Land</i> governor. The two parties on the right – the People's Party and the Freedom Party – and the three parties on the left – Social Democrats, Greens and Communists – commanded together exactly half of the 56 seats. The SPÖ had a choice between a coalition with the People's Party or the Freedom Party. During the campaign the Social Democratic party leader refrained from publicly ruling out a coalition with the Freedom Party. Yet, a red–blue coalition would have met with strong intra‐party resistance. A coalition between SPÖ and ÖVP was finalised after ten days of negotiations and SPÖ party leader Franz Voves secured a second term as <i>Land</i> governor. The ambition of the ‘reform partnership’ formed by the Styrian party leaders of SPÖ and ÖVP has surprised observers. According to the coalition treaty, the Styrian government intends to abolish Proporz government, downsize the regional parliament from 56 to 48 seats, and merge small villages and administrative districts into larger entities to increase efficiency.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the last regional election of 2010 on 10 October in Vienna the big prize at stake was the Social Democrats' majority in the Diet, which also acts in a dual role as the city council. Both ÖVP and Greens were hopeful that an end of single party rule would lead to their inclusion in a two‐party coalition government. The SPÖ had ruled out a coalition with the FPÖ. The electoral system in Vienna provides the largest party with a bonus. About 45 per cent of the votes are enough for a majority in the Diet's 100 seats. Therefore, the other parties demanded a reform of the ‘unfair’ electoral system. In May, the leaders of ÖVP, Greens and FPÖ signed a notarised, common declaration that they would introduce a joint electoral reform bill after the election that abolishes the largest party bonus. The self‐binding declaration was meant to strengthen the parties' willpower after the election against expected SPÖ pressure in coalition negotiations to relent on the issue.</p>
         
         <p>In February, the SPÖ‐led <i>Land</i> government organised a consultative referendum on five topics (re‐introduction of janitors in public housing, city‐wide all‐day schools, introduction of an inner city toll, 24‐hour metro service and a compulsory licence for owners of dangerous dog breeds). The inner city toll was dismissed by the voters, the other four proposals were supported by a majority. The consultation cleared some of the other parties' potential campaign issues.
         </p>
         
         <p>The SPÖ was led into the campaign by long‐time <i>Land</i> governor and mayor Michael Häupl (since 1994). The party had done very well in 2005, winning 49.1 per cent of the votes and 55 seats. The second‐largest party was the ÖVP (18.8 per cent, 18 seats). Vienna was a difficult campaign ground for the ÖVP. Its voter appeal had been squeezed by the Social Democrats' control over a large political and economic career network, Green social liberalism and the Freedom Party's appeal to the <i>petit bourgeoisie</i>. The disunited party was led by Christine Marek, a former secretary of state, who had stepped down to head the party's campaign.
         </p>
         
         <p>The leader of the Greens, Maria Vassilakou, was hopeful of surpassing the ÖVP and lobbied for the first red–green coalition government in Austria. In 2005 the Greens had gained 14.6 per cent of the votes and 14 seats (and also two district council heads) – their best ever result in a regional election. Election prospects also looked very bright for the FPÖ, led into the campaign by national party leader Heinz‐Christian Strache. Due to the recent break‐away by the BZÖ, the Freedom Party had done badly in 2005 (14.8 per cent, 13 seats) (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1053). In 2010 the party aimed high and called the election a ‘duel on Vienna’ between Häupl and Strache. The party goal was more than 20 per cent of the votes, and, of course, the end of the SPÖ majority.
         </p>
         
         <p>The integration issue was on all parties' agenda, though direction and emphasis differed. The SPÖ stressed the need for respectful and orderly living together of Austrians and immigrants in the city's many council estates. The FPÖ campaign put the focus on unwillingness of immigrants to integrate. Its campaign again had an anti‐Muslim and anti‐Turkish bent exemplified by a super hero comic strip with references to the Ottoman siege of Vienna, against which the Greens filed a charge for incitement. The ÖVP wanted stricter requirements for immigrants to learn German, the Greens more programmes that further the integration of immigrants.</p>
         
         <p>Patronage and mismanagement by the SPÖ government were other prominent issues of the opposition parties. Additional ÖVP issues were better schools and more security through establishment of a town guard. The Greens called for cheaper housing rents and cheaper public transport and enlisted former national party leader Alexander Van der Bellen to garner preferential votes. The party's high hopes were dampened in the run‐up to the election when quarrels over candidate lists led to list split‐offs in district strongholds and when a Green member in the second chamber of parliament joined the Social Democrats to safeguard his political career (see above). Another six parties ran in 2010 – among them, BZÖ and the Communist Party.</p>
         
         <p>The SPÖ attained 44.3 per cent (−4.8) of the votes and 49 seats. Its legislative majority was gone. The People's Party dropped to 14 per cent (−4.8) and 13 seats – the party's worst result ever in Vienna. The Freedom Party increased strongly to 25.8 (+10.9) per cent of the votes and 27 seats, but missed the historic high mark of 27.9 per cent under party leader Jörg Haider in 1996. The Greens lost both votes and seats. Their share of votes dropped down to 12.6 (−2) per cent and the number of seats from 14 to 11. The combined vote share of other parties was only 3.3 per cent. Turnout rose strongly from 60.8 to 67.6 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>More than doubling its number of seats, the Freedom Party was one winner of the elections, but as the SPÖ remained steadfast in excluding them as coalition partner it had no influence on government formation. The Greens eventually emerged as a second winner. Television reports on election evening showed dejected Green activists, who mourned the loss of seats, but an upbeat party leader. Her optimism was confirmed two weeks later when the SPÖ decided to start coalition talks with the Greens. Initially a coalition with the ÖVP, which had already governed Vienna from 1996–2001, had appeared the more probable outcome. After three weeks of negotiations, the first red–green coalition government in Austria was announced. The Greens got only one seat in the <i>Land</i> government, but with control over the fields of transit, urban development, climate protection, energy management and civic participation. Häupl was elected <i>Land</i> governor and mayor, and Vassilakou became one of two vice‐governors and vice‐mayors.
         </p>
         
         <p>In June, national media tycoon Hans Dichand, editor and half owner of Austria's largest tabloid newspaper, <i>Neue Kronenzeitung</i>, died at the age of 89. Actively involved until his death, he had wielded an enormous, Rupert Murdoch‐style influence on Austrian politics and elections over the last few decades. Through his social conservative newspaper (often said to be the most successful newspaper in the world due to a market share of more than 40 per cent), he provided support to policies and politicians from across the left–right spectrum. And he withdrew it abruptly if they had gone too far for his liking or when public opinion turned. His tabloid provided a boost to the Green movement in the 1980s. For a long time it gave sympathetic coverage to the FPÖ's ascent under Jörg Haider and the party's anti‐immigrant and anti‐party state stance, but it opposed the formation of the ÖVP–FPÖ coalition government in 2000. The newspaper campaigned for Austria's accession to the European Union in the mid‐1990s and turned into a fiercely Eurosceptic newspaper afterwards. Its support propelled the tiny party of EU critic Hans‐Peter Martin two times, in 2004 and 2009, into the European Parliament. Ahead of the national election of 2008, the SPÖ leadership publicly acknowledged the tabloid's influence by sending an open letter to the editor. The letter amended the party's pro‐integrationist stand with a promise that subsequent EU treaty revisions would be put to a national referendum and not only passed by parliament. The letter secured the newspaper's support for the SPÖ election campaign. The last noteworthy meddling in politics (described above) occured during the presidential election campaign of this year, when Dichand forced the FPÖ's far right‐wing candidate Barbara Rosenkranz to publicly distance herself from any support of National Socialism, or face disapproval by his newspaper.

         <p>A press interview by the Turkish ambassador in November led to a spat with the government. He had criticised Austrian integration policy as illiberal and Austrians as disinterested about other cultures, except when on vacation. Austrian–Turkish relations are cool due to widespread opposition to Turkey's application for EU membership among the Austrian political elite and electorate (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1049). The Austrian government was piqued by the ambassador's suggestion to move integration policy from the Ministry of Interior to another ministry and especially by his remark that Vienna‐based international organisations should relocate to more liberal countries. Bilateral relations took another hit in June 2011. Turkey vetoed the election of the former Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ursula Plassnik, as the next general secretary of the Organisation for Secuirty and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is based in Vienna. Plassnik had been critical of Turkey becoming a member of the European Union.
