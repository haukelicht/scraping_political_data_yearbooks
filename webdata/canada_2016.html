         <p>This was the first full year of a Liberal majority government since 2003. Canadians seemed transfixed by the celebrity of Prime Minister Trudeau, a status enhanced by a widely reported visit to the American capital and discussions of the ‘bromance’ between the prime minister and United States President Barack Obama. The major opposition parties were all seeking new leaders by the end of year, ensuring that those parties were focused as much on their own internal matters as they were on holding the Liberals to account. The government introduced a stimulus budget with a huge deficit, made major changes in the process of Senate appointments and passed legislation on assisted suicide. As well, the government celebrated an agreement on Free Trade with the EU, but, as the year ended, the American presidential election and concerns over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) cast a huge shadow over Canada.</p>

            <p>Elections were held in two of the ten provinces and ‘conservative’ parties emerged triumphant in both. Each of these provincial elections took place in the prairie region and had been postponed from 2015 because of potential overlap with the federal election. The Progressive Conservative party of Manitoba swept a 17‐year New Democratic Party (NDP) government from office. Messy efforts on the part of the governing NDP to replace their leader came to naught and the sitting premier won an unprecedented re‐election to his position by a very narrow margin but this proved a temporary reprise as his party suffered a massive defeat in the ensuing election. In neighbouring Saskatchewan, the right‐wing Saskatchewan party, in power since 2007, continued to dominate, securing an easy re‐election with a leader who routinely led all other provincial premiers in approval ratings. Despite forming a majority government federally, the Liberals secured less than 4 per cent of the vote in the Saskatchewan election and elected no members. Although the Liberals raised their support in Manitoba to 14 per cent, they elected only three members and failed to achieve official party status in the legislature.</p>
            
            <p>An election in the Yukon, one of the three northern territories, rounded out the major subnational elections and provided the lone victory for the Liberal party. The party moved from third party status in the legislature and ended the 14‐year reign of the conservative Yukon party, promising to improve relations with indigenous communities. The New Democrats fell to just two seats in the Assembly.</p>

         <p>The Liberal government continued to be lauded for the gender balance provided in the initial cabinet construction in 2015. Only minor changes took place in cabinet in 2016. Hunter Tootoo, the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, resigned in May citing the need to seek treatment for addiction. The government House Leader Dominic Leblanc initially took on the additional responsibility of that portfolio. In August, Prime Minister Trudeau removed the onerous House Leader role from Leblanc and added it to the responsibilities of Bardish Chagger, the Minister of Tourism and Small Business. She became the first woman to hold this role. No further changes took place but there was much speculation that major changes would be coming in 2017.</p>

         <p>There was little change in the composition of the Canadian House of Commons in 2016. Two MPs, one Conservative and one Liberal died during 2016 with an October by‐election held to replace the Conservative member who passed away in March. The Conservatives easily held on to the riding. As the year ended there were two additional vacancies in the House of Commons, caused by the resignation of two Conservative members (former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper left active politics and another former Conservative cabinet minister entered the race for party leader in the province of Alberta). The only other change in the legislature affected the Liberal numbers: when Hunter Tootoo resigned from cabinet he simultaneously left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent.</p>

         <p>Standings in the unelected Senate changed dramatically in 2016. Since former Prime Minister Harper was unwilling to appoint new members in the absence of Senate reform, the number of vacancies in the 105 seat chamber had climbed to 22 by the beginning of the year. Prime Minister Trudeau, following the advice of a new non‐partisan advisory council, added a number of members to the Senate. These Senators did not sit as party representatives but took on a non‐affiliated role and by the end of the year the non‐affiliated group was the largest in the Senate.</p>

         <p>The Bloc Québécois and Conservatives were led by interim leaders throughout 2016 with both scheduled to choose new permanent leaders in 2017. The major change occurred in the NDP. Tom Mulcair who led the party in the 2015 election became the first party leader to be formally ousted by a leadership review in more than 50 years. While commentators were speculating that he would need a level of support above 70 per cent in order to remain as leader, delegates to the party convention in April ended the speculation as more than half of them (52 per cent) voted to launch a new leadership election (Toronto Star <span title=""><a href="#epdy12153-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12153-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>). Despite the loss of the leadership review, Mulcair continued to serve formally as the party leader and the NDP will join the Bloc and Conservatives in electing a new leader in 2017.

         <p>The Liberal government brought in major changes to the process of making appointments to the unelected Senate. The government created an advisory board, consisting of three permanent members, and which would be supplemented by two ad hoc members appointed from each jurisdiction in which there was a vacancy. The federal members participate in all recommendations while the ad hoc members participate only in matters relating to the jurisdiction for which they were appointed. This board is non‐partisan in nature and has the responsibility for dealing with individual Canadians who applied to become Senators as well as those nominated by different groups and organizations. The board was mandated ‘to provide non‐binding merit based recommendations to the Prime Minister’. (Report of the Independent Advisory Board, 13 December 2016). Five names were submitted for each vacancy and Prime Minister Trudeau subsequently added 28 new non‐aligned members to the Senate, all drawn from the short lists provided by the Independent Advisory Board.</p>

         <p>The unelected Senate continued to make news in 2016. Although the controversial trial of a former Conservative Senator on fraud and breach of trust ended in acquittal and effectively took those issues off the political agenda, the new method of appointment became an issue. Concerns were raised about potential changes in the relationship between the elected House of Commons and the unelected Senate. Suggestions were made that new Senators might not feel the deference to the elected chamber that their predecessors possessed. In essence, the reform could conceivably add legitimacy to the unelected upper house and increase the possibility of disagreements between the two chambers. Indeed, this increased potential for conflict was manifested in the Senate's return of legislation on assisted suicide to the Commons as well as Senate‐inspired changes to the Commons‐approved budget implementation bill as it related to consumer protection. As one of the new non‐affiliated Senators commented, ‘I consider myself an independent, and the government will not tell me how to vote’ (Ivison <span title=""><a href="#epdy12153-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12153-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In moving ahead with a new agenda, the Liberal government launched consultations on changing the single‐member plurality electoral system that had been used in every previous federal election. This was in keeping with a campaign promise that the 2015 election would be the last to be fought under this electoral system. Discussions on this issue proved problematic both in substance and in terms of the composition of a parliamentary committee that would make recommendations on the issue. The government eventually agreed to an all‐party committee on which the opposition parties would have a majority, and in December that committee recommended a national referendum on proportional representation. Despite this recommendation, a referendum, let alone actual reform seemed increasingly unlikely. Indeed, in October, the Prime Minister suggested that the desire for change had been associated more with dislike for the former government and the need for a new system was now ‘less compelling’ (Kohut <span title=""><a href="#epdy12153-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12153-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The first Liberal budget marked a major departure from the Conservative emphasis on deficit control and elimination. The new government moved forward with a number of commitments made in the 2015 election campaign, and increased spending with the aim of spurring job creation and creating a fairer tax system. As a result, the Liberal budget projected a deficit of almost $30 billion for the next two years and did not anticipate a return to surplus before 2019.</p>
         
         <p>Trade policy continued to attract government attention. Seven years after the Conservative government announced an agreement in principle with the EU on Free Trade, the Liberals signed an actual agreement with the EU. The agreement looked about to collapse at the last minute as a regional government in Belgium initially proved unwilling to endorse the deal, and the Liberal Trade Minister left the negotiations suggesting that Europe was not capable of signing an agreement. The agreement eventually received the endorsements necessary and the 1600 page agreement moved forward to the European parliament for approval as well as for formal ratification from member countries. The agreement is intended to increase Canadian trade with Europe possibly by as much as 20 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>Increased trade with Europe would diminish Canada's trade dependence on the United States, a goal pursued by many governments over the years. With about three‐quarters of Canada's exports destined for the United States, the November election of a new American President who has indicated a desire to renegotiate the NAFTA, raises concerns that the government will need to address and ensured that trade agreements will continue to engender debate.</p>
         
         <p>The Canadian parliament wrestled with a deadline established by the Supreme Court for legislation providing citizens with a right to medical assistance with end of life decisions. The Court's decision required parliament to pass new legislation relating to medical assistance in dying, more commonly referred to as assisted suicide and set a final deadline of 6 June 2016 for this to be set up. In a rare vote in which party lines were not rigidly adhered to, a handful of Liberal MPs opposed the government bill, while more than a dozen opposition members supported it. The bill applied only to patients with terminal or incurable diseases and was criticised for not dealing with those in non‐terminal situations. The Senate amended the legislation accordingly, but when the House of Commons again passed the legislation, the Senate accepted the position of the Commons. Public attention on this issue was enhanced by the so‐called ‘Elbowgate’ incident on the floor of the House of Commons. The prime minister helped to assist the Conservative whip to his seat in order to facilitate voting on the Bill and in the process an NDP MP was elbowed. The prime minister apologised both to the House and the individual member for the incident and although it initially appeared that the House Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs would look into the matter, his apologies and the acceptance of those apologies put an end to the matter.</p>
         
         <p>Energy issues continued to be important in Canada. As part of its climate change commitments, the government threatened to impose carbon taxes on provinces that did not introduce their own such taxes. On a somewhat different front, as the prices of oil remained relatively low, the government moved on the issue of pipeline construction and approved two controversial pipelines including one to the Pacific coast. Although other projects were turned down or delayed, the approval of lines generated controversy.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, controversy marked Liberal fundraising efforts with concerns raised about events where participants had opportunities to discuss issues with the prime minister and other cabinet ministers. The ethics commissioner called for stricter regulation on fundraising and indicated that she would be raising questions with participants about these events.</p>
