         <p>Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg had not planned to make any changes to the cabinet in 2006, but in September he needed to find a new Minister of Trade and Industry as Mr Odd Eriksen wanted to resign. Eriksen, who has two small children, said he wanted to pay more attention to his family in northern Norway. The media and political opponents, however, pointed to the fact that Eriksen had been the target of serious criticism. Several business leaders, and even some fellow Labour members, claimed that he had been too passive, and he scored relatively low on public opinion polls that ranked the effectiveness of government leaders. Eriksen was replaced by Mr Dag Terje Andersen, a long‐time Labour Party politician who was a short‐term Agriculture Minister in the Labour Government led by Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland in 1996–1997. Andersen is also one of the few MPs with work experience in private industry and forestry.</p>

         <p>A new party law came into force on January 1. The law includes the previous party registration framework as well as new regulations on party funding. Only registered parties can be given public subsidies, and these subsidies are divided between a baseline contribution (1/10) and a vote‐based contribution (9/10). The vote‐based contribution is given as a fixed rate per vote to all parties that achieved votes at the last election. The baseline contribution is awarded to all parties who got at least 2.5 per cent of the votes at the last national election or at least one seat in the national parliament. As for the local and regional party branches, only parties that received at least 4 per cent of the votes or at least one seat in the local or regional council can receive this contribution. The new law also regulates private contributions. Political parties cannot receive anonymous contributions, and contributions that exceed 30,000 kroner on a national level (or 20,000 on the regional or 10,000 on the local level) must be registered with the name of the contributor (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg &amp; Brekken 2006</a></span>: 1228). The new law also introduces a new independent committee that will be responsible for the allocation of public contributions. This committee will also handle complaints related to the law and submit an annual report to the Ministry of Government Administration and Reform about its work. Parties must prepare annual income reports, including public and private contributors. They must also report on any agreements that are made between contributors and the party. This information will be made available through a public register.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is also worth mentioning that the Bondevik II Government's efforts to allow political advertising on television were stopped by Stoltenberg II. In September 2004, important changes in the constitution were made that opened the way to political and religious advertising on television (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2005</a></span>: 1142–1143). Bondevik II, however, had not finalised the new bill proposal when Stoltenberg II took over in September 2005. After the Storting election in 2005, there was no longer a parliamentary majority in favour of political advertising on television, and the Minister of Culture and Church Affairs announced in May 2006 that Stoltenberg II would refrain from implementing the work their predecessors had not been able to finish.

         <p>The Islamic cartoon crisis that began in Denmark in 2005 spread to Norway at the beginning of 2006. On 10 January, <i>Magazinet</i>, a non‐daily Christian newspaper, reprinted the controversial caricatures of the Prophet Muhamed that were first published by the Danish newspaper <i>Jyllands‐Posten</i> in September 2005. This stirred a massive debate about religion and freedom of speech. The publications set off a wave of violent international demonstrations against Denmark and Norway across the Muslim world in January and February. The Norwegian Government handled the crisis somewhat differently to the Danish Government (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Bille 2006</a></span>). Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre urged Norway's embassies to apologise for the publication of the caricature, which spurred counter‐criticism that Muslim countries should respect freedom of expression. Parts of the Christian community, as well as the press organisations, supported the decision made by <i>Magazinet</i> to reprint the caricatures. The Progress Party and the Conservatives accused the Government and the Foreign Minister of failing to defend freedom of speech. They claimed the Government was acting in a cowardly fashion when they put all the blame on the newspaper. At the same time, the Social Inclusion Minister, Labour's Bjarne Håkon Hanssen, and the leader of the Chrisian Peoples Party, Dagfinn Høybråten, tried to create a dialog between <i>Magazinet</i>'s editor and the leader of the Islamic Council of Norway. After intense negotiations, the opponents came to an understanding and the editor apologised for the publication of the caricatures. The Muslim community in Norway was very pleased by the turn of events, and applauded the decision to apologise. There were, however, still critics who claimed that the red–green Government had forced the editor into an apology. The leader of the Norwegian press association, however, was not among these critics. He argued that since the issue now had turned into a question of Norway's relationship with several of the countries in the Middle East, the editor had shown great social responsibility by offering an apology.
         </p>
         
         <p>Norway's relationship with other countries also became important for other reasons in 2006. As in 2005, the main reason for this was the three Government parties' divergent foreign policy views. It was described as a victory for the Socialist Left Party (SV) when the Norwegian Government refused to send additional troops to help fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. During the election campaign in 2005, Labour said that they would not let their potential coalition partner rebuff NATO, but in autumn 2006, the Prime Minster, the Defence Minister and the Foreign Minister (all from Labour) had to fend off massive criticism and messages of disappointment from the opposition parties in Parliament and from the United Kingdom, the United States and NATO itself. At the peak of their anger, the opposition party leaders said they would consider putting forward a motion of their own to send troops. They would not have won support, but it would have sent a strong signal of displeasure to the sitting Government. However, according to the media, the opposition did not manage to agree on the wording of such a proposal, so it was dropped. The opposition parties were also furious over the fact that Parliament's extended Foreign Affairs Committee had not been informed in advance, and that the opposition first learned about the decision from an improvised press conference in the hall of the parliament building. The Foreign Minister apologised for this, but the Government stressed that Norway continues to support the NATO operation in Afghanistan ‘both politically, in principle and in practice’, but that Norwegian forces should be concentrated in the relatively peaceful north. The Minister of Defence argued that Norway, as a relatively small country, ‘can't say “yes” all the time’ to international requests for aid.</p>
         
         <p>There was also a lot of attention directed towards Afghanistan during the summer, when a group of Afghan refugees started a hunger strike. They protested against a final rejection of their appeals for asylum, and declared that they would refuse food until Norwegian immigration authorities changed their minds and let them stay in the country. Again, this became an important issue because the Government parties disagreed on how to handle the strike. Several leading SV politicians criticised the Government's handling of the Afghan hunger strike. They demanded ‘more humane’ treatment of the Afghan refugees, who said they would rather starve to death in Norway than be forced to return to Afghanistan. The United Nations recommended guidelines that would allow the Afghans to remain in Norway, but the Norwegian Government opted to follow its own policies. Prime Minister Stoltenberg from Labour argued that a hunger strike could not be a reason for granting residence in Norway. The Prime Minister stressed that his rejection of the demand from the Socialist Left Party did not indicate a new split within his Government coalition. The strike was resolved after 26 days when Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen (SV) and Minister of Labour and Social Inclusion Bjarne Håkon Hanssen (DNA) declared that no Afghans from outside of the capital Kabul should be sent home before the end of the year at the earliest. The Government also promised to abide by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recommendation for returns to Afghanistan, and that no one would be sent back before the UNHCR considered it safe.</p>
         
         <p>It is also worth mentioning that Norway's asylum policies had been a hot topic earlier in the year when information came out that the Directorate of Immigration (UDI) had violated both the law and political directives when it granted residency permits to nearly 200 Iraqi Kurds in autumn 2005. A commission that probed the controversial permits blasted the former head of UDI, and his successor also resigned. Leader of the Conservatives and the responsible minister in the Bondevik II Government, Erna Solberg, argued that UDI's bosses at the time were disloyal in their actions, and was furious when she found out that UDI had defied ministry instructions that Solberg claimed were clear. By the time the permits were granted in October (a month after the 2005 election), the coalition, of which Solberg had been a member, had lost the election and was on its way out. The report stressed how the UDI leadership acted in the belief that the incoming centre‐left Government coalition would have a more liberal view on immigration issues, and go along with granting residency to the Iraqi Kurds, even though not all their identities could be confirmed and some had criminal records.</p>
         
         <p>Another central issue in 2006 was the environment. In March, the Government unveiled a new ‘management plan’ for its northern offshore regions that aims to open up new areas of open sea in the Arctic to oil exploration while protecting sensitive environmental sites, especially along the coast. This was an important compromise between the three parties in the Government, and especially SV was happy with the result (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg &amp; Brekken 2006</a></span>: 1228). However, another environmental issue may well be more problematic for Stoltenberg II. In their initial coalition agreement (the ‘Soria Moria declaration’), the three parties had stated that any new Government concession for gas‐fired plants be made conditional on the removal of carbon dioxide emissions. The Socialist Left Party was always the most insistent about the capture of carbon dioxide emissions, and had promised that they would not go along with construction of power plants unless carbon dioxide emissions were captured from the first day of operation. Consequently, both the Government and especially SV was roundly bashed by environmentalists when they bowed to demands from state oil company Statoil and agreed to allow construction of a new gas‐fired power plant with no capture of carbon dioxide emissions for its first five years of operation. Former Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik from the Christian People's Party (KrF) said he thought the Socialist Left Party should withdraw from the Government coalition. Bondevik was equally disappointed with the Centre Party, which also presented itself as an environmental champion opposed to increased carbon dioxide emissions. His own coalition Government, Bondevik I, of which the Centre Party had been a part, had even resigned after a conflict over the same issue in 2000. The Minister of the Environment, Helen Bjørnøy (SV), reported to the media that she had considered resigning and that the Government coalition came close to falling apart on the issue, but held together when both SV and SP gave in to Labour and the Statoil demands. Most political commentators also argued that SV's defeat on this issue is what caused Labour to give in on the decision to rebuff NATO.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Norwegian economy performed well in 2006. Stoltenberg II presented its first state budget, which contained a large surplus thanks to Norway's oil revenues. However, the budget also contained a series of tax hikes. The Government argued that the budget would strengthen many of the social welfare provisions the three parties had promised during the election campaign. The budget indicated that income tax rates would rise for Norwegians earning more than 650,000 kroner (about US$100,000) a year, while those with lower incomes would receive higher personal deductions. Rates would also rise on the controversial tax Norway has long placed on individual net worth. Several health and welfare programmes were prioritised, including additional funding to local hospitals, more money for psychiatric health and therapy programmes, financial aid to the elderly and support to finance the Government's commitment to child day care. Both the opposition parties, as well as the employers' group NHO, claimed that the new tax hikes leave Norway going in the opposite direction of the rest of Europe. The majority coalition Government had no trouble passing the budget in Parliament. It was therefore interesting to note how they still made a small adjustment to improve the situation for voluntary organisations in order to please the Christian People's Party.</p>
         
         <p>An issue that dominated a large part of the autumn was the Government's decision to change the terms of the existing national sick pay scheme. Stoltenberg II was dissatisfied with the sick leave rate and wanted to require employers to foot more of the bills instead of the state. Gerd‐Liv Valla, head of union confederation LO and traditionally a powerful Labour Party ally, was particularly enraged over the new Government policy. She argued that this was a betrayal of the so‐called ‘IA agreement’– a plan for inclusive employment that the state and all types of business organisations have agreed upon. The employers were also upset and, together, the eight largest organisations in Norway's labour sector formed an unprecedented coalition of unions and employers that set out to stop the Government's plans to change the national sick pay scheme. The Government was also criticised by its own party members for being arrogant and simply assuming that Parliament would approve its sick pay changes.</p>
         
         <p>Labour Party members in particular disagreed with their own Government. Stoltenberg II therefore sent out a letter to all of its opponents, offering to negotiate an alternative means of reducing sick leave and the costs it carries. Prime Minister Stoltenberg, who led these talks himself, had one absolute demand: they had to find a way to reduce state expenditures related to sick pay by 2.5 billion kroner in order to maintain the budget balance for 2007. If not, the Government would stick to its original plan and let employers foot the bill. The solution to the sick pay battle appeared in November when the Government realised that new estimates indicated that sick leave would decline and that tax revenues would be higher than expected. After the rather embarrassing fallout from the sick pay scheme debate, Labour experienced a sharp drop on opinion polls. The opposition parties, on the other hand, used the opportunity to stress how the organisation of trade unions (LO) had too much power over the Government.</p>
         
         <p>An issue that appeared towards the end of the year was the debate on whether to separate church and state. The Government parties disagreed on this issue. The Socialist Left wanted a separation of church and state, while the Centre Party was the only party in Parliament who wanted the existing arrangement to continue. Labour, like many of the other parliamentary parties, had not decided what its policy should be. Hence, the Government was unable to agree on the future organisation of the Norwegian state church in their platform. Thus they decided to leave this stance until the Church Council had reached its own conclusion. A round of hearings was also arranged with a deadline for written submission set for 1 December. The result was that a majority of the Church Council wanted to separate church and state. However, they still wanted the church to maintain a privileged position among religious communities in Norway. The Centre Party proposed that the question should be put to a referendum, but the other parties in Government were not convinced that this was a good idea.</p>
         
         <p>In May, Ms Siv Jensen took over as a new leader of the right‐wing Progress Party. The party's former leader, Carl I. Hagen, had been a very popular, if controversial, leader for 28 years. Although it came as no surprise that Ms Jensen took over as the new leader, it was interesting to see a woman in her thirties take over the reins in a party long seen as dominated by men. However, she lost her battle to change her job title from ‘fore<i>man</i>’ to the more gender‐neutral ‘leader’ used by all the other parties. While the party continues to be branded as populist by most opponent parties and commentators, Jensen seemed intent on ushering in a new sense of professionalism and more willingness to cooperate with other parties. The Conservatives were also clearly inspired by the new centre‐right coalition that took over in Sweden in October. There the Conservative's leader, Fredrik Reinfeldt, led all four non‐socialist parties into the election as a joint alliance, and it was clear in 2006 that the Norwegian Conservative Party leader Erna Solberg looked more willing than previously to cooperate with the Progress Party.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, it is also worth mentioning that a lot of attention was directed towards the new ‘foreman’ of the Progress Party and her use of the party's parliamentary group funds earmarked for ‘work relevant to Parliament’. Ms Jensen used these funds to foot the bill for her personal trainer at a private health studio, despite the fact that Parliament has its own training studio where members can train for free. It was also noted that Jensen had been granted a new car via the same funds. This in turn directed the media spotlight onto the Government's use of company cars for cabinet ministers' private use, forcing it in the end to drop the arrangement.</p>
