         <p>On June 11, Labour Prime Minister Helen Clark called an election four months earlier than required. At the time, Labour had a commanding lead in the opinion polls over all the other parties, often topping 50 per cent. Economic times were good, but projected to deteriorate. Neither of these factors would have been sufficient reason for an early election in a country with a tight election cycle of a maximum of just over three years and a record of few early elections in the past.</p>
         
         <p>Other developments were catalysts. Belying its name, Labour's coalition partner, the Alliance, had split in acrimony. Cabinet ministers representing both party fragments continued in the Government and there was no constitutional reason why it should not serve out its full term. However, due to the Electoral Integrity Act, a law against ‘party‐hopping’ (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>), and despite being expelled from the party on grounds of their effective withdrawal, leader Jim Anderton and a majority of the party's Members of Parliament (MPs) continued to sit as Alliance MPs, with Anderton remaining parliamentary leader. To many, this made a mockery of the party‐hopping law Anderton himself had championed. National Party leader Bill English taunted the Government, asserting that the coalition had broken down, and calling for an early election. He was granted his wish. On announcing the election date, Clark pointed to the criticism of the embarrassing state of the Alliance, claiming that continued questioning of the situation was disruptive of the business of Parliament. It was therefore necessary to seek a mandate on a new footing.
         </p>
         
         <p>The real reason for the early election received less public attention. Labour and the Alliance had formed a minority coalition in 1999 on the basis of confidence and supply guaranteed by the Green Party. Cooperation between the Greens and the Government parties had been relatively effective, but it was beginning to come loose at the seams. The Green Party was unwilling to allow sufficient parliamentary time under urgency for the Government to carry through its legislative programme with sufficient speed to prevent a growing backlog. Even more significant, the Greens declared that they would vote against the Labour‐led Government if it were to allow a moratorium preventing the commercial release of genetically modified (GM) organisms into the environment to be raised in October 2003, as already enacted in law. Labour wished to see the moratorium lifted, and the hot issue of release or non‐release of such organisms consigned to a rigorous regulatory regime and out of electoral politics. Poll support for Labour was strong, at levels that could make possible a single‐party majority government, or at least one together with Anderton's new party, the Progressive Coalition. Given all this, and the tantalising prospect of perhaps being able to bypass the Greens in the next Parliament, Clark took the plunge.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The decision was risky for various reasons. A dispute between the Government as employer and secondary school teachers was approaching crisis point. The union had made an agreement with the Government subject to member ratification. During the campaign, there was an explosion of wildcat school strikes, and the agreement was rejected by a large margin. In addition, while in opposition some years earlier, Clark had been asked to paint a picture for sale for the benefit of a charity. Having artistic taste but little talent of that kind, she had instead commissioned a work and donated it in her name. When this information became public, Clark was accused of fraud. While most New Zealanders considered the ‘paintergate’ scandal trivial, a formal complaint by a member of the public sparked a police investigation, still ongoing when Clark announced the date of the election.</p>
         
         <p>The GM issue was also dangerous. Various opinion polls indicated wide public unease about the safety of GM foods, and about the wisdom of the release of GM organisms. The country's ‘clean and green’ image could be under threat and, in particular, growing international markets for organic food and other products could be at risk. Yet the Greens’ threat to pull down a centre‐left government and force a subsequent election on a single issue raised the spectre of their holding the country to ransom for little likely purpose. Such a scenario would be most likely to open up the possibility of centre‐right rule, without necessarily preventing the moratorium from being lifted.</p>
         
         <p>Clark's initial request to voters was for a single‐party majority Government, or for something very close to it in coalition with Jim Anderton's post‐Alliance ‘Progressive Coalition’, a party unlikely to rock the Labour boat in any but the nicest possible ways. The campaign started well for Labour, but National leader Bill English's public statements on the police report on the painting issue that was released a few days into the campaign, and Clark's indignant reaction, began a Labour slide in support. The report had established grounds for a fraud prosecution, but recommended no action on grounds of the triviality of the matter. The Labour slide continued after an interview of Clark by a prominent journalist, John Campbell. Without warning, Campbell accused Clark and her Government of covering up release and planting of GM corn in New Zealand over the early summer of 2000–2001. Clark denied the accusation, but would not answer specific questions in the absence of further briefing on the specifics from the relevant Ministers and officials. Campbell persisted, and the Prime Minister became very frosty, describing Campbell in the aftermath as a ‘sanctimonious little creep’.</p>
         
         <p>The morning after, a book was published making the allegations. Campbell had been given an advance copy. By the end of the day, the Government's account of the matter began to provide the details for rebuttal, but the 24‐hour old Campbell‐Clark ‘ambush’ interview was still played on television. In the following days it seemed that there was wide scientific agreement that the episode had been a false alarm, although there were dissenters. At the time of the alleged release, some information about the matter had been provided both to the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification and to the Green Party. However, after the Campbell interview, the Greens made statements apparently giving credence to the allegations. Labour‐Green relations, already difficult, became more so. The Greens’ polling initially improved, but as the Government rebuttal began to draw blood, their tide began to fall back as questions were raised about their handling of the matter. With the Labour and Greens downfalls, other parties would rise, most notably New Zealand First.</p>
         
         <p>On election day, Labour's vote dropped from its pre‐campaign poll heights much more substantially than expected, although it remained able to form a minority government. Labour's vote rose compared to 1999, but less than expected given the availability of much of the former Alliance support. Meanwhile, due to a very weak campaign, National fell to the lowest level ever polled by a major centre‐right party in New Zealand's electoral history. The centre‐right populist party New Zealand First made a strong recovery, and United Future appeared as a significant pivotal player. The Greens increased their support, but not nearly as much as expected given the salience of the GM issue and public disquiet about it. The centre‐left virtually held its 1999 vote share (down only slightly from 51.6 to 51 per cent), but lost seats nonetheless. Act maintained its vote, with a strong campaign most successful on the law and order issue, but centre‐right support shifted to the centre. United Future, a party explicitly designed to play a pivotal role, took up that position for the first time.</p>
         
         <p>Despite their greater distance from majority government than expected, Labour and the Progressive Coalition were in a strong enough position to play off United Future and the Greens against each other in post‐election talks. United Future quickly agreed to provide support on confidence and supply. Meanwhile, the Greens could probably be relied on to support the Government's more left‐leaning legislation when United Future might refuse to do so. A Scandinavian‐style party system appeared to have emerged, with Labour in a strategically dominant position, at least for the time being. Meanwhile, turnout declined to a New Zealand low, although less on an age‐eligible base than in the official figures, due to a change in the compilation of the electoral rolls that had significantly increased the registration rate.</p>

         <p>Changes to the Cabinet after the 2002 election were small. Most were due to the political demise of the Alliance Party and its replacement as junior coalition partner by the much less successful Progressive Coalition. The Alliance had held four cabinet seats. The Progressive Coalition was allocated only one. Reflecting the reduced political influence of his party, Jim Anderton lost the Deputy Prime Minister position to Labour deputy leader Michael Cullen. Due to the confidence held in him by the Prime Minister, Anderton retained a high position, ranking third in the cabinet. New Zealand Labour Party MPs elect their cabinet ministers. Other than the three retiring Alliance members, no ministers from the previous cabinet failed to secure a position in the new one. New Zealand Labour Prime Ministers do, however, retain the normal powers of assigning rankings and responsibilities. Other than for Anderton and Cullen, no rankings were shifted.</p>
         
         <p>Political commentary on the cabinet changes focused on three issues: the large number of executive appointments, the number of Maori appointed and the jockeying among Labour MPs to secure cabinet vacancies. Dyson had been a Minister outside Cabinet in the previous Government and Carter, a Junior Labour Whip. John Tamihere had chaired the Maori Select Committee and was widely regarded as one of the more capable Maori MPs. All had been well placed to gain cabinet positions. Unsuccessful aspirants were placated by an expansion of the number of Ministers outside Cabinet from three to six, and by the appointment of two parliamentary under‐secretaries. This raised the number of executive appointments to 28 members, more than half of the Labour parliamentary caucus, not counting three further parliamentary private secretaries: a new tier of executive appointment receiving no extra pay but acting as ‘trainees’ assisting particular ministers. Given widespread demands for a reduction in the size of cabinet, the expansion of the executive was unexpected. Analysts interpreted this development as a means of containing pressures and potential conflicts in a second‐term government. Meanwhile, as in the previous term, two Maori sat in cabinet. Three Maori were among the eight non‐cabinet executive positions. The number of women in cabinet declined by one to six, a matter the Prime Minister indicated she would redress in the future.</p>

         <p>Labour's election success was underpinned by one of the New Zealand economy's strongest growth performances for many years: 4.4 per cent over the calendar year, one of the very highest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Some of the growth could be explained by immigration, but even on a GDP (gross domestic product) per capita basis the rate was 2.9 per cent. With export earnings high, agriculture prospering and the housing market booming, any incumbent government would have benefited from the consequent ‘feel‐good’ factor. Indeed, Labour did ride high in the polls throughout most of the year, averaging just over 50 per cent before the election was called and, two months after the election, recovering to an average of only just under 50 per cent for the rest of the year. Preferences for Labour leader Helen Clark as Prime Minister were historically at a very high point of about 50 per cent before the election: they suffered during the election, but recovered somewhat afterward to settle in the high 40s. This makes her the most popular New Zealand Prime Minister since continuous time series of polling on this question began in 1979.</p>
         
         <p>The prosperous economy coupled with confidence in Clark's leadership made Labour a hard target for its opponents. The teacher's strike sapped confidence in Labour's ability to handle education, normally one of the top two issues on voters’ minds. Also, post‐election, the Government's tight management and competent handling of affairs was less apparent. It appeared to be suffering from a dangerous combination of over‐confidence and increased distrust of the media in the wake of the Campbell campaign interview with the Prime Minister.</p>
         
         <p>Another major issue first surfaced prior to the election, but gathered momentum only afterwards. Since about 1998, building industry sources had been reporting increasing leakage of water into buildings constructed since the mid‐1990s, but it was only in April 2002 that the Minister, George Hawkins, was officially briefed by the Building Industry Authority. More seriously, the leaks were also associated with structural damage. Changes in building technology, deregulation of the industry, increased competition on price, lowered standards and a shortage of workforce skills appeared to be the main reasons for the problem. Both the Building Industry Authority and Hawkins were slow to appreciate the seriousness of the issue. On their advice, the Prime Minister initially downplayed the problem, advising those affected to take legal advice and accusing the country's leading newspaper, the <i>New Zealand Herald</i>, of exaggerating its extent. The Government later blamed the absence of policy instruments for its slowness to respond to the issue, but the damage was done.
         </p>
         
         <p>Immigration returned to a higher profile in political debate in 2002. Its reappearance was coupled with a recovery in support for the New Zealand First Party, and its leader, Winston Peters. New Zealand First promised dramatically to cut the inflow of migrants into New Zealand. Their particular concern was immigration from Asian countries, and consequent social change in some urban areas. Labour's immediate post‐election rhetoric was dismissive of New Zealand First. Labour defended multiculturalism and the economic benefits derived from immigration. However, by the end of the year, the Government had raised the standard of competence in English required of immigrants. It argued in defence of the change that its intent was not to reduce the number of immigrants from Asia, but to enhance their quality and value to the country. The change in policy was widely interpreted as a capitulation to some of New Zealand First's demands. The Government retorted that the changes were part of an incremental review process and had nothing to do with New Zealand First.</p>
         
         <p>Another matter first raised in the election campaign came to a head later in the year. The government buyout of the nation's air carrier, Air New Zealand, had averted disaster but not solved the company's long‐term problems, particularly given the state of the international airline market. A further capital injection was needed, but the Government did not intend to provide it. During the election campaign National's Bill English accused the Government of brokering a deal in which Australian airline Qantas would take a share in Air New Zealand. At that stage, the matter was indeed under discussion between the two companies. An official proposal emerged in November and received Government support, but still required endorsement by regulatory bodies in both countries before going ahead.</p>
         
         <p>Maintenance and development of the country's transport infrastructure also formed a major part of the national discourse in 2002. Population growth in Auckland, the country's largest city, had outstripped the capacities of the city's roads and public transport facilities. A transfer of infrastructural investment to Auckland caused resentment elsewhere in the country, but the economic costs of Auckland's transport problems needed to be faced. New Zealand's railways had been privatised in the early 1990s. Ten years on, their profits were in decline, with consequences of reduced services and deferred maintenance. With a healthy surplus, the Government was under some pressure to acquire the tracks, if not the entire company, and develop a more integrated transport strategy.</p>
         
         <p>The treatment of Maori in New Zealand law and politics continued to be a matter of debate. While the Government had pulled back from an explicitly Maori‐centred policy of distributional politics after its first year of office, it retained a commitment to settlement of Treaty claims, including the defence of Maori culture. For this reason, it had made a substantial commitment to the establishment of Maori television. However, the first chief executive of the Maori Television Service, Canadian John Davy, was sacked in April for fraud over his claimed qualifications for the position and later jailed for six months. Questions were asked about the process of his appointment, and the judgement of those involved.</p>
         
         <p>Another sacking attracted much attention in October: that of state‐owned enterprise Television New Zealand (TVNZ) chairman Ross Armstrong. A former National Party official, Armstrong brought into TVNZ after a successful performance with state‐owned New Zealand Post. He had much in common with Jim Bolger, another key National Party figure and former Prime Minister. Bolger was appointed by the Labour‐Alliance coalition to head the Kiwi Bank, an Alliance initiative through which the state returns to the banking industry. Like Bolger, Armstrong was cultivated by Helen Clark as a member of the pragmatic wing of the National Party. His competence as an executive was the major reason for his various appointments, although his performance was not without controversy. Both Armstrong and Bolger provided a powerful signal of the Government's pragmatism, orientation to the centre and appeal to former National voters.</p>
         
         <p>Armstrong's mistake was to take it upon himself to advise the government on private‐public partnerships for infrastructure development. He organised a meeting attended by members of the cabinet on the basis of a document that urged companies to join an informal team and ‘get the inside running’ on big projects. This phrase was inserted into the document by one of his staff. Armstrong failed to read the document and remove a phrase that could be interpreted as implying inappropriate, if not corrupt, practices. The Government had no role in organising the meeting or preparing the document. It had to put some pressure on Armstrong to resign, but he did so before the affair did significant damage.</p>
         
         <p>The most damage to the credibility of all but one of the MPs was done by their agreement, late at night and with minimal debate, to retain control of parliamentary allowances. The Auditor‐General and an independent review appointed by Parliament had recommended that an independent body (the Remuneration Authority) acquire overall control of MPs’ allowances. A bill embodying those recommendations was sent to a select committee, but returned to the House completely changed. Powers held by the Remuneration Authority's forerunner, the Higher Salaries Commission, were instead to be transferred to the Speaker and Prime Minister. The new law did allow for greater transparency, with all allocations to be made public, but criticism was widespread. Only Rodney Hide, a long‐time crusader against ‘parliamentary perks’ voted against the new law.</p>
         
         <p>Nonetheless, by the end of 2002 satisfaction with democracy in New Zealand was perhaps somewhat higher. A petition calling for a referendum on the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system lapsed early in the year for lack of support. After the 2002 election, polling also indicated majority support for the MMP electoral system, established in New Zealand in 1996.</p>
