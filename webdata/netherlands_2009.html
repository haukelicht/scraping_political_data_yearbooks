         <p>In 2007 the Dutch government agreed to maintain troops in Afghanistan (as part of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF) until 2010. In December 2009, the American government asked the Dutch government to prolong its mission in some form after 2010. The Christian Democrats (<i>Christen Democratisch Appel</i>, CDA) were willing to reconsider the earlier decision, but the Social Democrats (<i>Partij van de Arbeid</i>, PvdA) insisted on a complete withdrawal in 2010. The third coalition partner, the small Christian Union (<i>Christen Unie</i>), had opposed prolongation but seemed willing to compromise. Tensions within the coalition increased in January 2010 (this was also due to other issues – in particular an inquiry about Dutch involvement in the Iraq War in 2003) (see also <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Lucardie &amp; Voerman 2010</a></span>: 1100). Attempts to reach a compromise between CDA and PvdA were thwarted by misunderstandings and mutual distrust. On 17 February the PvdA leader and vice‐premier, Wouter Bos, demanded that the cabinet reconfirm its decision to end the mission in its weekly meeting on 19 February. When the cabinet members of CDA and Christian Union refused, the PvdA ministers resigned (in the night of 19–20 February). An attempt by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende to reconstitute the cabinet failed, so early parliamentary elections became inevitable. Balkenende would lead a caretaker cabinet – for the third time in his political career.

         <p>In the Netherlands, municipal elections are held on the same day across the country and are often dominated by national parties and national issues. In 2010 the municipal elections took place on 3 March, 11 days after the collapse of the Government, so obviously they were interpreted in this context. The two major government parties, CDA and PvdA, both suffered substantial losses, the latter even more than the former. Another loser was the Socialist Party (<i>Socialistische Partij</i>, SP). The next day, the leader of the SP, Agnes Kant, resigned. She had succeeded the popular leader Jan Marijnissen in 2008 and had often been criticised for being too insistent and demanding in parliamentary debates. On 12 March, Bos resigned as leader of the PvdA. He said he wanted to give up his political career in order to spend more time with his family. He also nominated a successor, who should head the party list in the upcoming parliamentary elections: Job Cohen, the Mayor of Amsterdam. Balkenende did not resign as party leader, and was asked by the executive committee of the CDA to head the list – in spite of misgivings of some members. Other parties did not change leaders either, apart from the Political Reformed Party (<i>Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij</i>, SGP) where Bas van der Vlies did not seek re‐election after leading the party for 24 years.
         </p>
         
         <p>The campaign really started in late April. The polls initially predicted a close race between CDA, PvdA and the Freedom Party (<i>Partij voor de Vrijheid</i>, PVV) founded in 2006 by the former Liberal MP Geert Wilders, which combined nationalism with populism and a heavy emphasis on the dangers of ‘islamisation’. Yet since the fall of the Government, the support for the Christian Democrats began to wane, whereas sympathy for the Liberal Party (<i>Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie</i>, VVD) increased. In May, it looked like a neck‐and‐neck race between PvdA and VVD. Both parties traditionally ‘owned’ socio‐economic and financial issues, which dominated the campaign. All parties agreed on the need to reduce government spending, but they disagreed about the extent and the location of these reductions. The PvdA, SP and Green Left (<i>Groen Links</i>), as well as the Christian Union, wanted to reduce the tax deduction of mortgage payments and to increase taxes for higher income groups. The CDA, VVD and PVV opposed these measures. The latter two preferred to cut foreign aid to developing countries, whilst CDA and VVD as well as PvdA, Green Left and Democrats 66 (<i>Democraten 66</i>, D66) wanted to raise the minimum age for the state‐funded pension (<i>Algemene Ouderdomswet</i>, AOW) from 65 to 67.<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> This way to reduce government spending was opposed only by the PVV and SP. All parties proposed to reduce the number of civil servants and other state employees, but disagreed about the details. The Liberals proposed the most drastic cuts – about €20 billion in four years – while the left‐wing parties were more moderate. As always, the Christian Democrats tried to straddle a middle way between the Liberals and the left. Surprisingly, their leader turned the mortgage payment reduction into a ‘red line‐issue’: he would not compromise on this issue and accused the Liberal leader, Mark Rutte, of being too wishy‐washy here. Thus, mortgage payment reduction became the central issue in the campaign. D66‐leader Alexander Pechtold insisted on linking it to a wider reform of the housing market and subsidies for rented houses. He made Balkenende look rather stubborn and dogmatic. Foreign policy, European integration, energy policy and environmental issues did not figure very prominently in the campaign. Wilders, who did not clearly side with the right or the left on socio‐economic issues, tried to focus more attention on ‘his’ issues – Islam and immigration – arguing that the costs of ‘mass immigration’ were generally underestimated as a major cause of the financial crisis.
         </p>
         
         <p>In televised debates, Rutte tended to make the most favourable impression: articulate, relaxed, good‐humoured and self‐confident. Though more experienced, Balkenende seemed less relaxed. In one of the last debates, he complimented the (female) interviewer on her lovely appearance (‘<i>u kijkt zo lief</i>’), which was interpreted as a silly slip‐of‐the‐tongue, if not a male chauvinist remark. Cohen made a bad impression in most debates, unsure about figures and reacting too slowly to questions and interruptions, though he improved towards the end. Emile Roemer, who had succeeded Kant as leader of the SP, proved more at ease and at times quite witty.
         </p>
         
         <p>Election night was more exciting than usual in the Netherlands. It became clear only in the early morning that the VVD had beaten the PvdA by one seat (see <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a>). Even so, the Liberals had expected a little more. The VVD had become the largest party almost by default, with only 31 seats. Like other opposition parties it benefited from the cabinet crisis and the declining popularity of a government in economically troubled times. All three governing parties lost, but most of all the CDA. Half of its voters switched to other parties – or did not vote at all. The Christian Democrats reached an all‐time low: 21 seats. In the 1980s they had occupied more than 50 seats, while their predecessors had held 75 seats or more around 1960. The historical electoral decline could be explained in terms of secularisation, declining church attendance as well as weakening links between church and politics. A popular prime minister with a strong political profile could compensate for the loss of church‐going voters by attracting secular voters with conservative political ideas. Ruud Lubbers had done so in the 1980s, and Jan‐Peter Balkenende in 2002, 2003 and even 2006. Yet by 2010 he had lost his popularity. He had failed to prevent or control another cabinet crisis – the third in his political career. Perhaps some voters resented the fact that he had tried to govern with the PvdA. At any rate, exit polls suggest that the CDA lost (on balance) seven seats to the VVD, three to the PVV and two to D66 (<span title=""><a href="#b9" id="#b9R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Synovate 2010</a></span>; see also <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Van Kessel 2010</a></span>). About a sixth of their supporters did not vote, which may help to explain the relatively low turnout in 2010 compared to 2006. Quite a few supporters of the PvdA seem to have stayed at home, too. The Social Democrats also lost votes to D66 and the PVV. The Christian Union lost one seat – less than its partners in government, but more than it had expected. Some observers speculated that its voters did not always agree with the centre‐leftist position the party had adopted in recent years.

         <p>Most, but not all opposition parties benefited from the defeat of the government. The SP lost ten seats, mainly to the PvdA (two seats) and the Green Left (also two seats), but also (about three seats) to the PVV. Both PVV and SP are often regarded as populist protest parties, even though their platforms are rather different. The new SP leader, Roemer, did fairly well in the election debates, but could not equal the popularity of Jan Marijnissen, who had led the party from 1989 to 2008. Moreover, 2006 had been an exceptionally good election year for the Socialists. The more moderate opposition parties D66 and Green Left both recovered from earlier losses. The SGP won a few more votes than in 2006 but retained two seats. The Animal Rights Party (<i>Partij voor de Dieren</i>, PvdD) also maintained its two seats. The big winner was really the PVV, which went from nine to 24 seats and became the third‐largest party. It won voters from the CDA, SP, PvdA and VVD, but most of all from non‐voters. In the southern province of Limburg (the home of its leader) it became the largest party with 27 per cent of the popular vote. Yet it also did very well in other peripheral regions and in the largest cities. Like national‐populist parties in other European countries, it seemed to mobilise especially (though not exclusively) secular and male working‐class voters.
         </p>
         
         <p>New parties were not successful in 2010. The party Proud of the Netherlands (<i>Trots op Nederland</i>), founded by former VVD minister Rita Verdonk in 2007, won about 60 seats at the local elections but failed to win any seats in parliament.

         <p>Different coalition options had been discussed during the campaign, but even after the results were known, it was not clear what would happen. As usual, the largest party took the lead. The Queen appointed the Liberal senator and political science professor Uri Rosenthal <i>informateur</i> on 12 June. The first option he explored was a right‐wing coalition of VVD, CDA and PVV. Already after a week he decided this would not work, given the reluctance of the CDA. Next he would investigate two options: either a ‘centre coalition’ of CDA, PvdA and VVD or a ‘purple green’ coalition of VVD, PvdA, D66 and Green Left. A second <i>informateur</i> was appointed who had played a prominent role in the PvdA: first Herman Tjeenk Willink, vice‐president of the Council of State (<i>Raad van State</i>), and then Jacques Wallage, former leader of the parliamentary party of the PvdA and later mayor of Groningen. As PvdA leader Cohen seemed very reluctant to discuss a coalition with the Christian Democrats, the ‘purple green’ option appeared more attractive. Yet on 21 July Wallage and Rosenthal concluded that a coalition of VVD, PvdA, D66 and Green Left was impossible. The four parties failed to agree about spending cuts and the mortgage issue. The next option to be investigated was a minority coalition of VVD and CDA, supported by the PVV. In August, the negotiations almost stranded when two Christian Democratic MPs declared they could not accept collaboration with the PVV. Without their support, the minority government could count on only 74 out of 150 MPs. Yet after two months, and two more <i>informateurs</i>, the three parties reached an agreement. CDA and VVD agreed on a government programme, while the PVV signed a short agreement to support the government in four main areas: immigration, security, care for the elderly and financial policy. Immigration and security policies should become tougher; care for the elderly should be improved rather than reduced. The PVV did not insist on maintaining the minimum age of the state pension at 65. Moreover, the three parties ‘agreed to disagree’ about Islam: CDA and VVD regarded it as a religion, whereas the PVV considered it a political ideology.
         </p>
         
         <p>This construction of a minority government officially supported by a third party was unique in Dutch history. It was controversial, especially among Christian Democrats. The membership of the VVD seemed almost unanimously in favour of the agreement – and delighted that a party member would become prime minister for the first time since the party was founded (in 1948). The party congress of the CDA did approve the agreement on 2 October, but only after intense and often emotional debate. About one‐third of the 4,000 members present voted against the agreement, among them several former party leaders and former ministers. The two MPs who had opposed the agreement decided to accept the verdict of the party congress and give up their opposition. On 14 October, the Rutte I cabinet was sworn in by the Queen (see <a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink">Table 2</a>).
