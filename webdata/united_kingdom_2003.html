         <p>There were three by‐elections for the House of Commons, all in formerly Labour‐held seats of which two were retained (Birmingham Hodge Hill and Hartlepool) and one was lost to the Liberal Democrats (Leicester South).</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Election results</h2>
         
         <p>On 10 June there were elections to the European Parliament, the Greater London Assembly, the London Mayor and various local authorities in England and Wales. The results were mixed and their announcements staggered, allowing all parties to point to aspects that were positive for them. The first to be counted were the local elections, where the BBC national share of the vote projection (calculated using wards with three‐party competition and no significant others) put Labour, with 26 per cent, in third place for the first time since national share projections of this kind began. The Conservatives took a clear lead with 38 per cent, and the Liberal Democrats had 29 per cent. The Conservatives gained control of 13 councils and 232 seats, while Labour made a net loss of 9 councils and 468 seats. Although the Liberal Democrats increased their number of councillors, they lost control of two councils overall.</p>
         
         <p>The London mayoral election had more positive news for Labour as their candidate, Ken Livingstone, was re‐elected. However, this was not a clear victory for Labour since Livingstone was first elected as an independent candidate in 2000 after having failed to secure the Labour nomination in a process that seemed designed specifically to thwart him. To avoid a repeat of the embarrassment, Livingstone was brought back into the Labour fold on 6 January, but he campaigned primarily on his own terms and failed to mention his party affiliation in his advertisements. In the Greater London Assembly elections, the Conservatives, Labour and the Greens all suffered losses. The anti‐European United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), the Liberal Democrats and the extreme right British National Party (BNP) each made gains in either votes or seats. As in the European elections, the anti‐Iraq War party Respect did relatively well in London, taking 4.7 per cent of the second vote.</p>
         
         <p>The European Parliament (EP) election results were poor for both major parties; for the first time in the history of British party government the two main contenders failed to take half of the votes between them. Although the Conservatives came first, they were down 9 points from their 1999 performance. Meanwhile Labour saw its share of the national vote fall to the lowest level since 1910. The Scottish and Welsh nationalists were down by 7 and 12 points in their respective countries. In part this reflects their relative successes in June 1999, which came shortly after the first elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. The Scottish National Party leader, John Swinney, resigned and was succeeded by his predecessor Alex Salmond. The Green Party was down slightly in its share of the vote but kept both its seats.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberal Democrats were the only British party represented at Westminster to increase their representation and share of the vote. They did particularly well in highly educated and Muslim areas where disapproval of the Iraq War was relatively high. Yet it is more striking that the Liberal Democrats continued to perform noticeably less well in European than local elections, and, for the first time, they were pushed into third place by the dramatic rise of the anti‐European UKIP, whose share of the vote rose by 9 points, thereby matching the spectacular result by the Greens in the 1989 European elections. Indeed a large part of UKIP success seemed to be attributable to the media frenzy surrounding its candidate and former television chat‐show host, Robert Kilroy‐Silk, who has since formed and resigned from his own party (Veritas) after protracted and public battles over UKIP strategy and leadership. The electoral success of UKIP cannot, however, be simply dismissed as the product of one or more media personalities. Rather it is a clear reminder of the increasingly eurosceptic views of the British electorate. The extreme‐right BNP won 4.9 per cent of the vote; had seat allocation been conducted with Sainte‐Laguë instead of d’Hondt, or at a national instead of a regional level, then the BNP would have achieved representation in the European Parliament. The anti‐Iraq War Respect coalition, led by former Labour MP George Galloway, managed to win 4.8 per cent of the vote in London and over four times that in the two boroughs with the largest proportion of Muslims (Newham and Tower Hamlets), but overall its share was just 1.5 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>In Northern Ireland, there was a 2.3 per cent swing from the pro‐agreement Ulster Unionists to the anti‐agreement Democratic Unionists, while on the nationalist side there was a 10.6 per cent swing from the SDLP to Sinn Féin. The results further established the two more extreme parties as dominant within their communities.</p>
         
         <p>Turnout, at 38.5 per cent, was the highest ever for an EP election in Britain, thanks in part to concurrent local elections (including London) and the use of all‐postal ballots in the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber and East Midlands regions of England. The former seems to have added roughly 5 points and the latter 9 points to turnout in the areas were they occurred (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Curtice et al. 2005</a></span>). However, even where there were neither local elections nor all‐postal ballots, turnout still rose by 8 points, perhaps because of a mixture of disillusion with the government and greater media coverage, which focused on troubles with the administration of postal voting and the UKIP campaign.
         </p>
         
         <p>The short notice given to returning officers caused problems with administration, which together with accusations of fraud and a negative public reaction prompted the Electoral Commission to recommend that all‐postal ballots not be used again. It was too late, however, to change arrangements for the referendum on a North East regional assembly, which went ahead as an all‐postal ballot, resulting in a 78 per cent vote against the plans on a turnout of 48 per cent.</p>

         <p>The Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 establishes the use of the Single Transferable Vote system in Scottish local elections from 2007. This means that Scotland will be using four different electoral systems for European (closed list d’Hondt), United Kingdom (single member simple plurality), Scottish Parliament (mixed single member simple plurality with regional d’Hondt allocation) and local elections. Allowances received by MPs and peers were published for the first time in October 2004.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Labour, and particularly the Prime Minister, started the year in one of the weakest positions in the polls for over a decade. The average of the four polls published in January gave the Conservatives 36 per cent, Labour 38 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 20 per cent. Tony Blair faced two immediate battles. The Higher Education Bill, allowing universities in England and Wales to charge up to £3000 a year in ‘top‐up fees’, was passed on 27 January by just five votes and would otherwise have failed were it not for a late change of heart by a group of rebels. The Hutton Report on the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly was published the following day. The background to the report and proceedings of the enquiry were major events of 2003. Briefly, a story by a BBC correspondent, Andrew Gilligan, quoted an intelligence source, later revealed to be Dr Kelly, as saying that a dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been ‘sexed up’. The report criticised the BBC for failing to check Mr Gilligan's notes before responding to the government's denial of the claim, and also failing to realise that the notes did not support Gilligan's story even when they had been checked. Lord Hutton also criticised the lax editorial procedures that allowed the story to go on air unchecked. The BBC Director General Greg Dyke and the Chairman of Governors Gavyn Davies resigned. The government were largely exonerated.</p>
         
         <p>Many political observers were surprised by the tone of the Hutton Report and were (perhaps unrealistically) critical of its failure to comment on whether the intelligence evidence was sufficient to justify a war. As it became increasingly clear that weapons of mass destruction were unlikely ever to be found in Iraq and public pressure mounted, in February the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, established an inquiry into the accuracy of intelligence. On 14 July, the Butler Report found that key intelligence was unreliable and criticised MI6's (one of the British intelligence services) validation processes. The report criticised the government for failing to provide indications in its September 2002 dossier of the poor reliability of much of the intelligence. Striking comments was made about the Blair ‘sofa cabinet’ style of government being partly responsible. However, the report simultaneously concluded that both everyone and no individual were to blame. While the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the same questions effectively forced the resignation of the CIA chief, George Tenet, the Butler Report explicitly stated that Sir John Scarlett, the then head of the Joint Intelligence Committee and now the head of the Secret Intelligence Service, should not resign.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the European elections and the success of UKIP therein, debate on European integration declined after Tony Blair's conversion to the idea of a referendum on the Constitution for Europe. While this damaged Blair's reputation for consistency and perhaps his stated long‐term objective of reconciling Britain with Europe, it was a popular move and cut off an important line of opposition attack. After a scandal in which British embassies in Romania and Bulgaria were said to have granted ‘dodgy passports’, there was increased public concern at the prospect of large‐scale immigration from new European Union (EU) Member States after enlargement on 1 May. In response, the government announced that EU migrants would not be entitled to welfare benefits or housing, a position that had to be reviewed in light of the number of EU citizens already resident in the United Kingdom receiving such benefits. The level of immigration from the new Member States comfortably exceeded government expectations and opinion polls continued to report immigration and asylum as high on the list of public concerns.</p>
         
         <p>After increasing union pressure and threats of strikes, the government agreed a package of measures at a meeting in Warwick in July, including pension protection, better rights for temporary and agency workers, and more statutory holidays. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's pre‐budget report in December included funds to limit council tax rises and improve childcare provision.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout much of the year there was mounting speculation as to whether Tony Blair would stand down as Prime Minister in favour of Gordon Brown. On 1 October, shortly after receiving treatment for a heart condition, Tony Blair announced that he would stay on as Prime Minister for a ‘full third term’ but would not seek a fourth.</p>
         
         <p>On 16 November, the government published proposals for a smoking ban in most enclosed public places in England and Wales, including offices, factories and restaurants, cafes and pubs serving food. It was striking that the plans did not match those announced just one week earlier by the Scottish Executive for a complete ban on smoking in public places.</p>
         
         <p>A bill banning hunting with packs of hounds, repeatedly rejected by the House of Lords, was passed in November using the Parliament Act, which allows the government to force a bill through without the agreement of the Lords if it has been introduced and rejected by the Lords in two separate Parliamentary terms.</p>
         
         <p>On 16 December, the House of Lords Judicial committee judged that the powers given to the Home Secretary to indefinitely detain without trial foreign nationals suspected of involvement in international terrorism under Part 4 of the Anti‐Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 were discriminatory, disproportionate to the threat faced by the United Kingdom and incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The powers will remain in force until they were reviewed in 2005.</p>
         
         <p>A series of talks aimed at re‐establishing the peace process and the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland ended in failure in December over the issue of whether photographs could be taken of IRA weapons decommissioning and continuing criminal activities of paramilitaries. Shortly after the collapse of negotiations, £26m (US$47m) was stolen from the Northern Bank in Belfast. Although Sinn Féin denied any IRA involvement, Chief Constable Hugh Orde said that in his opinion, ‘the Provisional IRA were responsible for this crime and all main lines of inquiry currently undertaken are in that direction’. For the DUP this was yet more evidence that republicans were not serious about renouncing violence.</p>
         
         <p>The government had a more comfortable lead in the polls at the end of the year, with the average of the six polls in December 2004 putting the Conservatives at 32 per cent, Labour at 37 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 22 per cent. The prevailing view among commentators was that Blair had survived a relatively tough period and emerged strengthened.</p>
