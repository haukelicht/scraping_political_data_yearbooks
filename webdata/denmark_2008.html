         <p>There was a change in the Act of Succession on June 7, whereby the firstborn, regardless of gender, can assume the throne (see below).</p>

         <p>All of the parties in the Folketing, with the sole exception of the Red‐Green Alliance, reached a political settlement on a bank relief package in January in response to the financial crisis. The settlement involved DKK 120 billion, which the Danish state provided in the form of subordinated loan capital. It also included a ban on exercising stock options as long as the individual bank had loaned state capital, and banks were only allowed to deduct half of the directors' salaries for tax purposes. Finally, the Danish FSA was strengthened with respect to increasing the monitoring of financial and credit institutions. From the perspective of party politics, it was interesting to note that SF, the Socialist People's Party, supported the settlement.</p>
         
         <p>The next major case on the political agenda was taxation reform. On January 29, the Social Democrats and SF presented a joint taxation proposal with general principles for green and socially balanced tax reform. The joint proposal was accompanied by a political agreement that the two parties remain united during the impending negotiations. The Social Liberals had been invited to participate in this proposal, but they preferred to come up with their own tax policy. The alliance between the Social Democrats and SF now stood strongest in the opposition, while the Social Democrat–Social Liberal alliance, which the Social Liberals officially were working for, faded into the background.</p>
         
         <p>In February, the government presented its tax reform proposal. The reform was not to be fully financed from the outset, and the government counted on being able to contribute to boosting the economy from 2010. At the presentation of these plans, the Prime Minister emphasised that there were three requirements that had to be fulfilled by the parties taking part in tax reform. First, they had to accept that the so‐called ‘tax stop’ was to be re‐introduced immediately after the passage of the reform; second, the reform was to be underfinanced in the first few years; and third, the negotiations regarding the reform were to be conducted in just a few days. All of this made clear that the government was aiming at a settlement involving only the Danish People's Party. The settlement was reached in March.</p>
         
         <p>In the Danish context, where coalition governments traditionally work for broad settlements on major issues, it is somewhat remarkable that such a narrow settlement covered an area as important as tax policy, entailing the loss of the stability that would have resulted from a broad settlement with a long horizon. Here, the much‐celebrated Danish consensus democracy fell short, almost guaranteeing that tax policy will be a source of conflict leading up to the next parliamentary election.</p>
         
         <p>There had been sustained rumours for many months that Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen was a candidate for a top international position, either in the EU or NATO. At a NATO ambassadors meeting on 2 April, prior to a NATO summit, his candidacy for the post of secretary general was finally announced officially. His tenure as prime minister was clearly coming to an end, as it was inconceivable that he could continue even in the event that he did not get the job. It was yet to be determined whether Turkey would oppose his appointment, so the announcement was a make‐or‐break gamble. Anders Fogh Rasmussen was officially appointed NATO secretary general on April 4 and took office on August 1 – the highest international post ever occupied by a Danish citizen.</p>
         
         <p>Denmark needed a new prime minister. As there was no majority against the government continuing, Finance Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen was appointed Prime Minister on April 5, leading a Liberal–Conservative coalition government. This was only the fifth time since 1945 that Denmark found itself with a new prime minister without first carrying out a parliamentary election. The subsequent reshuffling of the government was limited. Claus Hjorth Frederiksen was appointed Finance Minister, Inger Støjberg the Minister of Employment and Gender Equality, and Karen Ellemann Minister for the Interior and Social Welfare. Løkke Rasmussen's first cabinet thus became the government with the greatest percentage of female ministers in the history of Danish democracy. This reshuffling of the cabinet paradoxically signalled ‘business as usual’. There was no reason to expect major political initiatives any time soon. Moreover, the government was to host the much‐anticipated UN Climate Change Conference towards the end of the year, and there was a tacit understanding between the government and the opposition that it was important that the conference be a success. There seemed to be a kind of truce regarding domestic politics for the rest of the year. However, the Climate Change Conference did not turn out to be the success for which Denmark had hoped.</p>
         
         <p>There was little political vision in the debate leading up to the European Parliament (EP) elections on June 7, where 13 candidates were to be elected from Denmark; one less than in the 2004 election. The election was marked by a considerable sense of <i>déjà vu</i>. The individual candidates obviously worked for their respective key issues, but the media coverage of the election failed to find issues that really resonated with voters. However, the campaign was marked less than previous EP elections by the question of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the EU as such. Instead, debate centred around how active the EU ought to be with respect to setting common standards, common rules and coordinating joint measures against, for example, the financial and climate crises, as well as the extent of the role that the EU and EP should play relative to national governments and parliaments.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Folketing had decided to change the Act of Succession so that the firstborn child of the monarch would succeed to the throne irrespective of his or her gender. The reform was to proceed according to the rules in effect for constitutional reform. In other words, it was to be passed by two successive parliaments separated by a parliamentary election. That had happened. Moreover, the reform was to be put to a referendum, where a majority was required for the reform – a majority constituting at least 40 per cent of those eligible to vote. The referendum took place on the same day as the EP election and there was a clear majority for reform. The referendum had a beneficial effect on the EP election turnout, which was the highest in Europe (when excluding the countries with obligatory voting) and the highest ever in Denmark at 59.5 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>In terms of history, the most important result was that the so‐called ‘June Movement’ (<i>JuniBevægelsen</i>) failed to win a seat, and that the People's Movement Against the EU (<i>Folkebevægelsen mod EU</i>) was unable to pick up their votes. However, the People's Movement did record modest electoral gains and was therefore able to maintain its single seat. Support for the classic opposition towards the EU was thus considerably reduced. Denmark had previously distinguished itself from other EU countries in terms of having two parties that only ran for election to the EP and not to the national parliament. In their heyday, they enjoyed support from roughly 25 per cent of the electorate. No longer can it be said, then, that Denmark has two separate party systems: one for national elections and another for EP elections. Danish voters now orient themselves much more towards the parties in the Folketing than to the popular movements. Consequently, the June Movement declared that its <i>raison d'être</i> had evaporated and that the time had come for the movement to fold.
         </p>
         
         <p>In June, all of the parties in the Folketing – with the sole exception of the Red‐Green Alliance – reached agreement on defence policy. Politically, this defence settlement was historic as it was the first time that SF had ever approved such an agreement. This eradicated yet another barrier in the way of SF participating in a coming government. And importantly, even if government participation were not to materialise, then at least SF would have a seat at the table when the details of the defence accord were to be negotiated. This raised concern amongst Liberals and the Conservatives and particularly the Danish People's Party, who had deliberately attempted to keep SF outside of the settlement. However, the Minister of Defence stood his ground as regards the benefits of keeping the settlement as broad as possible: doing so, he argued, provided the best and most certain support for Danish soldiers in Afghanistan.</p>
         
         <p>Since the Folketing election in 2007, SF had deliberately attempted to maximise its chances of joining a future government by leaning towards the middle of the political spectrum. This was made evident by its vote in support of the right‐of‐centre government's budget and its participation in a number of other settlements, including agreements on the finance, defence and traffic policy areas as well as distinguishing itself in tax, immigration, justice and EU policy. Support for the party in the opinion polls increased considerably.</p>
         
         <p>One of SF's organisational characteristics was the widespread member democracy, typified by the by the ability of its members to elect and influence the powerful national committee without whose approval SF MPs were not free to enter into significant written political agreements with other parties. The continual involvement of the members thus results in a relatively hard‐going decision‐making process. The party leadership therefore proposed streamlining the party organisation and making it more efficient in order to give the everyday leadership and the MPs greater room and power to act – a necessary condition, they believed, for the party being able to operate effectively at the high tempo at which politics proceeded, especially in government. The proposal involved converting the 39‐person national committee and the nine‐person executive committee into a single governing body of 17 members.</p>
         
         <p>This proposal was subject to lively debate and some strong criticism at the party's national assembly in April. Clearly, this touched the very roots of the party. The debate ended with a 224–166 vote in favour of the proposal, resulting in a shift in the balance of power between the membership organisation, the group of MPs and the party leadership to the benefit of the latter. Membership democracy was toned down and the top‐down steering increased. The leadership could now negotiate the basis for forming a government coalition together with the Social Democrats and the Social Liberal Party without having to continuously return to the party members to receive approval for each and every agreement.</p>
         
         <p>The other major theme at the national assembly was the debate and passage of a reform programme aimed at establishing the basis for the negotiations for forming a government programme. Such a programme could simultaneously be perceived as a supplement to the principle programme passed in 2003 – which referred to a revolutionary process whereby a majority in the population gradually abolished capitalism – though without being an actual new principle programme. In the reform programme, the socialistic objectives concerning a break with capitalism had been removed and replaced with mentions of a number of key issues that were assumed to have broad appeal to the general public, such as the climate, green growth and welfare. The ambition to introduce a form of financial democracy in private corporations was slightly controversial. The reform package was passed.</p>
         
         <p>On 17 November, elections were held in 98 municipalities and five regions. Some 9,051 candidates fought for election to 2,468 seats in 98 municipal councils, while 1,102 candidates competed for 205 seats in five regional councils. The 65.8 per cent election turnout was the lowest since 1974. Despite the disparity between the 98 municipal political agendas and the national political agenda, there is nevertheless a tendency in the media and among the voters to regard the municipal elections as a kind of mid‐term election. In this perspective, it was the opposition parties in the Folketing who enjoyed the best election thanks to SF, which doubled its share of the vote from 7.4 to 14.5 per cent, more than making up for the Social Democrats sliding from 34.3 to 30.7 per cent. The Liberals slipped from 27.5 to 24.8 per cent, while the Conservatives were able to make modest gains and secure 0.7 per cent more of the popular vote for 11.0 per cent, while the government's supporting party, the Danish People's Party, went from 5.9 to 8.1 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The battles for mayoralties and the other important positions in the municipalities and regions started on election night itself. As the parliamentary principle does not apply in the local and regional councils, these agreements apply for the next four years and are therefore extremely important. Deals are often made which break with the traditional patterns of cooperation between the parties, and individuals are often cynically viewed as pursuing their personal interests at the expense of the party. The last of the agreements finally fell into place in December. When the dust had settled, the Social Democrats were left standing with 50 mayors (a gain of four) and had reinforced their position as the largest party in Denmark on the municipal level; they clearly stood above the Liberals, who lost five mayors and were left with 30. Of the two primary adversaries on the national political level, the Social Democrats stood stronger than the Liberals after the municipal elections. Obviously, national and municipal politics are distinct, even though the differences have shrunk somewhat since the amalgamation of municipalities as part of the 2005 structural reform, reducing the number of municipalities from 271 to 98.</p>
         
         <p>When the Danish government named Climate Minister Connie Hedegaard (Conservative) as its candidate for the EU Commission, she had to withdraw from the government on November 24. She was replaced by Lykke Friis (Liberal). In practice, Hedegaard maintained responsibility for the Global Climate until the end of the year in order to be able to complete her work with the climate summit in December.</p>
         
         <p>The general conclusion regarding developments in 2009 must be that the government's position remained unchanged and that it was now up to the new Prime Minister to maintain it. He was confronted by an opposition which gradually – though still with difficulty – stood together more than had previously been the case and a political agenda that was clearly impacted by a financial and economic crisis leading to falling economic growth, increasing unemployment and pressure on state finances.</p>
