         <p>The main event in Norwegian political life in 2013 was the parliamentary election on 9 September. The sitting centre‐left coalition was defeated. Extensive negotiations between the centre‐right parties led to the formation of a new government that included the two parties on the right of Norwegian politics: the Conservative Party and the Progress Party. The two centrist parties (the Liberals and the Christian Democrats) supported, but did not join, the new government.</p>

         <p>The parliamentary elections on 9 September 2013 resulted in the election defeat of the ‘red‐green’ coalition of the Labour Party, the Centre Party and the Socialist Left Party, which had been in government since 2005. The opposition win at the election came as no big surprise. According to opinion polls, the four opposition parties had been in the lead for a long time. Led by Prime Minister candidate Erna Solberg, the Conservative Party obtained a clear majority in parliament. Prime Minster Jens Stoltenberg immediately acknowledged the defeat of his cabinet and announced on 14 October during the state budget presentation in parliament that his government would resign.</p>
         
         <p>The three red‐green parties lost a combined 7.4 points of the popular vote, dropping their total share to 40.4 per cent. Labour remained the largest party in parliament, but it experienced a significant drop in support (4.6 points). The Centre Party lost less than a percentage point, but it was the worst result ever for the party. By 2013, the Socialist Left Party had paid dearly for government participation. The party was just able to stay above the 4 per cent threshold for compensatory seats – a dramatic decline from their all‐time high of 12.5 per cent in the 2001 election. Having been the issue owner on environmental issues, the Socialist Left also suffered from the success of the Green Party in 2013. Some opinion polls during the campaign showed the Greens crossing the 4 per cent threshold for compensatory seats, but the party ended up with 2.8 per cent of the vote and one elected representative. Prior to 2013, Norway had been one of the few countries in Western Europe without pure Green Party representation in parliament.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives increased their share of the vote by almost 10 points to 26.8 per cent (their best result since 1985) and they were the unquestioned winners in the election. In contrast, the Progress Party lost almost seven points and obtained only 16.3 per cent of the total vote. Hence, although the Progress Party was part of the winning side and – as is elaborated below – ended up joining the government, this was far from a good result for the party. Both the success of the Conservatives and the relatively bad result of the Progress Party can to some extent be traced back to the terror attacks of 22 July 2011. Although the Progress Party's anti‐immigration platform is far removed from the ideology of the terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, the party dropped significantly at the polls during autumn 2011, and it did not manage to win back all the lost votes. The Conservatives have been the main beneficiaries of the Progress Party's decreasing support.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberals and the Christian Democrats contributed to the opposition's electoral victory. Although both parties were close to the 4 per cent threshold for compensatory seats in the opinion polls, both obtained more than 5 per cent of the vote in the election. This result meant that the Conservatives and the Progress Party needed at least one of the two smaller parties to obtain a majority in the <i>Storting</i>.
         </p>
         
         <p>Although several factors can contribute to explaining these results, it is a fair assumption that the red‐green alliance suffered from the ‘wear and tear of government’ – that is, the tendency of governing parties to lose support at the polls (Narud &amp; Valen <span><a href="#epdy12062-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12062-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>). The re‐election of the red‐green alliance in the last parliamentary election in 2009 is best understood in light of the financial crisis (Allern <span><a href="#epdy12062-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12062-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2010</a></span>). In 2013, the threat of the crisis was less salient for voters, and although the state of the economy was good and the employment rates were high, the incumbent parties received little benefit.
         </p>
         
         <p>Turnout in 2013 was 78.2 per cent – an increase of 1.8 points and the highest total since 1997. The relatively high turnout could be due to dissatisfaction with the red‐green government and the consequent mobilisation for the opposition parties. However, as described above, the election was never close. Rather, much of the rise can be explained by the increasing participation of younger voters: turnout increased 10.3 points for first‐time voters aged 18–21 (a figure that is almost matched by the 22–25 year‐old age group). Both the terror attacks on Utøya at a Labour Party youth camp in 2011 and media campaigns directed at young voters most likely contributed to this increase.</p>
         
         <p>As usual, the media coverage of the campaign was dominated by the campaign itself. To some extent the media framed the campaign as a two‐horse race between the two prime minister candidates, Jens Stoltenberg and Erna Solberg. However, there was never any real chance of the red‐green alliance maintaining their majority in parliament. Hence, media coverage was to an even greater extent focused on the different coalition alternatives, and especially on speculation about which of the four opposition parties would join the new government after the election.</p>
         
         <p>As in 2009, and different from earlier elections, coverage was not focused on one or two issues. Rather, media attention was spread across several issues. In addition to the environment and administrative efficiency, attention was given to welfare issues, especially the educational and health systems, and care for the elderly. The voter agenda also appeared to reflect the diverse media agenda. Traditionally, Norwegian voters have mostly agreed on one or two important issues. In 2009, a more varied voter agenda emerged (Karlsen &amp; Aardal <span><a href="#epdy12062-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12062-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>), and reports suggest a similar pattern for 2013.

         <p>The red‐green alliance did not present the voters with a joint political platform before the election, and they placed more emphasis on party differences than in 2005 and 2009. Still, they emphasised that they offered voters a more viable majority government alternative than the opposition. The four opposition parties did not establish a pre‐electoral agreement or alliance before the election campaign. The Liberal Party and the Christian People's Party, the two centrist parties, would not commit to entering into government with the Progress Party. The Progress Party's anti‐immigration stance was the main obstacle for such a coalition since the two centrist parties have more liberal immigration policies. Other policy issues were also raised in this context, such as the Progress Party's stance on government expenditures. The party has long held that the Norwegian government should spend more of its oil fortune, which is currently being saved in a pension fund, on infrastructure, health care and other policy fields. The Conservative Party, on the other hand, strongly advocates a more restrictive spending policy.</p>
         
         <p>These and other policy differences between the four centre‐right parties led to a constant debate about the difficulty of forming a coalition after the election. Although the Liberals and the Christian Democrats publicly committed to cooperating to replace the red‐green government, they refrained from pledging to join a government that included the Progress Party. The currently ruling centre‐left parties exploited this problem, pointing to the lack of a clear alternative on the centre‐right side. However, all parties agreed upon Erna Solberg as the Prime Minister candidate, and they all treated each other with respect during the campaign. The actual composition of the government was left to be decided after the election.</p>
         
         <p>When the results came in, it became clear that the Progress Party and the Conservative Party would need the support of at least one of the two parties in the centre to get a majority in the <i>Storting</i>. On 16 September, all four parties, represented by the party leaders and their advisers, started so‐called ‘exploratory talks’ (<i>sonderinger</i>). The Conservatives preferred a government consisting of all four parties. Without the Liberals and Christian Democrats in government, the Conservatives would first have to compromise towards the right in government, and then back towards the centre in parliament. In addition, a four‐party government would ensure future collaboration of the parties. Nevertheless, after two weeks of exploratory talks it was announced that only the Conservatives and the Progress Party would be part of the government, and they alone would start the ‘real negotiations’. No specific issue was highlighted as the reason that all parties did not join the government, but as described above there are major political differences on key issues between the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Progress Party.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nonetheless, the four parties signed a written agreement that formalised their collaboration and included specific policy compromises. One week later, the Conservatives and Progress Party presented a coalition agreement between the two parties. On 16 October the new cabinet was appointed, and Solberg became Norway's second female Prime Minister. Progress Party leader Siv Jensen was appointed Minister of Finance. In addition, the Progress Party received six more ministerial posts, while the Conservatives got 11 ministers. All Norwegian cabinets since Gro Harlem Brundtland's so‐called ‘female cabinet’ in 1986 have been nearly gender balanced, and Solberg's government was no different, consisting of nine women and nine men.</p>

         <p>The terrorist attacks at the government headquarters in Oslo and the Labour Party youth camp at Utøya on 22 July 2011 continued to impact Norwegian politics in 2013. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, support for the Labour Party soared, while the right‐wing populist Progress Party lost some of its voters. Both effects were evident in the local elections in autumn 2011. The main problem for the Progress Party was not the oft‐publicised fact that the culprit behind the attacks, Anders Behring Breivik, had once been a member of the party. Voters did not blame the Progress Party for Breivik's atrocities. However, the muted tone of the 2011 election campaign, in which the issue of immigration was not discussed, did not fit well with the Progress Party image, and so they lost support (Bergh &amp; Bjørklund <span><a href="#epdy12062-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12062-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In 2012, the debate shifted. The report from the 22 July commission presented a strong critique of the country's preparedness for and response to the terrorist attacks (Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy12062-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12062-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>). In autumn 2012, hearings were held in the <i>Storting</i> (parliamentary) committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs, in which Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg testified, among others. This testimony was the first of its kind for a sitting Norwegian Prime Minister. The committee delivered its report in February 2013. It contained a scathing critique of the sitting government, but it stopped short of calling for the resignation of the government or any cabinet ministers. Most commentators at the time argued that the report would have called for the resignation of former Minister of Justice Knut Storberget had he not resigned in November 2011.<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12062-note-0007_11-controller" href="#epdy12062-note-0007_11" aria-controls="epdy12062-note-0007_11" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Link to Note">1</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12062-note-0007_11" aria-labelledby="epdy12062-note-0007_11-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>Several top bureaucrats had also resigned before the report from the 22 July commission was made public.<span class="chevronDown"></span></span> All political parties in the <i>Storting</i>, including Labour and its two coalition partners, the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party, voted for a strong rebuke of the government.
         </p>
         
         <p>The various reports on the 22 July attacks received widespread media attention and shifted the debate on the tragedy from one of unambiguous sympathy with the Labour Party to a general consensus that Norway was ill‐prepared for the attacks. In a sense, this point was underlined, though in a different context, when a Norwegian‐owned oil installation in In Amenas, Algeria, was attacked by Islamic terrorists in January 2013. Five Norwegian citizens, employees of the government‐owned oil company Statoil, were killed in the attacks. The issue of preparedness for terrorism came up again, but in a way that was less critical of the sitting government.</p>
         
         <p>Although terrorism preparedness was a major issue in 2013, it was not used in a direct way by the opposition parties. Some of the parties in opposition could also be criticised for not doing enough to prepare the country for emergencies in the years they held government office. Moreover, the 22 July attacks remained a sensitive issue for which it was difficult to criticise the Labour Party, since they were also victimised. An incident in a televised debate during the election campaign offers a case in point. The leader of the opposition, Erna Solberg (of the Conservative Party, Høyre), attacked Prime Minister Stoltenberg for not providing adequate leadership. This was seen as an indirect reference to the government's lack of preparedness for terrorism. Solberg was widely criticised for her statements, which were seen as too harsh a critique of Stoltenberg and the Labour Party.</p>
         
         <p>The Labour Party also had to deal with a scandal that started in 2011 and dragged on for almost two years, finally reaching its conclusion in September 2013. It concerned Rune Øygard, a high‐profile Labour Party mayor in the municipality of Vågå in the central part of southern Norway. Øygard was seen as a rising star in the party, and he was close to the party leadership, including the Prime Minister. He was accused of, and eventually convicted of, sexually abusing a teenage girl. The case received massive media attention as it proceeded through various judicial appeals, until the final verdict was handed down by the Norwegian Supreme Court. However, the scandal had a limited effect on the reputation of the Labour Party.</p>
         
         <p>The immigration issue came up several times in public debate in 2013. There were particularly heated debates regarding Norway's treatment of asylum‐seeking children. The government's expulsion of children who had spent most of their lives in Norway provoked major protests. However, there is a strong majority in the <i>Storting</i> favouring a strict policy toward those who fail to meet the criteria for asylum. Therefore, the protests have not led to a major change in policy.<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12062-note-0008_12-controller" href="#epdy12062-note-0008_12" aria-controls="epdy12062-note-0008_12" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Link to Note">2</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12062-note-0008_12" aria-labelledby="epdy12062-note-0008_12-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>The Christian Democratic Party and the Liberal Party managed to get some concessions from the new government on this front in negotiations after the election. However, the agreement was limited in scope, and it only applied to a small number of the asylum seekers marked for expulsion.<span class="chevronDown"></span></span></p>
         
         <p>A related issue, which concerned the conditions of people of Roma background living in Norway, generated some debate throughout 2013. Some argued that the poor living conditions and lack of housing for the Roma should be addressed. Others saw the increase of panhandling in the streets of Norway's cities as a problem. Both the Conservatives and the Progress Party favour a ban on panhandling, but the issue has not yet been raised in the <i>Storting</i>.
