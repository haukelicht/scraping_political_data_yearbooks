         <p>As federal cabinet members cannot sit in any parliament, assigned ministers and secretaries of state, most of whom are elected MPs or senators, had to resign upon cabinet formation. However, as most of them were already part of the Leterme II cabinet, there were not that many resignations. In the House of Representatives, the most notable exception is E. Di Rupo (PS), the new Prime Minister, who was replaced by B. Van Grootenbrulle. The same occurred with less prominent politicians such as H. Bogaert (CD&amp;V, replaced by B. Slegers), S. Verherstraeten (CD&amp;V, replaced by K. Waterschoot) and M. De Block (Open VLD, replaced by L. Van Biesen). In the Senate, J. Vande Lanotte (SP.a) had to resign in favour of D. Douifi, and F. Vandenbroucke (SP.a) resigned in favour of F. Talhaoui. Following the split of the FDF away from the MR (see<b> Issues in national politics</b> below), the three FDF MPs, B. Clairfayt, O. Maingain and. D. Thiéry, left the MR parliamentary group.

         <p>The whole year was marked by the prolongation of very tense negotiations to form a government after the 13 June 2010 elections (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy3-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 917–918). J. Vande Lanotte (SP.a), who had been nominated by the King as mediator on 21 October 2010, issued a proposal on 3 January. Five of the seven parties involved in the negotiations agreed to Vande Lanotte's proposal: the French‐speaking PS, CDH and Ecolo, and the Flemish SP.a and Groen!, but the Flemish N‐VA and CD&amp;V rejected it. Therefore, on 6 January, Vande Lanotte submitted his resignation to the King, who rejected this request and asked B. De Wever (N‐VA) and E. Di Rupo (PS) to help Vande Lanotte reach an agreement. This could not be achieved and, on 26 January, Vande Lanotte was relieved of his mission by the King.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 2 February, the King appointed D. Reynders, acting Finance Minister (MR), as ‘informateur’ – a mission extended to 1 March. On the basis of the Reynders report, the King one day later appointed W. Beke (CD&amp;V) as ‘négociateur’ to find an agreement on state reform. On 12 May, Beke asked to be relieved of his mission and, four days later, E. Di Rupo (PS) was appointed ‘formateur’, with the task of forming a coalition. He presented a negotiation proposal on 5 July. As the NV‐A rejected it immediately, Di Rupo tendered his resignation on 9 July. The King refused it and asked him to carry on the negotiations.</p>
         
         <p>From 15 July onwards, new negotiations started without the N‐VA, but included the CD&amp;V who had previously refused to take part in the discussions without the N‐VA, and the Liberal parties (Open VLD and MR). On 15 September, a deal was finally reached on the issue of the splitting of the Brussels‐Halle‐Vilvoorde (BHV) constituency. It led, on 11 October, to an agreement on the state reform between the Flemish parties (CD&amp;V, Open VLD, SP.A, Groen!) and the French‐speaking parties (PS, MR, CDH and Ecolo). The agreement included the splitting of BHV; more fiscal autonomy for the Regions; the transfer of competencies in the fields of health, employment and justice to Regions and Communities; and the reform of the finance law in order to provide them with more autonomous financial means.</p>
         
         <p>The next step was to attempt a coalition. It excluded the Green parties Groen! and Ecolo, as requested by the Open VLD. An agreement on the 2012 budget was reached on 26 November. The new coalition was sworn in by the King on 6 December 2011, 541 days after the June 2010 elections (i.e., the longest political crisis of the kind in postwar Europe). The governmental agreement included the state reform as agreed in October, a public finances consolidation, social and economic reforms implying a rise in the retirement age, cuts in health care and in unemployment benefits, and reform in the fields of justice, migration and asylum.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy3-sec-0004-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Contrary to 2010 (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy3-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 918–920), the never‐ending government formation barely intervened in parties' leadership structures. On the Flemish side, the party presidents of the Flemish Christian‐Democrats, Liberals and Greens did not change, nor were they really contested internally as in the end their parties seemed satisfied with the role they played in the formation process. The Flemish socialists (SP.a) elected a new leader, B. Tobback (his father had also been party leader and Vice Prime Minister). As the only candidate, he obtained 96.9 per cent of member votes. N‐VA party president B. De Wever, the architect of the 2010 electoral landslide, media face of the party and key formation negotiator, was also re‐elected as the only candidate with 99.4 per cent of member votes.
         </p>
         
         <p>By contrast, the internal crisis of the Vlaams Belang, triggered by the 2010 electoral defeat, widened. The authoritarian leadership and anti‐Islam rhetoric of hardliner P. Dewinter were challenged by the highly mediatised death of M‐R. Morel, a soft‐line dissident and wife of former president F. Van Hecke. Her funeral was exploited by her former fellow traveller, N‐VA leader De Wever. Van Hecke left the party (as did the son of party founder Dillen), and so did many lower level moderate elites (the party now scores less than 10 per cent of the Flemish vote in the polls).</p>
         
         <p>Note that in several Flemish parties, former leaders with large followings beyond their party quit politics as a profession at a (relatively) young age, including former Prime Minister Y. Leterme. This raised concerns about the apparent increasing replacement of self‐made ‘politicians by vocation’ with ‘politicians by pedigree’ (sons and daughters of politicians) and non‐political media celebrities.</p>
         
         <p>On the francophone side, among the main parties, the MR went through the most difficult time. It has consisted of the aggregation of three parties (PRL, FDF and MCC) since 1998. In late September, the FDF component left the party and chose to continue as an autonomous party. The FDF (French‐speaking Federalist Democrats Front/<i>Fédéralistes Démocrates Francophones</i> under the name adopted in January 2010, previously known as French‐speaking Democratic Front/<i>Front Démocratique Francophone</i>), as a party dedicated to the defence of French‐speaking interests in and around Brussels, was unhappy with the institutional reform agreements being negotiated. This divorce caused the loss of three MPs for the MR (there were no elected senators under the FDF banner).
         </p>
         
         <p>Other parties went through quite smooth leadership transitions – particularly the PS where T. Giet replaced E. di Rupo (the new Prime Minister) and the CDH where the historical party leader and founder (since 2002) J. Milquet, Vice Prime Minister in the Di Rupo I cabinet, was replaced by B. Lutgen on 1 September. Finally, on 2 February, L. Louis, the single MP of the newly formed French‐speaking radical right populist party, the <i>Parti Populaire</i> (PP), decided to defect from his party and create his own <i>Mouvement pour la Liberté et la Démocratie</i> (MLD). This decision resulted from personal disputes with PP leaders R. Aernoudt and M. Modrikamen.
         </p>
         
         <p>With regards to substantive political issues, as a result of the protracted political crisis, the mandate of the caretaker government Leterme II was expanded, with many socioeconomic and finance issues high on the agenda. The 2011 budget, the first ever proposed by a caretaker coalition, was adopted by the House of Representatives on 19 May. It presented a deficit of 3.6 per cent, slightly better than originally planned. In February, as two of the three national trade unions (FGTB/ABVV and CGSLB/ACLVB) rejected the collective bargaining agreement, the government had to intervene. It decided among other things to maintain the automatic cost‐of‐living adjustments mechanism and to fix the payroll standard at 0.3 per cent (cost‐of‐living adjustments excluded) for 2011–2012. It also made appointments of senior administrative officials. A major one was that of L. Coene as Governor of the National Bank. The government entrusted the National Bank with the mission of controlling the integrity of financial markets.</p>
         
         <p>On 10 October, the government, rushing to support the Dexia Bank Belgian unit, decided to nationalise it. The dismantled Franco‐Belgian Bank was the first bank to fall victim to the two year‐old eurozone debt crisis. Belgium paid €4 billion to buy this largely retail Belgian division (four million customers) as part of a restructuring of the bank which faced a severe liquidity squeeze.</p>
         
         <p>Overall, the socioeconomic climate was grim, with high figures for bankruptcies and closures of businesses, including closure of two new blast furnaces by ArcelorMittal in the Liège area, signaling the ending of the liquid phase steel production in the region and resulting in protests and strikes. At the end of the year, the social climate was agitated. The country was paralysed by a general strike on 7 October against the measures envisaged for the social security system by the negotiators of the coming coalition. On 2 December, a national demonstration organised by the trade unions gathered 80,000 workers. On 15 December, after the new coalition was formed and had precipitously forced the passage of a law increasing the retirement age, all main unions called for a national general strike on 30 January 2012.</p>
         
         <p>On the issue of undocumented immigrants continuing to be confronted with judicial repression and internment in closed centres, new accommodation networks were created. Finally, in March, invoking humanitarian purposes, the government, although being a caretaker one, did not hesitate to take part in the military intervention to subdue Gaddafi's regime: the F‐16s of the Belgian Air Force participated under NATO command in the bombing of Libya.</p>
