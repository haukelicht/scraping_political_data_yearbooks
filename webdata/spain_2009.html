         <p>A year after the legislative elections in which Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero was re‐elected, he decided upon a major reshuffle of his cabinet, although the Minister of Justice had been replaced in February due to a political scandal. Five ministers stepped down, one changed her post inside the cabinet and six entered for the first time. The Prime Minister also restructured and renamed several government departments. First, the Ministry of Public Administration created by President Gonzalez in 1982 disappeared, and some of its functions were re‐assigned to the First Deputy Prime Minister, Teresa Fernandez de la Vega. The newly created post of Third Deputy Prime Minister assumed the rest of its functions via the new Ministry of Territorial Affairs. This new post was occupied by a former Minister under Prime Minister González who had been the President of the Regional Government of Andalusia since 1990. The former Minister of Public Administration was moved to the Minister of Economics Affairs and Finance, as Second Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
         
         <p>The former Ministry of Education, Social Policy and Sport lost two main competences: Social Policy was reassigned to the former Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs, and Sport was reassigned to the Prime Minister. The new Minister of Education was a former dean of one of the Madrid's universities. The new Minister of Culture is a movie entrepreneur, and the new Minister of Health and Social Policy has occupied several political posts within the Zapatero Government. The previous Spokesman of the Socialist Group in Parliament, José Blanco was appointed to the post of Minister of Public Works. Those ministers who stepped down from government remained as members of the Chamber of Deputies (<i>Congreso de los Diputados</i>) in the short‐term, but a year later three of them had resigned and left political life.

         <p>In the first three quarters of 2009, the Spanish economy continued on the downward path begun in the second half of 2008. The decline affected all parts of the economy, especially manufacturing industry and construction, resulting in a rise in unemployment in the opening months of the year. As a result, the rate was higher than in previous recessions, reaching 18 per cent. Inflation predictably lessened, influenced, too, by the fall in the price of energy products, which had posted notable increases in 2008. General government activity continued to be markedly expansionary as a result of the effect of the aforementioned plans designed to support activity, of tax cuts and of other measures introduced in 2008 that continued in 2009.</p>
         
         <p>All this resulted in a drastic deterioration of public finances, which went from a deficit of 4.1 per cent of GDP in 2008 to 11.4 per cent in 2009. The announcement of the Stability Programme was accompanied by the ratification of the commitment to meet the budgetary stability target within the time horizons set by the European Union (EU) authorities so as to conform to the Stability and Growth Pact in the current exceptional circumstances. Essentially, this requires the budget deficit to be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP in 2013. To do this, the government has announced public spending cuts totalling €50 billion. Additionally, the cabinet tabled an austerity plan for 2011–2013, which proposes general spending cuts equal to 2.6 per cent of GDP for the period as a whole.</p>
         
         <p>The economic downturn gradually eased, notably in mid‐2009 when GDP posted a decline of only 0.3 per cent in real terms. Both exports and imports saw their annual rates of decline slow significantly. Job losses in the closing months of 2009 also lessened. Despite the relative improvement in financial conditions and in the international environment, household spending remained sluggish as people saved more and paid off debt, although there was a slight rise in its consumption component associated chiefly with the effects of the direct aid programme for car purchases (Plan 2000E).</p>
         
         <p>Structural reforms are, along with budgetary consolidation, the main instrument available to help the economy emerge from the crisis and restore growth and employment generation. The government responded to this need: in addition to its commitment to austerity to ensure that the stability of public finances is redressed, it outlined other reforms, announcing, for instance, a gradual increase in the retirement age at the end of the year as well as talking about labour market reform.</p>
         
         <p>Obviously the important economic crisis affected the political situation, creating a more adversarial atmosphere in which the governing Socialist Party found itself on occasion abandoned by parties that normally supported it. Meanwhile the impasse in the Constitutional Court over constitutional appeals regarding the Catalan Statute of Autonomy prevented the appointment of new members of the court – appointments that depend on the two main parties reaching agreement. In the end, they did manage to reach agreement on the General Council of Justice <i>(Consejo General del Poder Judicial</i>) and the President of the Council of Spanish Television (<i>Presidente del Consejo de Radiotelevision</i>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The government continued its policies against ETA terrorists, with the solid support of the police of France and Portugal.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Regional elections</h2>
         
         <p>During the year some regional elections were held. The regional president of Galicia, the Socialist Perez Touriño, and of the País Vasco (Basque Country), the nationalist Ibarreche, called elections to their regional parliaments for 1 March. This was going to be the first re‐election process for the Socialist President, but it was the fourth time for Ibarreche although his party list, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), stood without his former coalition associate, Eusko Alkartasuna. The turnout in both elections was 64.4 per cent: in Galicia this was the same as in previous elections, but in País Vasco it was a rise of four points. The results gave an absolute majority in Galicia to the Popular Party (PP) with 50.07 per cent of the seats: one more than in previous elections. The PP presented a new candidate, Nuñez Feijó, a regional civil servant who had occupied several posts in the national government with Prime Minister Aznar and who was also a former regional minister in Galicia (2003–2005) with President Fraga. Nuñez Feijó was elected in 2006 as president of the Galicia Popular Party, after Fraga, by then over 80, resigned as its president. The nationalist party, Bloque Nacionalista Gallego (BNG), lost a seat, partly because its leader was involved in several corruption scandals, but also because the economic crisis affected the government parties.</p>
         
         <p>The results in País Vasco were more complex because in this region no party had ever won an absolute majority in its nine elections. The PNV maintain its electoral support in terms of votes (38.56 per cent) and increased its parliamentary strength to 40 per cent, but it could not build its former coalition government because its former allies got only 2.66 per cent of the seats. In contrast, the Socialist Party, with its regionalist leader, J. López (Paxti López), deputy of the regional Basque parliament since 1999, increased its vote by eight percentage points, giving it 33.33 per cent of the seats. In this case, the Popular Party offered its parliamentary support (with 17.33 per cent of the seats) to enable an absolute majority for a socialist‐led government. The PP wanted to put an end to the nationalist hegemony since the first regional elections and its alleged ambiguity towards extremists. This agreement between the PSOE and the PP was indeed reached, partly because Rodriguez Zapatero had already decided to end the negotiations with ETA and partly because the PSOE wanted to became a party government in this region.</p>

         <p>The EP elections took place on Sunday, 7 June 2009, to choose Spain's 50 MEPs. The most repeated words in the media about the EP were ‘disaffection’, ‘demotivation’, ‘lack of information’ and ‘lack of a real debate about Europe’. ‘Mobilisation’ was the key word in the election campaign, to make people aware of the significance of the elections and to increase participation. Yet anyone hoping that people and interested parties would discuss transnational issues, such as economic crises, migration, climate change, security and the role of Europe in an increasingly interconnected world, would have to be disappointed: domestic affairs dominated the campaign, particularly rising unemployment and a peppering of political scandals. However, while many observers anticipated a plebiscite on PP leader Mariano Rajoy, his conservative opposition party being at the centre of corruption scandals and himself the target of internal criticism about his weak leadership, the election turned out to be something of an ordeal for the government fifteen months after winning a general election and securing a second term in office.</p>
         
         <p>The Popular Party gained 42 per cent of the total votes cast, winning 23 seats in the EP compared to the ruling Socialist Party's 38 per cent and 21 seats. This election result came as a relief to the leader of the opposition, who could celebrate his first national election success since taking over the PP leadership in 2004. However, the PP lead of half a million votes was below the five‐point margin that some observers warned would have a serious impact on Zapatero's authority to rule and could have led to the calling of early national elections. The ruling party took solace in the fact that it won the highestsupport of any socialist party in Europe and claimed the result was ‘reasonably positive’ under the circumstances.</p>
         
         <p>Smaller parties failed to make much of an impact against the main two parties, securing only six of the fifty seats allocated to Spain. One of those, the new Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD), confirmed its seat gained in the Spanish lower house in previous general elections. Turnout in Spain, although marginally down, was above the average across the EU, with some 45 per cent of registered voters going to the polls.</p>
