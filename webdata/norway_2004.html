         <p>The national election to the <i>Storting</i> on 12 September gave a majority to the new red‐green alliance consisting of Labour, the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party. They won 87 of the 169 seats. Labour became the biggest of the three parties with 61 mandates. The incumbent parties, the Conservatives, the Christian People's Party and the Liberals, only won 54 seats despite the Liberals’ major increase from two to ten seats. In the previous election in 2001, the Liberals did not manage to exceed the 4 per cent threshold, but with 5.9 per cent of the votes in 2005 they were abundantly rewarded with several of the new ‘adjustment’ seats (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2002</a></span>: 1050, <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2004</a></span>: 1102). The Progress Party increased their representation to 38 seats and became the largest opposition party in the parliament.
         </p>
         
         <p>The red‐green alliance had been leading in the opinion polls for a long time, but during the last week before the election the polls indicated that it would be a very close race. Several of the polls showed that a majority of the seats would be won by the bourgeois parties. As opposed to the previous national election campaign, the battle in 2005 was between two clearly defined government alternatives. Not surprisingly, this resulted in a small increase in turnout; 77. 4 per cent of the electorate participated in the 2005 election, which was an increase of 1.9 per cent since 2001.</p>
         
         <p>The media soon declared Labour and the Progress Party winners of the election. Both parties had a significant increase from the previous election, but they were declared winners for different reasons. For the Progress Party, this was their best election result ever; for Labour, it was their second worst election result since the Second World War. However, Labour managed to turn the negative tide – and they achieved their important goal of forming a majority government together with the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party. This was the first majority government since Willoch II (1983–1985) lost the election twenty years ago.</p>
         
         <p>There are several reasons to claim that the campaign leading up to the 2005 election started immediately after the previous election in 2001. Labour had experienced their worst results since 1924. The Centre Party was no longer in alliance with their previous friends in the Centre Alliance. The Socialist Left, on the other hand, experienced their best result ever, and their support continued to rise according to the opinion polls. Labour, which previously preferred to govern alone, began to consider the idea of a majority coalition government including the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party. Previous minority governments had all experienced what has been called ‘S<i>tortingsregjereri</i>’ or ‘governing parliaments’: changing parliamentary majorities dictated to the minority government on various important issues (see, e.g., <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2003</a></span>: 1050). Especially Labour leader Jens Stoltenberg stressed how minority governments were more problematic than majority coalitions.
         </p>
         
         <p>The other long‐term plan to secure a better result for Labour in the 2005 election was related to policy positions and links to the trade unions. Like many Social Democratic parties in Europe, Labour moved to the right during the late 1990s, and many members of Labour saw the bad election result in 2001 as a consequence of this. The argument was that their profile had become too ‘vague’ and that they therefore lost support among traditional voters without convincing new groups. For instance, Labour votes among trade union members dropped from 54 per cent in 1997 to 33 per cent in 2001 (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aardal 2003</a></span>: 267). Many party members argued that Labour had to re‐strengthen their ties with the Confederation of Trade Unions (LO). At Labour's national congress in April 2005, this ‘reunion’ was clearly demonstrated and the party manifesto for 2005–2009 is commonly presented in public debate as a rapprochement to the trade unions’ policy views on welfare and economic issues (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Allern forthcoming</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>LO also strengthened their link with the Socialist Left Party during the early 2000s. In 2003, the LO leadership attended SV's national congress for the first time in history and in 2005, SV's party leader gave a speech to the LO congress on an equal footing with the Labour Party. However, for the Socialist Left Party the new link to the trade unions did not secure a good election result. The party was declared one of the main losers, partly because of a 3.7 per cent decline from the 2001 election, but more importantly because of the significant loss they experienced during the election campaign. In the previous national election campaign, the party received a lot of praise for their campaign strategy (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Jenssen 2006</a></span>: 7). In 2005, the party was up against tougher opposition. The Conservatives made SV their main target and a lot of the media coverage seemed negative. An initiative from party leader Kristin Halvorsen during a broadcast question‐and‐answer session did not have the positive effect they probably hoped for. In order to stress the party's commitment on child day care, Halvorsen claimed that she would resign if the party in government did not succeed in implementing the so‐called ‘day care agreement’ from 2002 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2003</a></span>: 1050). However, SV would not indicate a deadline as to when they should have accomplished this; nor did they know how much demand for day care would increase because of the price reduction.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another problem for SV was the focus on their education policy, and their suggestion not to give grades to pupils. Reports from OECD's PISA study (<span title=""><a href="#b9" id="#b9R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">OECD 2004</a></span>) demonstrated that Norway did not do well in international rankings,<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> and as in previous election campaigns education became one of the most important issues both for the electorate and the media (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Jenssen 2006</a></span>: 10). Education is an issue where SV has established strong issue ownership (together with the Conservatives), but the party did not seem prepared for all the attacks made by the Conservatives. In one of the major television debates about education, the Conservative Minister of Education claimed that SV were not concerned about teaching quality and how to make Norwegian pupils better. SV did not manage to defend the party policy, possibly because the television station had insisted that Inga Marthe Torkildsen, and not the party spokesperson for education, represent the Socialist Left. The focus on grades also illustrated the difference between SV and the other two parties in the red‐green alliance, and former Labour Minister of Education Trond Giske stressed in the same debate how a new red‐green government would keep grades. Finally, foreign policy was also a problematic issue for the Socialist Left in 2005. This was another area where views within the red‐green alliance differed significantly. For instance, SV wanted full withdrawal of Norwegian military personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq – and generally a more America‐critical foreign policy than the other two parties wanted.
         </p>
         
         <p>The third party in the new red‐green alliance, the Centre Party, increased its vote somewhat and gained one new seat. After the Centre Alliance's defeat in 2001, the Centre Party's opposition to Bondevik II soon became evident. On several issues like the merging of municipalities, the economy of the municipalities, the new private school act and business policy, the Centre Party and Bondevik II disagreed. The World Trade Organisation negotiations intensified the differences between the Centre Party and Bondevik II further. The Centre Party accused their previous coalition partners of letting the Conservatives dominate, while the Conservatives used every opportunity to describe the Centre Party as leftist. The Centre Party realised that it was time for a political reorientation as their attempts to stimulate conflict between the Conservatives and the two other parties were unsuccessful. Nor did they want another four years with a centre‐right coalition backed up by the Progress Party. Although both the Centre Party and Socialist Left on several occasions voluntarily helped form a minority Labour Government (1935, 1961, 1971, 1990, 1993), the situation in 2005 was new for all three parties. For Labour this was their first coalition experience; for the Socialist Left Party it was their first time in government. The Centre Party had both government and coalition experience, but this was the first time they were part of an alliance together with social democratic parties. During the election campaign, the incumbent parties – the Conservatives, the Christian People's Party and the Liberals – used this new situation to warn against what they saw as a risky political experiment.</p>
         
         <p>The challenge for the governing parties in 2005 was extensive. In addition to the government's declining support, the polls showed a majority in favour of the red‐green alliance, and the Progress Party got more support than any of the incumbent parties. The battle had to be won on two fronts: regain a majority and weaken the Progress Party without provoking them too much, as a new centre‐right government would need at least passive support from the Progress Party.<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence, the government's strategy was two‐sided.
         </p>
         
         <p>To compete with – but not upset – the Progress Party, the Conservatives stressed further tax‐reductions and Norway's economic success. On the other side, the government described the red‐green alliance as a threat to the good economic results they have achieved. As a rhetorical tool, they consequently called the new alliance ‘the socialists’ or ‘the red danger’. Most of the criticism was directed towards the Socialist Left Party, but their rhetoric was also designed to scare many of the more conservative supporters of the Centre Party. Their strategy was not very successful. Although the attacks against the Socialist Left Party had some effect, they did not manage to promote their own party platform. And both the Conservatives and the Christian People's Party experienced a considerable loss. With, respectively, 14.1 and 6.8 per cent of the votes, it was their worst result since the Second World War. For both parties, the decline started soon after the parliamentary election in 2001.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberals were the only incumbent party to gain support. They had their best election result since 1969, and the increase of two percentage points up to 5.9 per cent brought them comfortably above the 4 per cent threshold. Interestingly, this increase happened in the last two weeks before election day. In the first weeks of the campaign, the polls indicated that they would achieve around 3 per cent of the votes.<a href="#en3" class="scrollableLink"><sup>3</sup></a> During the campaign, the Liberals stressed how a new centre‐right government would depend on the Liberals achieving several of the ‘adjustment seats’. Moreover, tactical voting came up as an issue and was frequently discussed in the media during the campaign. These factors are probably what caused the rapid increase in support for the Liberals.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, the Progress Party had every reason to be happy with their election result. With an increase from 14.6 to 22.1 per cent, they became the second largest party in the parliament. However, their ultimate dream was to be part of a new bourgeois government. The Progress Party saw two potential obstacles that would threaten this dream. For the first time in many years, the election campaign would focus on two clearly defined government alternatives. The Progress Party was not included in either of them and found during the spring of 2005 that attention was primarily directed towards the other parties. Another problem was related to what party leader Carl I. Hagen described as the biggest threat to a new bourgeois government. Although the Progress Party on several occasions had shown willingness to cooperate with the centre‐right government, Prime Minister Bondevik turned down all overtures to establish formal cooperation with the Progress Party. He argued that the political distance between the Progress Party and the incumbent parties was too big. This dispute between Bondevik and the Progress Party made Hagen declare that his party would, under no circumstances, support a new government under Bondevik's leadership. As a result, a lot of attention was again directed towards the Progress Party. Although the Conservatives and the Liberals loyally backed up their prime minister, many centre‐right voters had sympathy for Mr. Hagen's frustration – and gave their vote to the Progress Party instead.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>As in 2004, pensions became an important issue in 2005. Although most parties agreed that a new pension system was needed, there were political disagreement about how the new system should work (see <span title=""><a href="#b30" id="#b30R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2005</a></span>: 1143–1144). In 2005 the debate continued and one of the central concerns was related to how this new reform would affect certain groups (the highly educated, women, etc.) who for various reasons had periods without employment. However, on 19 May, a settlement was made between the Conservatives, the Christian People's Party, the Liberals, Labour and the Centre Party. It seemed that all parties were eager to prevent the issue from becoming central in the upcoming election campaign. For the centre‐right government, reducing welfare benefits would not be an issue that would gain new votes. For Labour, who can be said to own the issue, the compromise was close enough to their policy preference that they did not want to risk leaving the decision until after the election, partly because Labour and their prospective government partner the Socialist Left Party disagreed, but also because the Progress Party, which opposed the pension settlement, was expected to do well in the upcoming election.
         </p>
         
         <p>One of the other central issues in 2005 was also related to the election – although the parties involved also managed to some extent to exclude it from the election campaign. In November 2004, an official committee presented their report on how to finance political parties and organisations, and suggested potential changes to a new law regulating the disclosure of the income of political parties (<span title=""><a href="#b8" id="#b8R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">NOU 2004</a></span>: 25). This was debated during the spring of 2005. The new law was proposed by Minister of Modernisation Morten Andreas Mayer and passed by the parliament in June 2005. The new law stated that political parties are required to list all income in a public register, and that all monetary gifts exceeding 30,000 kroner (on a national level) must be registered with the name of the contributor. The debate culminated when the organisation of trade unions (LO) announced that Labour would be given 2,750,000 kroner for their election campaign, while the Socialist Left Party would receive 750,000. The incumbent parties as well as the Progress Party argued that the trade unions were buying political power. However, all parties agreed that the parties should be free to accept gifts from organisations and private actors. Moreover, several of the bourgeois parties received support from rich business actors as well as the ship‐owners association.
         </p>
         
         <p>For the first time in many years, Norway's foreign policy became an important issue during an election year. The Socialist People's Party, the predecessor to the Socialist Left Party, was established in 1961 by a breakaway faction of Labour who opposed Labour's view on nuclear weapons and Norway's membership in NATO. In 2005, the NATO issue was brought up by other parties as one of many where the red‐green alliance disagreed. SV assured that they would not try to terminate Norway's membership in NATO – but the focus on SV's divergent foreign policy remained. A content analysis of the Norwegian newspapers during the election campaign showed that foreign policy ranked as the fifth most important issue (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Høidahl 2005</a></span>: 8). Moreover, foreign policy became a problematic issue for SV even after the election. The party wanted to induce a boycott of Israeli products, and party leader and Minister of Finance Kristin Halvorsen supported the party position. However, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre from Labour forced Ms Halvorsen to make it clear that this was not the Government's position, and that SV as a coalition partner opposed such a boycott.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another issue where the Socialist Left Party was in strong disagreement with Labour was related to the environment and whether to allow offshore oil drilling outside the northern parts of Norway. The Socialist Left Party stressed the environmental dangers of drilling in this area. For Labour, this was equally a question of employment and economic development for the region. The price of oil was also an issue in 2005, and Hurricane Katrina, which hit the southeast coast of the United States in August, made it a current issue in the last part of the election campaign. The price of petrol has always been an important issue for the Progress Party, which was the only party that benefited from this debate.</p>
         
         <p>A final issue worth mentioning was the economic problems facing the Ministry of Defence. The office of the Auditor General delivered a very critical report on the ministry's accounts for 2004. They had used more than 1.15 billion kroner over what the parliament had allowed. Moreover, their accounts for 2003 had also been rejected, and the Minister of Defence Kristin Krohn Devold was criticised for poor financial management. The Progress Party proposed a motion of no confidence towards the Minister of Defence, but the other opposition parties did not want to support this motion due to the upcoming election.</p>
