         <p>The political year of 2011 may not have been as momentous as 2010, but it can hardly be described as uninteresting. The four‐party centre‐right Alliance government remained in office throughout 2011 without being seriously threatened, and with very limited personal changes, but it was reminded on several occasions of the fact that it was now a minority government. Meanwhile the once‐dominant Social Democratic Party went through a difficult leadership change process, and was in deep crisis by the end of the year. Another two parliamentary parties changed leaders, and in two further parties leadership contests were due in early 2012. Economically, Sweden had escaped relatively unharmed from the 2008–2009 recession, but 2011 was a year of economic uncertainty, with clouds emerging on the horizon towards the end of the year.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy33-sec-0003"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy33-sec-0003-title"> Cabinet report and issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The only changes in the cabinet during 2011 were caused by a leadership change in the Centre Party. On 17 June, Maud Olofsson announced that she would step down as leader of the Centre Party. She had led the party for ten years, served as Minister for Enterprise from 2006 and been Deputy Prime Minister between 2006 and 2010. The resignation appears to have been her own decision, and primarily based on a feeling that she had taken the party as far as she could. After a leadership contest involving three candidates, who embarked on a series of debates across the country, the Centre Party selection committee announced on 31 August that it would recommend the 28 year‐old Annie Lööf as new leader. The other contenders then withdrew, and Lööf was elected new leader without opposition at an extraordinary Centre Party congress on 24 September. Lööf, who has cited Margaret Thatcher as a political role model, vowed to continue a renewal process started under Olofsson, where the Centre Party has gradually de‐emphasised its traditional roots among farmers and the rural population, and moved closer to an ideological position where individualism and economic liberalism are key elements. Lööf, whose surname had been Johansson until she married in the summer of 2011, had been a Member of Parliament since 2006, but had no previous government experience.</p>
         
         <p>As leader of one of the government coalition parties, Lööf was automatically given a place in the cabinet. Constitutionally, it is the Prime Minister who appoints and dismisses members of the government, but in coalitions there is a convention that the respective parties select their own ministers. Consequently, Lööf could reshuffle the four‐strong Centre Party team in the Alliance government – an opportunity she used. Maud Olofsson declared that she was prepared to continue in government but was effectively sacked by Lööf, who took Olofsson's place as Minister for Enterprise. Lööf also dismissed the Minister for the Environment, Andreas Carlgren, and appointed the EU parliamentarian Lena Ek in his place. Ek has a university degree in law, and was a member of the Swedish parliament 1998–2004. Anna‐Karin Hatt, one of Lööf's competitors for the leadership, stayed in the cabinet but had her portfolio extended to include energy issues, which had previously been handled by Olofsson. The fourth Centre Party member of the government, Eskil Erlandsson, stayed as Minister for Agriculture. The changes meant that the proportion of women in the cabinet was increased to exactly 50 per cent, while the average age went down marginally.</p>
         
         <p>Lööf took over a party in crisis. It had lost votes and seats in the 2010 election, and had been below the 4 per cent representational threshold in a number of opinion polls since the election. The poll ratings improved somewhat after the leadership change, but there was no major ‘Lööf effect’. There were problems also among the other junior members of the Alliance coalition. The dominant position of the Moderate Party, which overtook the Social Democrats as the country's biggest party in several polls in 2011, made it difficult for the other three coalition parties to build their own public profile. The problem was particularly serious for the Christian Democrats, which was below 4 per cent in a majority of the polls taken in 2011. In October, the former Minister for Local Government and Financial Markets, Mats Odell, challenged Göran Hägglund to the leadership. The contest was to be decided at a party congress scheduled for January 2012.</p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party was going through a serious crisis. It had suffered an historic defeat for a second consecutive election in 2010 and the party leader since 2007, Mona Sahlin, was forced to resign (Widfeldt <span title=""><a href="#epdy33-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy33-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). The leadership selection process that followed was essentially kept behind closed doors. An internal party selection committee was due to present a new leader in time for an extraordinary party congress scheduled for late March. The process proved very difficult in a party affected by internal tensions and a sense of profound crisis caused by the steep decline in popular support. A large number of possible candidates appeared in media speculations, but it came as a total surprise to almost everyone when, on 10 March, the selection committee proposed the 49 year‐old Håkan Juholt as new leader. Juholt, who was regarded as positioned to the left of centre in the party, had been an MP since 1994, but never held a post in government and was virtually unknown to the general public. He was unanimously confirmed as the new leader by the extraordinary party congress on 25 March. His inaugural speech aroused much enthusiasm among the delegates, and he quickly built a reputation as an inspirational speaker and a good debater.
         </p>
         
         <p>For a few months the situation looked positive for Juholt. He was criticised for a number of ill‐judged statements and factual errors, but his somewhat unorthodox political style, which could be described as a combination of passion and humour, seemed to go down well with the public. His party's poll ratings improved. In early October, however, media reports started to appear about expense irregularities. As a MP resident outside Stockholm, Juholt was entitled to full compensation for the rent of a flat in the capital. When, however, his partner had moved into the property, he was only entitled to compensation for his share of the rent, but continued to claim expenses for the full rent. When the story broke, Juholt immediately rectified his error and repaid the surplus expenses received (reportedly SEK 160,000 (approximately €16,000); figures taken from Thulin <span title=""><a href="#epdy33-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy33-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). It was suggested that the expense regulations were not unambiguous, and Juholt denied any intentional wrongdoing. A police investigation for fraud was launched, but quickly dropped. Still, the affair caused major damage. Juholt's personal poll ratings, as well as those for his party, took a serious dive. The expense affair was Juholt's most serious problem, but he was also criticised for failing to build an effective organisation around him. Critics also argued that Juholt was somewhat unstructured, sometimes appearing to lack command of detail. A crisis meeting of the party executive committee in mid‐October resulted in an expression of continued confidence in Juholt, but his authority was undermined, and both his and his party's poll ratings continued to slide towards the end of the year.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Green Party also changed leadership in 2011. The Greens have kept a dual leadership model with one ‘spokesperson’ from each gender, and have also maintained a mandatory rotation principle. The latter meant that the highly successful duo of Maria Wetterstrand and Peter Eriksson, appointed in 2002, was forced to step down after nine years at the helm. Several candidates announced interest in the two vacant posts, and there was a fairly lively campaign, but without serious conflict. At the party conference in June, Gustav Fridolin and Asa Romson were appointed as male and female spokespersons, respectively.</p>
         
         <p>Left Party leader Lars Ohly was under pressure after a disappointing election result in 2010. After initially appearing to wish to fight on, Ohly announced his resignation in August. A leadership selection process ensued, which was set to be decided at a party congress scheduled for January 2012.</p>
         
         <p>The position of the government was never seriously threatened during 2011, but it was repeatedly reminded of the fact that it no longer commanded a parliamentary majority. The pivotal position of the Sweden Democrats added an element of unpredictability to the situation. No other party would cooperate with the Sweden Democrats, but a defeat for the government could occur every time the Sweden Democrats decided to vote with the other opposition parties. The risk of such defeats was somewhat reduced when a policy agreement on migration issues was struck between the government and the Greens in early March, thus effectively denying the Sweden Democrats any influence on their profile issue. In addition, the framework regulating the budget process meant that there was no serious threat against the government's overall economic policy. This still left the government open to possible defeats on a large number of issues. The most notable example in 2011 came on 1 July, when the four opposition parties enforced changes in the sickness benefit system, whose rules had been tightened by the government during the 2006–2010 parliament. The changes were quite technical, and their practical significance limited, but they had symbolic significance and highlighted the instability of the majority situation. A reduction in income tax envisaged by the government also seemed in danger of being defeated, but the government was ‘rescued’ by the uncertain economic situation, which provided a legitimate reason not to go ahead with a formal proposal.</p>
         
         <p>Economically, the year 2011 was not as buoyant as 2010. Over the whole year the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate went down from 5.5 per cent in 2010 to 3.9 per cent in 2011, according to a report published in March 2011 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER). In fact the growth rate was negative (−1.1 per cent) in the last three months of the year. The NIER projected a further slowdown of the growth rate to 0.4 per cent in 2012, but a recovery to 2.5 per cent in 2013. The central bank (Riksbanken) changed the Repo interest rate four times. At the beginning of 2011 it was 1.50 per cent, in July it was raised to 2.00 per cent, but in December it was lowered to 1.75 per cent. The fiscal situation was stable, with a surplus of SEK68 billion (approximately €6.8 billion) for 2011, compared to a SEK1.1 billion (approximately €0.1 billion) surplus the previous year, according to the National Debt Office. Figures from the same organisation showed that the national debt had sunk to SEK1.108 billion (€111 billion) by the end of 2011 – a reduction of SEK44 billion compared to twelve months earlier. Relative to GDP, the national debt sank from 35 to 29 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The situation on the labour market was a cause for continued concern. The overall rate of unemployment sank to 6.2 per cent (3.4 per cent in open unemployment and 2.8 per cent in labour market schemes) – a decline of 0.7 percentage points compared to 2010. The number of redundancies, however, rose from 44,000 to 46,000, and the rate of unemployment was projected to rise in 2012 and 2013 (figures and projections from the Swedish Public Employment Service). Much attention was paid to the crisis at car maker SAAB which, after many twists and turns, filed for bankruptcy on 19 December. Around 3,500 employees were directly affected.</p>
         
         <p>According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12‐month changes in Consumer Price Index) was 2.5 per cent at the beginning of 2011, but then rose to above 3 per cent between April and September, peaking at 3.4 per cent in August. It then sank, to within Riksbanken's target rate of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point, reaching an annual low of 2.3 per cent in December.</p>
