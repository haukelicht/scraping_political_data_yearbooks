         <p>The Vice Chancellor and Minister of Finance as well as leader of the People's Party, Josef Pröll, announced his complete withdrawal from politics on health grounds in April. Pröll had been in office since 2008 (Fallend <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2009</a></span>: 895–897). His retreat resulted in a major cabinet reshuffle on 21 April that was restricted to his party's government team. The government team of the Social Democratic Party, partner in a grand coalition, remained unchanged. Pröll was replaced as Vice Chancellor and party leader (in May) by Michael Spindelegger, who continued to serve as Minister of for European and International Affairs. The Ministry of Finance was handed to Maria Fekter, previously Minister of the Interior. Her portfolio was given to Johanna Mikl‐Leitner, previously member of the Land government of Lower Austria. A luckless Minister of Justice, Claudia Bandion‐Ortner, resigned and was replaced by Beatrix Karl, previously Minister for Science and Research. Karlheinz Töchterle, a former university rector, was made Minister for Science and Research.
         </p>
         
         <p>The party's two secretaries of state also stepped down. Secretaries of State are not cabinet members. They had been assigned to the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Affairs, Family and Youth and were replaced by two new secretaries of state assigned to the Ministry for European and International Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior. The latter post was designated as a State Secretary for Integration and given to a 24 year‐old party talent who initiated steps to soften the party's hard‐line image in that policy area.</p>
         
         <p>Neither Federal Chancellor Faymann nor the new Vice‐Chancellor Spindelegger was able to shed their public perception as administrators rather than bold political leaders. Federal Chancellor Faymann enjoyed friendly coverage in the tabloid papers (see<b> Issues in national politics</b>, below), but efforts to stake out a stronger position on the Internet and new social media platforms turned into an embarrassing public relations disaster. It also exposed dubious practices employed by the Social Democratic Party, which was apparently irked by the social media success of the leader of the oppositional Freedom Party, Heinz‐Christian Strache, who had more than 100,000 friends on Facebook. The Federal Chancellor's widely announced ‘social media offensive’, coordinated by ministerial employees, started on Austrian National Day in October. The communication campaign was ridiculed from the start. In a turn for the worse, a news magazine exposed the sudden increase in the number of Facebook friends as manipulation based on fictitious profiles. Friendly comments of apparent young fans were traced back to computers located at the Social Democratic Party offices. Further media inquests revealed fictitious authorships of admiring letters to the editor printed in tabloid papers.

         <p>The federal government adopted a ‘historic’ reform of the system of administrative courts at the end of 2011. About 120 appellate senates and special agencies will be replaced by nine regional and two federal administrative courts. The reform, which will come into effect in 2014, was passed by parliament as a constitutional law in May 2012.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy2-sec-0004"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy2-sec-0004-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>No national or regional elections took place in 2011. The complex European currency, state debt and banking crises naturally remained on the national agenda throughout the year. Austria's economic indicators are still among the European Union's best and the government supported the Germany Chancellor's emphasis on austerity policy as a solution to these crises. In an interview in June, federal Chancellor Werner Faymann declared himself a ‘committed European’ who believed in finding solutions at the European level. It was a remarkable move away from the euroscepticism that he had embraced ahead of the last national election in 2008 (Fallend <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2009</a></span>: 884).
         </p>
         
         <p>Fearing a downgrading of the country's credit rating, a ‘debt brake’ was passed by the government parties as part of the budget law in December. Following the German example, the plan aims to decrease public debt to 60 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020 and the structural deficit to 0.35 per cent of GDP by 2017. The government's initial goal to elevate the ‘debt brake’ to constitutional rank could not be realised. Opposition parties denied a two‐third's majority support in parliament after the government parties did not agree to their demands. The Greens had wanted introduction of a wealth tax, and the Alliance for the Future of Austria an inclusion of sanction mechanisms.</p>
         
         <p>News headlines during the year often dealt with corruption and misuse of public monies for partisan and personal goals. The delegation leader of the People's Party in the European Parliament, Ernst Strasser, a former Minister of the Interior, stepped down in March after featuring prominently on video in the ‘Cash for Laws’ scandal exposed by the British newspaper <i>The Sunday Times</i>. In April, Austrian MEP Hans‐Peter Martin was accused of misusing the state refunding of campaign expenditures for personal gains. Martin had gained publicity as a crusader against corruption in the past. In October, a parliamentary Committee of Enquiry for the Clarification of Allegations of Corruption was set up by unanimous vote. The Committee of Enquiry was tasked to look into seven different affairs. Due to judicial inquiries running in parallel, thorny legal questions surfaced again with regard to the rights of persons summoned before the Committee. Repeating past practice, a special legal counsel was appointed to safeguard them during hearings. The Committee was chaired by a Green MP. (The Greens was the only one of the five parliamentary parties not implicated in any of these affairs.)
         </p>
         
         <p>Several of the investigations dealt with alleged illegal activities in the period 2000–2006, during the coalition government of People's Party and Freedom Party and, after the later split (Fallend <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2006</a></span>: 1043–1047), the coalition of People's Party and Alliance for the Future of Austria. Allegations included insider deals and illegal payments to politicians in privatisation and public procurement projects. The public learned astonishing details from summoned lobbyists about the range of their networks, their means (e.g., invitations for hunting trips) and their influence on legislation and regulatory decisions. Former ministers – most prominently ex‐Minister of Finance Karl‐Heinz Grasser – had to appear before the Committee. The opposition plans to question acting Federal Chancellor Faymann on expensive advertising campaigns in tabloid papers paid by public companies and agencies controlled by the Ministry of Transport during his stewardship of the Ministry from 2006 to 2008. The Committee of Enquiry is expected to finish its hearings by the end of 2012.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the start of the year on 24 January, Social Democratic Minister of Defence Norbert Darabos recalled the country's army chief of staff, citing a loss of confidence in him. The country's top officer, a member of the same party, had criticised in an interview the Minister's stated goal of abolishing compulsory military service and replacing it with a smaller professional army. The position of the army chief of staff was supported by a large part of the officer's corps as well as by the People's Party. The coalition parties had executed a surprising switch of policy positions during the previous year, with the most remarkable <i>volte‐face</i> executed by the Minister of Defence himself. In July 2010 he expressed support for maintaining conscription, but ahead of the Land elections in Vienna in October of that year he suddenly embraced the idea of a professional army. The Social Democratic Party had become increasingly worried about waning support among young voters and a loss of its absolute majority in Vienna (Jenny <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 908–910). The Minister's U‐turn put an end to an historic party stance on defence policy. The People's Party had viewed the idea of a professional army favourably in the past, but had second thoughts now and switched position as well. The party pointed out there would be no conscripts available anymore to support the civil authorities' cleanup efforts after regional natural disasters. Abolition of conscription would also end the alternative civilian service upon which many social organisations rely as a workforce.
         </p>
         
         <p>The unprecedented recall of the army chief of staff encountered a wave of criticism, including from President Heinz Fischer, formally the supreme commander of the armed forces. The demoted officer immediately filed a protest against the ministerial order which he finally received after half a year of delay. An independent board of review nullified the order and the army chief of staff was reinstated in office in November. At the end of the year, the army's assistance mission in Burgenland ended without a fuss after 21 years. Army conscripts had assisted the police in guarding the country's eastern border against illegal immigration. Further extension of the mission had been a prominent issue in the Land election of the previous year (Jenny <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 905–907).
         </p>
         
         <p>The government parties continued to disagree on matters of education policy. The Social Democratic Party, which held the portfolio, pushed nationwide introduction of a common school for pupils aged 10–14. The People's Party wanted to preserve the current education system with different types of schools. Critics see the differentiated school system as a hindrance to social mobility. A people's initiative on education policy, headed by prominent industrialist and former Social Democratic Minister of Finance Hannes Androsch and backed by an alliance of leftist organistions as well as business circles, tried to rally political support for education policy reform. However, they largely failed to mobilise the electorate during the inscription period in November. The people's initiative collected 383,724 signatures, which amounts to a participation rate of 6.1 per cent of the electorate and is about the median of 35 people's initiatives conducted since 1945. In spring, only 1.6 per cent of the electorate participated in another people's initiative which wanted Austria to pull out of the EURATOM treaty. Its participation rate was the second lowest ever. The record for a people's initiative stands at 25.7 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>An intra‐party dispute over a symbolic issue turned into a noteworthy parliamentary episode in July. A prominent MP from the People's Party tried to drum up support for modernising the national anthem in the name of gender equality. Maria Rauch‐Kallat had been a minister in several past governments, also serving as a Minister for Women, and was poised to end her parliamentary career. Backed by female party colleagues, Rauch‐Kallat wanted to include the word ‘daughters’ in the anthem's verse ‘You are home to great sons’. Male party colleagues found the issue unworthy of their time, along with a large part of the public, and denied majority support for the proposal, while female MPs from the Social Democrats and Greens signalled their support. Rauch‐Kallat intended introducing a private member's bill, signed by female MPs from all three parties, during her parliamentary farewell speech. The introduction of an unconsented private member's bill constitutes a clear breach of party regulations. Fuming male party colleagues, who had learned of her plans, reacted by exceeding their speaking time limits until the party's plenary time had ran out and Rauch‐Kallat was unable to hold her farewell speech. The treatment was not well received by domestic public opinion and attracted international media attention as well. Within days, the People's Party turned around and came out in favour of amending the national anthem. The bill passed in October. The Alliance for the Future of Austria also voted in favour, while the Freedom Party remained opposed. The new anthem line is: ‘Home to great daughters and sons.’ A reference to ‘fraternal choirs’ in the lyrics was replaced by ‘jubilant choirs’.</p>
         
         <p>An old regional conflict was finally resolved in 2011 (Fallend <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2007</a></span>: 889–890; <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>: 915; <span title=""><a href="#epdy2-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy2-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2009</a></span>: 893). The State Treaty of 1955 which re‐established the country's sovereignty after the war accorded a number of rights to the Slovenian‐speaking minority in Carinthia. Among them were bilingual local signs in areas where a certain share of minority population lived. However, these bilingual signs were fiercely fought by German nationalist opponents. In 1972 new bilingual local signs were destroyed in the ‘<i>Ortstafelsturm</i>’ and the Land governor eventually had to resign. After that, Land governments stalled on the issue while minority organisations kept on pressing. Tensions at the societal level had eased considerably during the last decade, but several attempts to negotiate a political solution still fell apart because the political actors involved bailed out due to fear of negative reactions from voters or activists. The position of ex‐Land governor Jörg Haider (in office from 1989 to 1991 and from 1999 to 2008) oscillated between conciliatory steps and confrontation. Haider ignored several Constitutional Court rulings on the number, locations and format of bilingual local signs – a constant embarrassment to the federal government from a rule of law perspective. His successor from the same party, current Land governor Gerhard Dörfler, Federal State Secretary Josef Ostermayer representing the federal government, and the three organisations representing the Slovenian‐speaking minority finally concluded a deal in April. It stipulates bilingual local signs for164 localities belonging to 24 municipalities. Participation in a consultative referendum called by the Carinthian Land government was moderate (33 per cent), but consent was high (68 per cent). In July, the national parliament passed a constitutional law that codified the bargain.
