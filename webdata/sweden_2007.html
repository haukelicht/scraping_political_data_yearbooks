         <p>Although the international economic crisis increasingly made its presence felt, the year 2008 was comparatively quiet in Swedish politics. Unlike 2006 and 2007, there were no personal or organisational changes in the four‐party centre‐right ‘Alliance’ Government, and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and his team appeared more settled in 2008 than in previous years.</p>
         
         <p>The one issue that provided a temporary problem was bugging and surveillance. In 2007, the opposition had enforced a delay to a government proposal, authorising the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) to extend its monitoring of telecommunications traffic (laws deemed to restrict human rights and liberties can be delayed for one year by a one‐sixth minority). The bill was returned to parliament in June 2008. The proposal meant that all telephone calls, as well as text, fax and email messages, passing in and out of Sweden would be subject to possible monitoring by FRA. The proposal led to an intense debate, with the Internet‐based ‘Stop the FRA law’ campaign playing a vital part. A number of Members of Parliament for the Government parties indicated misgivings about the law, and it seemed possible that the bill would be defeated. After intense pressure on potential dissenters, and a number of late modifications, the bill was approved by a narrow majority. The debate nevertheless continued over the summer, and it seemed possible that the decision made in June would be revoked. In September, however, the debate subsided after the Government proposed further modifications, including the creation of a new authority, which will oversee surveillance and monitoring. The law will take effect on 1 October 2009.</p>
         
         <p>Other potentially difficult issues for the Government included same‐sex marriages and defence. In the former case, there was a clear parliamentary majority in favour of a law that would make same‐sex marriages possible. The problem was the Christian Democrats, whose opposition to such a law could have threatened government stability. In the end, a technical solution was chosen, which meant that the bill did not deal with gender‐related marriage issues, and that such matters would be brought into the eventual law via parliamentary motions rather than in the bill. This made it possible for the Christian Democrats to oppose same‐sex marriages in Parliament, without dissenting from the Government bill. The eventual decision was planned for 2009.</p>
         
         <p>The Swedish armed forces had been downsized for a number of years, and the development was expected to be further manifested in a Government bill scheduled for December 2008. The Russian‐Georgian conflict in August, however, led to a reassessment of the security situation, and the defence bill was delayed into 2009.</p>
         
         <p>The Swedish parliament ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in a single parliamentary vote, without a referendum, on 20 November 2008. The Treaty was approved with a clear majority. The Green and Left Parties voted against, while a small number of members from other parties abstained. The future of the Treaty, however, was uncertain due to its rejection in an Irish referendum earlier in the year.</p>
         
         <p>The economic recession became increasingly apparent in the second half of 2008. In the main budget, presented to Parliament in September, the Government still tried to maintain an air of optimism, claiming that Sweden was in better shape than most other comparable countries to meet the recession. In December, however, the Government found it necessary to present a crisis package. Between 2009 and 2011, a total of SEK23 billion (approx. €2.2 billion) would be invested in areas such as infrastructure, housing and adult education. The Opposition argued that this was not enough, and that the Government could do more to support regions hit by the crisis, but the public did not seem to fully agree. The Opposition had been ahead in the opinion polls since almost immediately after the 2006 election, and remained in the lead throughout 2008, but towards the end of the year the gap began to narrow. One possible reason was that the Government response to the economic crisis was seen as measured and competent. At least as important, however, was the lack of cohesion among the opposition parties.</p>
         
         <p>Since their election defeat in 2006, the Social Democratic‐Green‐Left bloc has been faced with the task of presenting the voters with a coherent and credible alternative in time for the 2010 election, but this has proved difficult. The Left Party was unwilling to accept the expenditure limit in the budget process, which the Social Democrats and the Greens see as an important part of a responsible fiscal policy. The Left Party also disagreed about the need for a joint pre‐election policy platform. Negotiations between the three parties were difficult, and in October the Social Democrats and the Greens announced plans for close and long‐term cooperation. Disagreement about the fiscal expenditure limit was cited as the main reason for excluding the Left Party. To no small extent the problem seemed to be the rather frosty relations between the Left and Green parties (which did not improve when the latter dropped its demand for Swedish exit from the European Union, following a membership referendum, the result of which was announced in early October). However, internal criticism against the ostracising of the Left Party forced the Social Democrats to backtrack. Negotiations were resumed and after the Left Party, somewhat grudgingly, had agreed to tolerate the budget process framework, the three opposition parties announced on 7 December that they intend to form a three‐party coalition after the 2010 election. This was probably a necessary part of the preparations for the election, but the preceding process was damaging for the credibility of the opposition bloc.</p>
         
         <p>In the first half of 2008 the sales were completed of two state‐owned companies – the alcohol producer Vin &amp; Sprit (bought by French company Pernod Ricard) and the property company Vasakronan. State‐owned shares in OMX (which runs the stock exchange in six Scandinavian and Baltic cities) were also sold off. At the end of the year, however, the Government conceded that the hardening economy made it unrealistic to complete its target of selling off its shares in six partly or wholly state‐owned companies by 2010. Nevertheless, the sales completed in 2008 contributed to an all‐time high fiscal surplus of SEK135 billion (approx. €14 billion), an increase of SEK32 billion compared to 2007, according to figures published by the National Debt Office (NDO) in February 2009. For 2009 and 2010, however, NDO projected fiscal deficits. The national debt shrank by SEK4.9 billion, to SEK1.119 billion (€20 billion), and declined relative to GDP from 38.1 per cent in 2007 to 35.4 per cent in 2008, but was expected to start growing in the coming years. The growth rate of calendar adjusted GDP went down from 2.7 per cent in 2007 to negative figures in 2008 (–0.5 per cent), according to a report published in March 2009 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER).</p>
         
         <p>The recession made its presence felt in the labour market. A total of 96,000 redundancies were announced during the year, the flagship car producer Volvo being among those most seriously affected. The annual average rate of unemployment went down marginally, to 3.2 per cent of the adult population. Another 1.5 per cent were in involved in labour market schemes, which meant a total unemployment rate of 4.7 per cent – a decline of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2007 (figures from the Swedish Public Employment Service; the classification of labour market schemes changed in 2007, which makes comparisons with earlier years difficult). Many of the redundancies would not take effect until 2009, however, and there was deep concern for the development of the labour market in the next few years. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12‐month changes in Consumer Price Index) went up gradually, from just over 3 per cent in the beginning of 2008, to a peak of 4.4 per cent in September. It then sank, down to 0.9 per cent in December, back to within the central bank Riksbanken's target rate of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point. The Repo interest rate was changed by Riksbanken six times in 2008. At the beginning of the year it was 4.0 per cent; it was then increased three times, up to 4.75 per cent in September. The recession then forced Riksbanken into counter‐measures, and by the end of year the Repo rate was down to 2.0 per cent – its lowest level since the first half of 2006.</p>
