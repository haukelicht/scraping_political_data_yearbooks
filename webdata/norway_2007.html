         <p>Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg made several changes to the cabinet in 2008. In February, Minister of Children and Equality Manuela Ramin‐Osmundsen had to leave the Cabinet less then half a year after her investiture (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2008</a></span>: 1091). A scandal unfolded over the way she had been handling the process of appointing a new Commissioner for Children. The former Commissioner's first term was over, but he legally applied for a second term. However, the job was given to Ida Hjort Kraby, with whom the Minister was later found to be personally associated. The press also revealed that Ramin‐Osmundsen had encouraged Hjort Kraby to apply. For several days, she refused to acknowledge any of this. The political opposition, through the Parliamentary Control Committee, called the Minister to an open hearing on the issue. However, before it came to this she met with the Prime Minister and confessed. Prime Minister Stoltenberg and Ramin‐Osmundsen then agreed that she should step down as Minister of Children and Equality. Experts agreed that Ramin‐Osmundsen had not done anything illegal by appointing Hjort Kraby since the latter was not disqualified because of her relationship to the Minister. The breach of trust and not telling the truth was, however, a bigger concern. Hjort Kraby also stepped down shortly afterwards, stressing that there should be no question about the Ombudsman's independence. Ramin‐Osmundsen was replaced by Anniken Huitfeldt, a young but much more experienced politician from the Labour Party.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another scandal led Minister of Petroleum and Energy Åslaug Haga to resign in June. She cited health problems following a building violations scandal as her reason for resigning. The scandal was related to illegal building projects at both her family's summer and permanent homes. Haga initially tried to fight the growing allegations against her, and resorted to blaming the media for taking issues out of context and invading her family's privacy. Supporters claimed the violations themselves were not major, but they did raise questions about her credibility in failing to follow regulations that her own party had championed. The revelations came just months after Haga had been faced with serious questions over alleged backroom dealing to win support for the Winter Olympics in Tromsø, as well as her role in arranging a state consultancy job for a party colleague who had been forced to resign from another state‐funded position. Haga, who was one of three ‘architects’ behind the red‐green coalition government, had already planned to step down as leader of the Centre Party before the scandal broke, but the scandal and the health issues accelerated things. Liv Signe Navarsete, Norway's Minister of Transport, took over as the party's new leader. In the Cabinet, Haga was replaced by Lars Peder Brekk, a Centre Party MP. Brekk became the new Minister of Agriculture and Food, while the former Minister of Agriculture and Food, Terje Riis‐Johansen (also from the Centre Party), became the new Minister of Petroleum and Energy.</p>
         
         <p>Spurred by Åslaug Haga's resignation, Prime Minister Stoltenberg also decided to reshuffle some Labour Party Cabinet members. Allegedly, Minister of Health and Care Services Sylvia Brustad wanted a smaller and less demanding ministry and was therefore moved to become Minister of Trade and Industry. This change saw the former Minister of Trade and Industry, Dag Terje Andersen, take the position as new Minister of Labour and Social Inclusion. Finally, Bjarne Håkon Hansen, former Minister of Labour and Social Inclusion, took over as new Minister of Health and Care Services. Hansen was seen as a strong enough politician to deal with the challenges and turmoil that had been affecting the sector.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>At the beginning of 2008 two broad parliamentary settlements were made on issues that had been discussed in Norwegian politics for quite some time. On 16 January, all parties in Parliament, with the exception of the Progress Party, agreed on a climate agreement. The agreement was seen as very ambitious in that one important goal is that Norway should become ‘climate neutral’ within 2030. This indicates that Norway should purchase climate quotas, or take other measures to secure international reduction of CO<sup>2</sup> that is equal to the level of Norwegian emissions. This indicates that Norway will reduce emissions by 10 per cent more than it is obliged to do by the Kyoto Agreement. The agreement stated that two‐thirds of the emissions should be from Norway. The Progress Party was not a part of this agreement, as it does not believe global warming is caused by human activity and is critical of the conclusions of the UN Climate Panel.
         </p>
         
         <p>The other broad parliamentary agreement made in 2008 included all parties, even the Progress Party. For quite some time there had been an intensive debate about the Norwegian State Church (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2007</a></span>: 1060–1061). While the Church, the Christian organisations, and the Christian Democratic Party and the Socialist Left Party wanted to separate church from state, most of the other parties in Parliament wanted to maintain a close link. The agreement reached stated that the link between the Church and the Norwegian state should remain, and that the Church still should be publicly financed. After the new agreement the Church can, however, now select its own leaders and there is no longer a requirement that at least 50 per cent of cabinet members should be members of the State Church. The agreement also demanded that the Church should become more democratic.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cabinet disagreement about three other issues led the media to talk about a ‘dissent democracy’ in 2008. The first issue was related to a new gender‐neutral Marriage Act. Registered partnerships had been allowed since 1993, but several interest organisations and others wanted to improve gay rights by establishing a new same sex Marriage Act. Two cabinet members from the Centre Party did not agree with the rest of the Cabinet in welcoming a new Marriage Act, and publicly announced their dissent. The Progress Party and the Christian Democratic Party also voted against the new Marriage Act, but it was nevertheless carried in Parliament on 11 June. The new Act secures gay couples the right to adopt and access to fertility treatment.</p>
         
         <p>The next disagreement stemmed from ministers from the Socialist Left Party who did not support the Cabinet's policy on stricter regulations related to asylum seekers. Norway had, next to the Netherlands, experienced the largest increase in the arrivals of asylum seekers in Europe in 2008. By the first half of 2008 twice as many asylum seekers had arrived compared to the same period in 2007, although 60 per cent of applications for asylum are rejected. According to Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, Norway needed new measures to decrease the number of those seeking asylum without a genuine claim. This should secure the right of asylum for those who really need it, but also improve asylum seekers' integration into Norwegian society. The Socialist Left Party argued however, that the new regulations were going against the Soria Moria declaration (their initial coalition agreement) and expressed their dissent on eight out of thirteen new measures. (The Centre Party's dissent over the gender neutral Marriage Act was already heralded in the Soria Moria declaration.) The Centre Party had not agreed to all of the initially proposed measures either, but managed to compromise with Labour. Two questions were of particular concern for the Socialist Left Party: how to treat minors seeking asylum and how one should relate to the advice given by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The new measures declared that each asylum case should be examined individually rather than undergo a general group assessment based on the particular geographical area. Moreover, unaccompanied minors who are 16 years or older and who are given residency simply because Norwegian authorities cannot locate their parents/family can now be granted temporary residency without the right to renewal.</p>
         
         <p>Finally a third disagreement was related to the incorporation of the EU Services Directive into the EEA Agreement. The ministers from the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party expressed their dissent when the matter was dealt with in the Council of State. The two parties, who are against Norwegian EU membership, wanted to use the reservation right in the EEA agreement to reject the new directive. The ministers from the Centre Party and the Socialist Left Party declared that they could not recommend the Storting to vote in favour. They argued that the Services Directive would undermine efforts to prevent social dumping and jeopardise labour rights. They were also concerned about its influence on national sovereignty in important sectors. However, the cabinet majority consisting of Labour ministers submitted a proposition recommending that the Storting say ‘yes’ to the Service Directive. A proposition is scheduled to be submitted to the Storting during the 2009 spring session.</p>
         
         <p>The turmoil in the international financial markets also influenced developments and political debate in Norway. Although the Norwegian economy is fundamentally strong, the uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy was making the country's economic prospects more uncertain. Therefore, the fiscal budget presented by Stoltenberg II in October allowed a higher use of petroleum revenues to secure jobs and public welfare. According to Stoltenberg II's political profile and earlier promises, the overall level of taxation was kept unchanged, but the redistributional effects of the tax system were said to be improved. Shortly after the fiscal budget was presented, Stoltenberg II also presented the first Norwegian bank aid package on 12 October. The opposition in Parliament was surprisingly uncritical of the proposed budget and the bank aid package. The major gripe was that the budget could have been even more extensive, and that the bank aid package perhaps came a bit late.</p>
         
         <p>It is also worth mentioning that Stoltenberg II reached a decision in the heated debate about which new fighter planes Norway should buy (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2008</a></span>: 1094). In what will be Norway's largest arms investment ever, the Socialist Left Party wanted the purchase to send clear political signals towards which country Norway should strengthen its relationship. The party therefore wanted to choose fighter planes from a Swedish producer, but the contract was awarded to the American firm, Lockheed Martin. The argument was that this was a better buy militarily. Although the party obviously was not happy with this solution, they did not express dissent on this issue.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, the second half of 2008 was affected by another political scandal. The Public Accounts Committee filed a report to the Storting Presidium stating that six former MPs had been paid 6 million Norwegian kroner too much from the Storting pension scheme over a ten‐year period. Among the six were previous prime ministers Gro Harlem Bruntland (AP) and Kjell Magne Bondevik (KrF). Criticisms were made both of the politicians for not following the rules that applied and of the scheme itself for being too complicated. An independent expert committee was established to investigate the matter.</p>
