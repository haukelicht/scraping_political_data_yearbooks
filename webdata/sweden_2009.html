         <p>The political year of 2010 was very eventful. In some respects it is not an exaggeration to call it historic. The parliamentary election resulted in the entry into parliament of the Sweden Democrats, an historical high point for the Moderate Party and a ditto low point for the Social Democrats. The four‐party centre‐right Alliance coalition stayed in office, but lost its outright majority. The first major reshuffle of the Government took place after the election. Sweden emerged out of the 2008–2009 economic recession comparatively unharmed, with the qualification that unemployment remained high. A number of key reforms of the political and legal system were decided.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Election to the national parliament</h2>
         
         <p>The red–green opposition bloc, consisting of the Social Democratic, Left and Green parties, had more or less constantly been ahead of the Government in opinion polls after the 2006 election. In early 2010, the polls still suggested that a change of government was possible. As the election drew nearer, however, the Government bloc, consisting of the Moderate Party, Centre Party, Christian Democrats and the People's Party Liberals, edged in front. When the campaign began in earnest in August, an Alliance victory seemed the most likely outcome. The only question mark was whether a possible entry into parliament by the Sweden Democrats would deprive the Government of its outright majority.</p>
         
         <p>The campaign was by no means uninteresting, but largely free of scandals. It was, however, becoming increasingly likely that the immigration‐critical Sweden Democrats would enter parliament, and this caused some unrest. On a number of occasions protesters tried to disturb Sweden Democrat election meetings, but the counter‐demonstrators rarely went beyond noise‐making.</p>
         
         <p>A considerable part of the campaign was focused on welfare issues. The opposition criticised the Government for welfare cuts, and pledged to restore the unemployment benefit to its former level of 80 per cent of previous income.</p>
         
         <p>Another issue was the tightening of the criteria for sickness benefits introduced by the Government. There were media reports of cancer patients being forced to seek new jobs after their sickness benefit entitlement had expired. The Government response was that some details of the rules would be looked into, but that the reforms were intended to increase incentives to work, and that job stimulation remained a priority.</p>
         
         <p>In many ways the election result was an endorsement of the Alliance Government. The combined share of votes for the four governing parties increased, as did the gap to the opposition bloc. The Moderate Party improved on its already record‐breaking result from 2006, and came within 35,731 votes of overtaking the once‐dominant Social Democrats as the country's biggest party. There were several reasons for the Moderate success, but the impact of the leading personalities could hardly be overestimated. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Minister of Finance Anders Borg both command considerable levels of trust among the electorate, and their perceived competence outshone that of their Social Democratic counterparts. The next step for the Moderate Party, to take over from the Social Democrats as the ‘natural’ party of government, no longer seems unrealistic. The other Alliance parties, however, lost votes and seats. Indeed the Centre and, especially, Christian Democratic parties sank to levels dangerously close to the 4 per cent representational threshold. This imbalance in the coalition could provide problems for government cohesion in the future. Above all, the Government lost its majority due to the entry of the Sweden Democrats.</p>
         
         <p>The Social Democrats lost 4.3 percentage points compared to its result from 2006, which in its own right was a negative record for the once‐dominant party. This meltdown has a number of long‐term structural explanations, such as a decline in class and party identification, but short‐term factors also played a part. The Social Democratic leader since 2007, Mona Sahlin, did not go down well with the voters, and could not challenge Reinfeldt's position as the most suitable leader of the country. The party also seems to have suffered from the inclusion of the Left Party in a possible government coalition. The Left Party had, somewhat reluctantly, agreed with its prospective coalition partners to abandon its rejection of the budget process framework, which was introduced in the 1990s and is designed to ensure fiscal stability (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Pierre &amp; Widfeldt 1997</a></span>: 499ff; see also below). The formerly communist Left Party was still considered by many as too radical and irresponsible, and its inclusion in a prospective coalition was seen as damaging to the other two red–green parties. Other strategic mistakes by Social Democrats included plans to spend a large part of the proposed reform expenditures on reduced income tax for pensioners, and to make changes to the property tax, which had been reformed by the Alliance Government. Much of the responsibility for the defeat fell on Sahlin. Initially she seemed willing to stay as leader but after internal pressure she announced her resignation on 14 November. Sahlin thus became the most short‐lived leader in the 121‐year history of the party. The Greens recorded their best‐ever result, although some polls had suggested even more than the eventual 7.9 per cent, while the Left Party suffered a marginal loss.
         </p>
         
         <p>At least as significant as the results for the two biggest parties was the breakthrough of the Sweden Democrats, which received more votes than the Christian Democrats as well as the Left Party. Fitting neatly into a trend with 1.4 per cent in 2002 and 2.9 per cent in 2006, the result of 5.7 per cent was not unexpected. Indeed, the party had been above the 4 per cent threshold in a growing number of opinion polls from 2007 onwards. The Sweden Democrats is a populist and anti‐establishment party, with criticism of immigration as its main priority. Unlike comparable parties in Denmark, Finland and Norway, the Sweden Democrats has a compromising background with roots in a militant anti‐immigration subculture. Formed in 1988 it was for many years a fringe party, but following a process of de‐radicalisation of the programme, more careful scrutiny of the members and a general tidying up of its image, the Sweden Democrats began to build up a growing support base from the early 2000s (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Rydgren 2006</a></span>; <span title=""><a href="#b7%20#b9" id="#b7 #b9R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2008</a></span>). The 32‐year old Jimmie Åkesson, leader of the party since 2005, could hardly be described as charismatic in the original sense of the concept, but is a competent media performer and has added credibility to the party. The election result meant that the Sweden Democrats holds the balance of power between the Alliance and the red–green bloc. All seven other parliamentary parties declared that they will not in any way cooperate with the Sweden Democrats. This means that the 2010–2014 election period could be characterised by parliamentary instability.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Cabinet report and issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Before the election, two changes occurred in the Alliance Government. In November 2009, EU Minister Cecilia Malmström had been announced as Sweden's next EU Commissioner (<span title=""><a href="#b10" id="#b10R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2010</a></span>: 1182ff), but she did not leave the Government until 22 January. On 2 February, Birgitta Ohlsson was announced as Malmström's successor, which meant that the post stayed with the People's Party Liberals. On 7 July, the Moderate Party Minister for Employment Sven Otto Littorin unexpectedly announced his resignation, citing personal reasons and media pressures following a marriage separation. The following day the tabloid <i>Aftonbladet</i> reported that Littorin's reason for resigning was that the newspaper had confronted him with allegations of having committed a crime. A few days later, the alleged offence was specified as the purchase of sex, which was criminalised in 1999 (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Aftonbladet</i></a></span>, 8 and 10 July 2010). Littorin denied the allegations, but stated that they had contributed to his decision to resign (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Dagens Nyheter</i></a></span>, 14 July 2010). Prime Minister Reinfeldt was criticised for not immediately coming clean about the reasons for the resignation. The story received much media attention in July, but was off the agenda when the election campaign started in August and cannot be said to have damaged the Government. Littorin was not replaced in the cabinet before the election. His portfolio was temporarily handed to Minister for Migration Tobias Billström.
         </p>
         
         <p>Despite having lost its overall majority, there was never any serious doubt that the Alliance Government would remain in office after the election. Until 2010, an incumbent Swedish government was not by default subject to a vote of confidence or investiture after an election. It was (and still is) possible for a tenth of MPs to initiate a vote of confidence against the government, and if this happened shortly after an election it in practice amounted to a vote of investiture. Such votes did not take place after every election, but did so after the polls in 1998 and 2002. It would, therefore, have been technically possible for the opposition to unseat the Government if the Sweden Democrats had supported a motion of no‐confidence. Any such influence of the Sweden Democrats was out of the question for the other opposition parties, however, and a motion of no‐confidence was not tabled when the newly elected parliament met in early October. The four‐party Alliance Government could thus continue in office without a vote in parliament and, significantly, without any reliance on support from the Sweden Democrats. New rules regarding the status of the government after an election came into effect on 1 January 2011 (see <a href="#ss5" class="scrollableLink"><b>Institutional changes</b></a> below).
         </p>
         
         <p>After the election, the Government was subject to its first major reshuffle since taking office in 2006. The preceding negotiations were difficult. The victorious Moderate Party wanted its increased share of parliamentary seats to be reflected in the composition of the Government, but the three junior coalition partners strongly resisted the proposal to reduce their respective shares of cabinet posts. In the end a compromise was reached whereby the total number of ministers was increased from 22 (the number before the resignation of Littorin) to 24. This allowed the Moderate Party to increase its share of posts in the Government, while the smaller parties kept their respective absolute numbers of ministers.</p>
         
         <p>The key posts of Finance, Foreign Affairs and Justice remained with Anders Borg, Carl Bildt and Beatrice Ask, respectively – all from the Moderate Party. The post of Deputy Prime Minister, however, went from Centre Party leader Maud Olofsson to Jan Björklund, leader of the People's Party Liberals, reflecting the fact that the latter party had taken over as the second biggest of the government parties. Four ministers were effectively sacked; the Minister for Social Affairs, Cristina Husmark Pehrsson (Moderate); the Minister for Financial Markets and Local Government, Mats Odell (Christian Democrat); the Minister for Infrastructure, Asa Torstensson (Centre); and the Minister for Higher Education and Research, Tobias Krantz (People's Party Liberals). Most of the seven newly appointed ministers had a solid background in their respective parties with the possible exception of the Minister for Financial Markets, Peter Norman, who allegedly joined the Moderate Party a few days before his appointment. Five out of the seven new ministers had parliamentary experience (this also applies to Ohlsson, who had been appointed in January). The exceptions were Norman and the Centre Party Minister for Information Technology and Regional Affairs, Anna‐Karin Hatt, who, together with Finance Minister Anders Borg, were the only three ministers without any parliamentary experience. Compared to the situation as of 1 January 2010, the gender balance remained the same: 13 men and 11 women compared to 12 and 10, respectively, but the average age went down from 48.6 to 47.5 years.</p>
         
         <p>The fact that the Reinfeldt Government no longer had a majority became apparent almost immediately. Deals with the Sweden Democrats were out of the question, but almost as impossible were the prospects of far‐reaching deals with any of the red–green parties. To be sure, the red–green cooperation pact was announced as dissolved on 26 October, but this did not automatically mean that the Greens or Social Democrats were ready to cooperate with the Government on a permanent basis. Negotiations between the red–green parties and the Sweden Democrats were out of the question, but there was nothing to prevent the latter party from voting with the opposition, thus inflicting defeats on the Government. An early possible crisis was avoided when a deal was reached with the Greens about Sweden's continued involvement in the NATO‐led ISAF mission in Afghanistan in early November. Nevertheless, the Sweden Democrats contributed to defeats of two government bills before the end of the year. The most significant case occurred on 9 December, when they voted with the opposition to reduce funds allocated to the government organisation. This decision was part of the budget process, whose regulatory framework had been reformed in the 1990s, in order to make government defeats more difficult (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Pierre &amp; Widfeldt 1997</a></span>). The framework is, however, designed to prevent the opposition from forcing through increased expenditure but, as it turned out, does not prevent government defeats if the opposition proposal is to reduce spending. The Government criticised the opposition for lack of responsibility, and declared that, among other things, a number of Swedish embassies may have to close as a consequence of the vote (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Dagens Nyheter</i></a></span>, 11, 22 and 23 December 2010). At the end of the year, it seemed possible that the parliamentary instability would continue for the remainder of the 2010–2014 parliamentary term.
         </p>
         
         <p>Economically, the year 2010 confirmed indications in late 2009 that Sweden would escape from the 2008–2009 recession comparatively unharmed. The GDP growth rate, which had been negative in 2009, made a spectacular recovery to +5.5 per cent in 2010, according to a report published in March 2010 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER). The same organisation projected a relative slowdown of the growth rate to 4.2 per cent in 2011 and 3.1 per cent in 2012, but essentially the outlook was positive. In response to the increased growth the central bank, Riksbanken, raised the Repo interest rate four times during the year. At the beginning of 2010 it was 0.25 per cent, but in December it had been raised by one percentage point to 1.25 per cent. The fiscal deficit, which in 2009 amounted to SEK176.1 billion (approx. €17 billion), sank to a marginal SEK1.1 billion (approx. €0.1 billion) in 2010, according to the National Debt Office, which also reported that the national debt had sunk to SEK1.151 billion (approx. €115 billion) by the end of 2010 – a reduction of SEK38 billion compared to 12 months earlier. Relative to GDP, the national debt sank from 39 to 35 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The one area that led to concern was the labour market, where recovery was slow. The car industry was in trouble, and the National Debt Office secured loans to Volvo as well as SAAB. Both these flagship companies changed ownership in 2010 (Volvo to the Chinese company Geely and SAAB to the Dutch company Spyker) and the future of especially SAAB was uncertain. To be sure, the number of announced redundancies fell from 115,000 in 2009 to 44,000 in 2010, and open unemployment sank marginally compared to 2009, from 4.0 per cent to 3.9 per cent of the adult population. The proportion involved in labour market schemes rose from 2.0 to 3.0 per cent, however, meaning that the overall rate of unemployment rose by 0.9 percentage points. Especially youth unemployment was a concern (figures from the Swedish Public Employment Service). According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12 month changes in Consumer Price Index) was below 1 per cent in the early months of 2010, but rose towards the end of the year. In December it reached 2.3 per cent, which was still within the Riksbanken's target rate of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>Three months after the election, parliament decided on a number of changes to the Constitution and legal and political system. The reforms had originally been proposed by <i>Grundlagsutredningen</i>– a cross‐party commission of inquiry, whose final report was presented in December 2008 (SOU 2008:125). The proposals had then gone through a referral process before they were presented to parliament by the Government in late 2009. Since many of the proposals required constitutional amendments, the reforms had to be approved by two parliamentary votes, with an election between them. The first vote was held on 2 June 2010, and the second confirmatory vote on 24 November. The extensive reform package included many changes of a technical nature, and the following is a brief summary of some key points.
         </p>
         
         <p>Swedish membership of the European Union was written into the Constitution. Wordings against discrimination, also extended to include children, were strengthened in the Constitution, as was the right for minorities, including the Sami population, to maintain and develop their own culture. The Prime Minister, and by implication the whole government, was made subject to a compulsory vote of confidence or investiture after every election, irrespective of the election result. Parliamentary and subnational elections continue to be held on the same date, but the day was changed from the third to the second Sunday of September. The threshold for personal preferences to take effect in parliamentary elections was lowered from preferences amounting to 8 per cent, to 5 per cent, of the party's vote in a constituency. It became possible for local councils to dissolve themselves and hold extra elections. The requirement of manifestness in judicial review (i.e., that a court or other public authority shall disregard a law provision only if it is obviously (manifestly) unconstitutional) was dropped (compare <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>The Constitution of Sweden</i> 2003</a></span>: 43). The changes, which were codified into several different constitutional as well as ordinary laws, took effect on 1 January 2011. They were supported by all parliamentary parties except the Sweden Democrats (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Riksdag &amp; Departement</i></a></span> 35/2010; <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Dagens Nyheter</i></a></span>, 24 November 2010).
