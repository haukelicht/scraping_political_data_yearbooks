         <p>The first six months of German politics in 2007 were largely dominated by foreign and European affairs because it was Germany's turn to preside over the G8 and the European Union (EU) at the same time. This coincidence provided Chancellor Angela Merkel with a formidable opportunity to escape from the rather cumbersome domestic politics of Grand Coalition stalemate and gain profile as a leading politician on the international stage. At the G8 summit in the northeastern seaside resort of Heiligendamm in June, she managed to improve her image as a politician taking the problem of climate change seriously when the summit agreed to reduce detrimental greenhouse emissions by 50 per cent until 2050 – even though many environmental campaigners criticised this as ‘too little too late’. The summit was accompanied by unprecedented security measures (including a huge fence around the conference site that made the area look a bit like pre‐1989 Berlin) and by large, occasionally violent demonstrations by the anti‐globalisation movement. While the tangible outcomes of G8 summits are always somewhat questionable, the German EU presidency successfully concluded the difficult recovery mission that followed the rejection of the EU Constitutional Treaty by referenda in the Netherlands and France. The decisive steps towards the Treaty of Lisbon were taken under the stewardship of Chancellor Merkel, who gained national and international kudos for this.</p>

         <p>Domestic affairs were characterised by a noticeable shift of the political agenda towards a stronger emphasis on redistributive measures, including a heated debate over the level of top managerial salaries and surprisingly strong public support for a disruptive strike by German train drivers who demanded a sharp pay rise. In hindsight, the Bundestag decision of March to raise the retirement age to 67 almost looks like a swan song for the neoliberal reform agenda. What followed represented a significant departure from the late Schröder years, which had been dominated by neoliberal reforms and pretty harsh cuts in welfare benefits. In an attempt to move the SPD leftwards and reach a rapprochement with the trade unions that had been alienated by the Agenda policies under Chancellor Schröder, SPD leader Kurt Beck successfully pushed for more generous regulations concerning the payment of unemployment benefit. This led to an intense internal debate within the party between pro‐welfare traditionalists who had always been critical of Gerhard Schröder's course and those who wanted to continue on the path of newly acquired economic realism. In the end, the coalition decided to extend the duration of unemployment payments for older people in late 2007. This was widely regarded as a defeat of Labour Minister and Vice‐Chancellor Franz Müntefering who, in November, resigned shortly after this decision for private reasons.</p>
         
         <p>The demand for the introduction of a general minimum wage was another highly visible element in Kurt Beck's strategy to sharpen the SPD's left‐wing profile. While this was widely supported within his own party (and a large proportion of the general public), this suggestion was met with resistance by its Christian Democratic coalition partners. The debate continued through much of 2007 and eventually led to a partial compromise in November, which did not remove the item from the agenda. The decision by the Green Party conference of November, when they called for a costly spending programme, is another example of a general trend towards more spending that partially may be the result of the last federal election, which showed that German voters are generally pro‐welfare. Furthermore, positive economic developments seemed to permit such policies. With fairly good growth rates, falling unemployment and rising tax revenue, politicians seemed to feel that the need to balance the budget was less imperative than previously – even though the rise in state revenue was partially the result of a 3 per cent VAT (value added tax) rise that was introduced at the beginning of 2007.</p>
         
         <p>Both large parties accepted new basic party programmes in 2007. The CDU approved its new programme (only the third in its history) at the Hannover party congress of December 2007 and the SPD passed its Hamburg programme in October. While new basic programmes are rare events in German party politics, they usually do not attract much attention as they often conclude a protracted process of internal debate. The extraordinary party congress of the Green Party in September, on the other hand, attracted much more public interest because it was forced upon the party leadership by the rank‐and‐file, which disagreed with the position of the majority of the Bundestag parliamentary party on Germany's Afghanistan mission. The congress ended with a defeat of the party leadership and the majority of Green MPs abstained in the next relevant vote on that matter. The most significant party political development of 2007 was the completion of the merger between the largely Western WASG and the former PDS into a new party called ‘The Left’ (‘<i>Die Linke</i>’). Following the approval of the merger contract in March, a founding congress on 16 June 2007 elected the former SPD chair Oskar Lafontaine (now coming from the WASG) and Lothar Bisky of the former PDS as party chairs. Last but not least, following a fairly petty affair, a groundswell of intra‐party discontent with the incumbent Bavarian CSU Prime Minister (and 2002 Chancellor candidate) Edmund Stoiber led to his resignation. This was remarkable on two counts: first, Stoiber had polled an unprecedented two‐thirds majority in the previous Bavarian <i>Land</i> election and, second, it led to an unusually long leadership contest within the CSU.

         <p>Other relevant issues in German national politics included a debate over more generous funding of day care institutions to combat falling birth rates and improving the opportunities for women to combine motherhood with an occupational career. Unsurprisingly, this was not uncontroversial within the Christian parties even though the initiative had been taken by the Christian Minister for Family, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth Ursula von der Leyen. In May, elections in the city state of Bremen brought the Greens back into government above the local level for the first time since they lost <i>Land</i> elections in NRW (Nordrhein‐Westfalen) in May 2005. Also, a committee of parliamentary inquiry looking into the handling by the red‐green government of the imprisonment of a Turkish‐born German citizen in Guantanamo continued to attract much public attention – not least because the former and current Ministers for Foreign Affairs Joschka Fischer (Greens) and Frank‐Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had to face tough questions.
