         <p>As with last year, this article considers the events or issues during the year in their order of importance as assessed by me. However, first let it be noted that there were certain characteristics identical as between 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2004. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Liberal Party was identical (John Howard). So, too, were the leaders of the National Party (John Anderson), the Democrats (Senator Andrew Bartlett) and the Greens (Senator Bob Brown).</p>
         
         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss2"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss2-title"> The invasion of Iraq</h3>
            
            <p>There would be little dispute that the invasion of Iraq was the most important issue in Australia as elsewhere. However, the Australian situation was very unusual because, in my opinion, the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ consisted of only six countries: the four joining the invasion with troops and the two adjoining countries (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) from whose territory the invasion was actually launched. In order of size of troop numbers, the four countries supplying troops for the invasion were: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland.</p>
            
            <p>The Australian contribution was only 2,000 troops and not a single casualty was suffered. Yet the commitment was very controversial. It was opposed by the Labor Opposition, the Democrats, the Greens and public opinion generally. At the end of the year, however, it seemed to have done the Howard Government no electoral damage at all. Howard and his ministers completed the year looking forward confidently to yet another general election victory, which is likely in October 2004.</p>
            
            <p>When I refer to public opinion opposing the invasion, my only basis for such an assessment was the state of the polls. In January, Howard announced a forward deployment of troops, which prompted an interesting opinion poll. The poll found that 62 per cent of respondents thought Australian troops should only be involved as part of a force approved by the United Nations. However, 32 per cent thought Australia should not be involved in any circumstances. A miserable 6 per cent agreed with the decision the Howard Government was clearly going to take – namely, to join a small number of countries in a ‘Coalition of the Willing’ to invade Iraq without United Nations authority. One commentator summed up the situation in this way:</p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>At the end of the year, Iraq was all well and truly over for Australia. We had joined ‘the hard part’ (actually the easy part, namely the invasion itself) and withdrawn most of our troops from Iraq by the middle of the year. Consequently, public opinion shifted greatly. We had, in Howard's words, ‘moved on’ and commentators were left wondering how it could be that George Bush and Tony Blair were left in controversy over Iraq while Howard escaped with almost no apparent loss of face at all.</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>Commentators agreed that, on the Iraq question at least, there were two answers to the riddle of why Howard managed to escape unscathed. The first was the remarkable fact that not a single Australian soldier had been killed. The second was the general hopelessness of the then Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean. His opinion poll ratings were very poor all year. So much so that in June the former leader, Kim Beazley, challenged Crean for the Labor leadership. However, in the caucus vote, Crean secured 58 votes to Beazley's 34. By year's end Crean's position had become so hopeless that he resigned the leadership and the caucus vote on the second of December was 47 votes for the newcomer Mark Latham to 45 votes for Beazley. It is interesting to see how this event relates to the invasion of Iraq.</p>
            
            <p>One of Beazley's problems was that he had been seen to be too pro‐American. Traditionally this would not have been a problem in the Australian context. However, even in Australia the mood was becoming anti‐Bush and, therefore, anti‐American. This suited Latham well. During the Iraq parliamentary debate in February and March, Latham had been vehement in his denunciation of George Bush and John Howard's relationship to the American President. He had described Howard as an ‘arse‐licker’ to Bush. Politicians in the Liberal and National parties were a ‘conga line of suckholes’. George Bush was ‘dangerous and flaky’ and ‘the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory’.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

            <p>Did the Howard Government get any political benefit from contributing 2,000 Australian troops to the Anglo‐American invasion of Iraq? In one sense, yes. Howard received a ‘pat on the back’ from President Bush. For that reason, October was clearly the best month of the year for the Australian Prime Minister. By a nice coincidence, the American President was in Canberra for the whole of Thursday, 23 October, while the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, was in Canberra for the whole of Friday, 24 October. Both were invited to address a joint sitting of the two houses of the Australian Parliament. The only significance of the speeches was that Howard had been able to call Parliament together on successive days to hear speeches by the presidents of, first, the most powerful nation in the world and, second, the most populous nation in the world.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> The refugee issue</h3>
            
            <p>Much of my commentaries for 2001 and 2002 were taken up by the refugee issue. In particular, I made clear my view that the Howard Government used propaganda against refugees as a major weapon in its campaign for reelection in November 2001. It invented a so‐called ‘Pacific Solution’ to the ‘problem’ of asylum‐seekers. The Pacific Solution involved making arrangements with Papua New Guinea and Nauru so that those countries should take the refugees who actually wanted to come to Australia. The phrase used in the election campaign was ‘border protection’, but its purpose was to tap xenophobia within the Australian community.</p>
            
            <p>I referred in those commentaries to the extraordinary degree of luck going the Government's way, which added to the draconian measures it had taken. The luck continued in 2003. Not a single boat carrying unauthorised arrivals was allowed to land. Thus the Government was able to claim 2003 as yet another outstanding year of success in its anti‐refugee policies, which are based on turning asylum‐seeker boats back and, where that fails, persecuting them within Australia.</p>
            
            <p>However, three further developments for 2003 need to be noted. The first was the Government's success in reducing the number of detainees in Nauru to only 284 at the end of the year. This was done by offering detainees substantial payments to go back to Afghanistan or Iraq (as the case may be). Since the Taliban and Saddam Hussein had fallen it was quite easy to justify sending them back. The 284 remaining in Nauru were those who refused the offer. They hoped luck would cut their way and that eventually they would get visas for residence in Australia. They continued to be convinced that they would be persecuted in Afghanistan/Iraq.</p>
            
            <p>During the year, luck did cut the way of one celebrated detainee at the Baxter Detention Centre in South Australia. His name was Ibrahim Sammaki and his circumstances were unusual. He had escaped from Iran with his wife and children to Indonesia. He then came by ‘unauthorised’ boat to Australia leaving his wife and children behind in Indonesia. After the usual stacked inquiry by the Government into his refugee status, he was declared not to be a genuine refugee so he was put behind the razor wire at Baxter. Then his wife was killed in the Bali bombing of October 2002 referred to in last year's commentary. If the Australian Government had been possessed of any compassion it would have recognised that the children were now orphans, released their father and allowed the children to join him as Australian residents – but no, compassion is not the strong suit of the Howard Government.</p>
            
            <p>Then a very unusual event occurred. Prime Minister Howard went to Bali in October on the anniversary of the bombing to commemorate the event. The children in question were photographed with Howard who assumed they were ‘any old’ foreign‐looking children. It was a good photo opportunity for him. The photo was then printed in Australian newspapers with a description of what had happened. The new Immigration Minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, very soon announced that her first ‘compassionate’ decision was to release Ibrahim Sammaki from Baxter, give him a visa for permanent residence and allow his children to join him. When asked by one interviewer whether the photograph had anything to do with the decision, she chided the interviewer for being unduly cynical. Apparently she expected to be commended for her compassion. Unsurprisingly, the government continued to insist that Sammaki was not a genuine refugee.</p>
            
            <p>Early in November another event occurred. A boat, the <i>Minasa Bone</i>, carrying 14 Turkish Kurds landed on Melville Island north of Darwin undetected by Australian authorities. They wanted to claim asylum. However, the government acted swiftly and retrospectively excised all islands from Australia's migration zone. The purpose of that legalistic manoeuvre was to deny the asylum seekers the benefit of Australian law. The Navy then towed the boat back to Indonesian waters. Eventually all 14 returned to Turkey. Immigration Minister Vanstone then claimed that ‘none of the 14 asylum seekers were genuine refugees. The return of the <i>Minasa Bone</i>'s passengers is a slap in the face to the people smugglers.’ On this occasion, at least, it seems the Government was probably right – even though its action was contrary to the 1951 Convention on Refugees to which Australia is still a signatory.

         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> The Australian states</h3>
            
            <p>The year 2002 witnessed the end of a process that had been going on for some years. It is now the case that all six state premiers and both territory chief ministers are from the Labor Party – the party that constitutes the federal Opposition. In order of seniority, these Labor leaders of the states/territories are: Bob Carr (New South Wales, gaining office in April 1995), Peter Beattie (Queensland, June 1998), Jim Bacon (Tasmania, September 1998), Steve Bracks (Victoria, October 1999), Geoff Gallop (Western Australia, February 2001), Clare Martin (Northern Territory, August 2001), Jon Stanhope (Australian Capital Territory, November 2001) and Mike Rann (South Australia, March 2002).</p>
            
            <p>The year 2003 saw one of these governments face the people. There was a general election in New South Wales in March and Labor won 55 of the 93 seats in the lower house, exactly the same number as Labor had won in March 1999. Commentators were struck by the large number of people who had voted for John Howard's Liberal Party at the federal level and then voted for Bob Carr's Labor Party at state elections.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss5"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss5-title"> Departure of the Governor‐General</h3>
            
            <p>During 2002 the then Governor‐General, Dr Peter Hollingworth, had started to get into political trouble. It was all caused by the fact that he had previously been Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane and criticism arose due to his handling of cases of sexual abuse complaints at Anglican schools. His problems deepened in 2003 and eventually he resigned in May. In August, his place was taken by Major‐General Michael Jeffery, who had been Governor of Western Australia from 1993 to 2001 and was the first governor‐general with a military background since Field Marshal Sir William Slim who held the office from 1953 to 1960. The choice of a Governor‐General who had been a state governor was thought to be a safe one: previously there had been one from 1936 to 1945 who was also a military man.</p>
            
         </section></section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss6"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss6-title"> Other events</h2>
         
         <p>In 2000, Howard had made remarks strongly suggesting that that he would resign around September 2003 and advise the Governor‐General to send for Peter Costello. He never retracted those remarks. He even gave every impression to Costello that the job would be his in 2003. However, in June he called Costello into his office and told him he would not be retiring. All Costello could do was indicate his intense disappointment and make clear he thought of himself as having been cheated. The Howard line now is that he will continue to lead the Liberal Party for as long as the party wants him to lead it.</p>
         
         <p>The issue of generational change will come up again in the 2004 general election campaign. In 2006, Howard will have been Prime Minister for ten years. At that time there will be three plausible holders of that office: John Howard born in July 1939, Peter Costello born in August 1957 and Mark Latham born in February 1961.</p>
         
         <p>Having decided against generational change for the highest office in the land, Howard decided to have a ministerial reshuffle instead. The new line up was announced on 29 September and the swearing in occurred on 7 October. What made this easy was the retirement of the then Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Richard Alston. The significant changes were that Philip Ruddock moved from Immigration to Attorney General, while Senator Amanda Vanstone moved from Family and Community Services to Immigration. The new member of cabinet is Kevin Andrews, who took over Employment and Workplace Relations from Tony Abbott who became the new Minister for Health.</p>
         
         <p>The Australian economy performed well throughout the year – better (so we are told) than the economy of any comparable country. (My perception is that we have been told the truth.) Certainly the value of the Australian dollar rose significantly. So too did house prices. In both cases there were negatives. Exporters disliked the strong Australian dollar policy. Young people wishing to become homeowners resented the rise in house prices that merely benefited existing owners. The drought largely broke and the population reached 20 million in 2003.</p>
         
         <p>One significant piece of infrastructure building was completed this year. For a century, politicians had promised that the rail network would span from south to north as well as east to west. From January 2004, trains ran from Adelaide to Darwin as well as from Sydney to Perth. Australia is now the only country in the world to have transcontinental railways both north–south and east–west.</p>
