         <p>The global financial crisis dominated much of German politics throughout 2009. The need to stabilise the banking system and the German economy pushed politicians into taking measures many of them would have rejected on ideological grounds before the collapse of Lehmann Brothers. Arguably the most conspicuous moves were the <i>de facto</i> nationalisation of many German banks by means of massive bailouts and a law passed in February that facilitated the expropriation of shareholders by the state because the government wanted to take control of a bank that had already been kept afloat by massive injections of public money. Also in February, the governing Grand Coalition launched a second spending package that included, among other measures, a ‘scrappage’ scheme to boost car sales by paying a lump sum to everyone who took their old car off the road in exchange for buying a new model.
         </p>
         
         <p>Overall, the Coalition acted efficiently and relatively cohesively in these turbulent times even though the upcoming general election (in September) provided incentives to seek political advantages at the expense of the coalition partner. Arguably the most visible effect of electoral considerations was seen in the debate over public money for the car‐maker Opel, owned by General Motors (GM). However, and probably indicative of the still fairly strong German consensus on managed capitalism, the debate was not really about the pros and cons of state money; instead, it was over <i>how</i> to prevent GM closing down car plants in Germany.
         </p>
         
         <p>Electoral politics were moulded by a series of Land elections and the general election of 27 September 2009. The early election in Hesse, which had become necessary after attempts by the SPD to form a coalition with the Left had failed in the previous year (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Poguntke 2009</a></span>), provided little hope for the Social Democrats: they lost 13 per cent, while FDP and Greens gained substantially. In the end, CDU Prime Minister Roland Koch was re‐elected, even though he had been close to losing office a year earlier and had only been able to lead a caretaker government for most of 2008.
         </p>
         
         <p>Overall, the results of second‐order elections sent rather ambiguous signals to the two large parties. In the European Parliament (EP) elections, the Social Democrats repeated their poor showing from 2004, while the Christian parties lost ground. Similarly, the August Land elections in Saxony, Thuringia and Saarland, which represented an important stepping stone in the run‐up to the general election, produced fairly inclusive outcomes. The Left scored impressive results, coming second in Thuringia and winning 21.3 per cent in Saarland, and the Greens and FDP generally did well, but the results for the Grand Coalition parties did not follow a clear trend – except for the clear pattern that at least one of them tended to lose substantially. To a large degree, this confirms the conventional wisdom that Land elections are influenced by national events, but also follow regional logics that tend to be rather diverse.</p>
         
         <p>When it came to the general election, however, the battle lines clearly favoured a so‐called ‘bourgeois coalition’ between CDU/CSU and FDP. While some of the leading protagonists of the Grand Coalition, including Chancellor Merkel and Vice‐Chancellor Steinmeier, might have been prepared to continue governing together, their parties had become increasingly fed up with the arrangement and hoped for a smaller coalition that would allow them to realise a larger share of their respective political goals. This left CDU/CSU with a clear and fairly likely option – namely a coalition with the FDP – while the Social Democrats could hardly claim that their preferred coalition with the Greens had a realistic chance of winning a majority. As a result, the election campaign was dominated by speculation about the possible inclusion of the FDP in a red–green government or the possible inclusion of the Left. Since any collaboration with the Left for national government had been ruled out by the SPD leadership, and the FDP ruled out any coalition with the SPD and Greens in a last minute move, the only credible coalition option on election day was a Christian–Liberal government. Arguably, this strategic constellation goes a long way to explain the disastrous result for the Social Democrats, who ended up with an all‐time low of 23 per cent. The Christian parties, however, also lost and recorded one of the worst results in their history. Clear winners were the smaller parties – above all, the FDP, which scored its best ever result of 14.6 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>Even though a Christian–Liberal coalition had been the preferred formula of both partners for many years, the coalition negotiations were rather rocky. The FDP was strongly focused on lowering taxation, while the CDU and CSU pointed to the constraints of the federal budget, which needed to deal with the massive deficit resulting from the global financial crisis. In the end, some central issues like tax reform and health care reform were shifted to commissions, it was agreed that some of the hardships of the Agenda 2010 reforms would be alleviated, and a number of short‐term measures were agreed to boost the economy. Clearly, the coalition agreement (signed on 27 October) left many conflicts unresolved, and this explains why the Christian–Liberal coalition was characterised by a conflictual style from the beginning.</p>
         
         <p>In the aftermath of the general election, the Social Democrats elected Sigmar Gabriel as new leader and the leading left‐wing politician Andrea Nahles as general secretary after SPD leader Franz Müntefering announced that he would not seek re‐election. While a leadership change in the SPD had been expected by many observers, the announcement by Left co‐leader Oskar Lafontaine that he would resign from all national leadership offices for health reasons came as a substantial surprise. The former SPD leader, who had resigned spectacularly from the Schröder Government and later became instrumental in establishing the Left in the western part of Germany, announced that he would return to Saarland to chair the parliamentary Left Party, where the first so‐called ‘Jamaica coalition’ had just been formed. This new coalition formulae, which consisted of CDU, FDP and Greens, had been discussed for several years and might lead to even more flexible coalition building in the new German five‐party system.</p>
         
         <p>The year 2009 was also marked by an important decision by the Constitutional Court setting clear limits to a gradual shift of competencies to the European Union (EU). In the future, the German Bundestag and the Bundesrat need to approve any transfer of sovereignty to the EU. Furthermore, the Court identified a range of core powers that should remain national. In June 2009, the Bundesrat finally approved an important constitutional change that limits the ability of national and Land governments to increase the public debt.</p>
         
         <p>Other important events included the re‐election of the federal president Horst Köhler in May, and the resignation of former Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung from his new position as Labour Minister because he had been ‘economical with the truth’ about a massive air raid initiated by German troops in Afghanistan that caused substantial civilian casualties.</p>
