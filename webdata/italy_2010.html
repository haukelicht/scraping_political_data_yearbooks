         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss1-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In 2010, for once, political factionalism and turmoil predominantly affected the centre‐right rather than the centre‐left. The centre‐left remained in its state of stalemate and depression fostered by the 2008 election outcome. It did not promote any initiative whatsoever to tackle the Government and it was not even able to exploit favourable conditions to score points in the regional elections. Only some minor groups made their voice heard, as in the anti‐Berlusconi rallies by the so‐called ‘purple people’, or during the student protests against university reform.</p>
         
         <p>The larger centre‐left party, the Democratic Party (<i>Partito Democratico</i>, PD), continued to lose votes and members, and reached the nadir of its electoral success in the regional elections. The newly elected leader, Pierluigi Bersani, failed to revitalise the party and thus internal rifts surfaced again. In addition, the party had to counter the blow of the resignation in January of the mayor of Bologna (a traditional leftist stronghold) and the defeat of its candidate in the centre‐left primaries for the candidacy to the mayor of Milan in November.
         </p>
         
         <p>The other centre‐left party with parliamentary representation, Italy of Values (<i>Italia dei Valori</i>, IdV), maintained an aggressive attitude <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the Government but lost political weight because, on the one hand, it was beset by internal quarrels (its first national congress, held in February, was quite divisive, and for the first time the leader, Antonio Di Pietro, found himself faced with some internal opponents) and, on the other hand, two new or newly formed partisan groups emerged and occupied its former preserve of radical opposition.
         </p>
         
         <p>One of these new partisan groups, the <i>MoVimento 5 Stelle</i> (Five Stars Movement), is not (yet) a political party. It does not have any formal organisation – its by‐laws are provocatively called ‘not a statute’– and no physical headquarters. Since it is inspired and supported by the comic star Beppe Grillo, whose blog is one of the most visited political blogs in Europe (see <span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ignazi 2007</a></span>), the official site of the Five Stars Movement coincides with the Internet address of the founder (<a href="http://www.beppegrillo.com" class="linkBehavior">http://www.beppegrillo.com</a>). Accordingly, membership recruitment consists merely of registration via the website, without paying any fee. The <i>MoVimento</i> lists obtained amazingly high scores in some electoral competitions through playing the anti‐politics card, with no exemptions for anyone. The <i>MoVimento</i> harshly criticises the established centre‐left parties for a lack of commitment. It was no surprise when it addressed, in disguised speeches, two crowded rallies in March and in October, to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, using the reference ‘No‐B Day’. The PD was left to follow suit.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second novelty in the opposition is represented by the revamping of a left‐wing radical group, Left, Ecology and Freedom (<i>Sinistra, Ecologia e Libertà</i>, SEL) which absorbed the remains of three former parties. The party leader, Nichi Vendola (see <span><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ignazi 2009</a></span>), represents an original syncretism of authentic Italian tradition (devotion to his mother and to Catholicism), postmodern lifestyle (he is gay) and political radicalism – all served with a very imaginative and brilliant rhetoric that is by far the most appealing in the present political landscape. He confirmed his political ability by again winning the nomination as the centre‐left candidate for the region Apulia in a primary competition against a PD‐sponsored candidate. He eventually went on to win re‐election at the regional election.
         </p>
         
         <p>The opposition also comprises the religious centre party Centre Democratic Union (<i>Unione Democratica di Centro</i>, UDC). The party kept its autonomous position and rarely coalesced with the centre‐left in a common opposition. However, it has not been rewarded for its moderate location on the political spectrum. Even worse, its role could be endangered by a new political foundation led by the former president of the industrialists' association – and of Fiat and Ferrari – Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, and/or by Gianfranco Fini's new party (see below).
         </p>
         
         <p>On the centre‐right, the Northern League (<i>Lega Nord</i>, LN) continued to be dominated by its longstanding leader, Umberto Bossi, whereas the main governmental party, the People of Freedom (<i>Popolo della Libertà</i>, PdL), found itself in the midst of a deep and devastating internal conflict, ending up with a split at the end of the year.
         </p>
         
         <p>The conflict within the PdL directly involved the two co‐founders of the party, Silvio Berlusconi and Gianfranco Fini, respectively former leaders of Go Italy! (<i>Forza Italia</i>, FI) and National Alliance (<i>Alleanza Nazionale</i>, AN). The conflict had been simmering under the surface for some time and involved both personality characteristics and political issues and strategy. The smiling and flamboyant tycoon Berlusconi vividly contrasted with the cold and rigid professional politician Fini. But more than that (after all, the two had continuously cooperated since late 1993), their political values and perspectives had accelerated down divergent paths in the last few years. First, Fini contested the PdL's too cosy relationship with the League, to the point of denouncing the PdL's subordination to Bossi's party. The League's principal project of ‘fiscal federalism’– in reality nothing more than more regional autonomy in tax collection and expenditures – was criticised by Fini in terms of its lack of solidarity (regarding the southern regions) and risk of disunity of the country. Second, Fini challenged the growing populist drive by Berlusconi: the attack on the magistrates, the furious partisan approach and the institutional carelessness were all criticized using liberal‐moderate references. Fini's political–ideological inspiration had become, in the last few years, more and more in tune with the European conservative parties rather than with Berlusconi's populism. In addition, Fini openly distanced himself from Berlusconi's livid polemic against the magistrates. The conflict with the judiciary depended on the many trials that the premier himself and some of his inner circle had to face – and still have to face. Many of his aides were charged with sleaze and bribery, and one of his circle from the beginning of his economic career, Marcello Dell'Utri, was sentenced in the Court of Appeal to seven years for connections with the Mafia. Third, Fini could not stand the relationship of fascination‐domination that Berlusconi was exercising upon his former party fellows.
         </p>
         
         <p>These three lines of conflict (needless to say, the third one remained behind closed doors) at last exploded in a dramatic showdown at the PdL National Executive (a large committee of almost 200 members) in April. Fini was sharply criticised for his critical intervention by Berlusconi himself, provoking an unprecedented row between the two in front of the cameras. As a consequence, Fini was dismissed from the National Executive, which was a first step towards expelling him from the party. In response, Fini promoted the organisation of a network of followers, ‘<i>Circoli Generazione Italia</i>’, which in late July transformed into an embryonic partisan organisation called ‘Future and Freedom’ (<i>Futuro e Libertà</i>, Fli). In this period, even though Fini was under constant attack from Berlusconi and his media, he supported the Government. In fact, the new party, which was launched officially in early September, voted in favour of the Government in a confidence vote on 29 September.
         </p>
         
         <p>However, the divergence between the two former PdL co‐founders was growing day after day on every issue. After a (further) sex scandal involving Berlusconi and prostitutes and under‐age girls was revealed, Fini abandoned the Government on 15 November. In principle, the number of MPs having followed Fini (35 in the lower chamber) sufficed to cause Berlusconi's resignation. However, the vote of confidence called by Fli and the other opposition parties was scheduled one month later to allow the budget to pass without incident. In the meantime, Berlusconi and his aides were able to convince – using every possible means – some MPs who had followed Fini to come back. On 14 December, the vote of confidence passed by 314 to 311 in the lower chamber. The blow to Fini has been momentous, not only because at the eleventh hour two of his former fellows changed sides, but also because his strategy of representing the centre of gravity of a new centre‐right configuration after Berlusconi had collapsed.</p>
         
         <p>The state of permanent conflict between government and opposition, and within the centre‐right, jeopardized ‘normal’ government activity. Parliament reduced its sessions to the minimum with very few days of sitting (it even took the unprecedented step of closing for almost one month before the final vote on the budget in December) and a limited legislative output. At the same time, the Government did not produce much legislation. Even on the economic front the Government failed to act in any direction whatsoever, raising a furore among industrialists too. One of the few government reforms, which concerned the university system, raised a general protest among students and professors.</p>
         
         <p>The regional elections were held in 13 out of the 20 Italian regions. Even if they did not involve the entire electorate, almost 40 million Italians were called to the polls. Participation was unexpectedly low: only 63.5 per cent voted – the lowest ever turnout for a nationwide election, with a fall of 8 percentage points in comparison to the previous regional elections in 2005.</p>
         
         <p>The elections had two winners and two losers. The winners – on one side the Northern League and on the other the Italy of Values – represent the junior partners of the pivotal parties of the respective coalitions. Both had a spectacular advance: the Lega achieved its best ever score with 12.3 per cent, doubling its votes compared to 2005; the IdV obtained 7.0 per cent, four times its previous result. By playing the xenophobic card, the Lega had not only become dominant in the North, but had also penetrated into the ‘red regions’, in Emilia‐Romagna in particular, where it picked up votes among the most disaffected and disconcerted constituency.</p>
         
         <p>The losers were the PD and the radical left. The PD continued its descent since 2008. It lost 5.9 per cent of votes but, worse still, it lost two crucial regions – Piedmont and Latium. In the latter case, the defeat was particularly damaging because the candidate – Emma Bonino – was a prominent and well known politician coming from the Radical Party, with a personal appeal spreading well beyond the party reach. In addition, the PdL party list was banned from competing in the province of Rome for having exceeded the time limit for submitting a list. All these favourable conditions were thwarted by a low‐profile campaign. The other loser was the radical left. After the debacle in 2008 when the component parties lost parliamentary representation, they were embroiled in a process of mergers and splits. At the end of this turmoil, the wing that had communist origins kept the name of ‘Communist Refoundation’ (<i>Rifondazione Comunista</i>, RC) while the other one, more postmodern and libertarian, gave birth to a party significantly called ‘Left, Ecology and Freedom’ (<i>Sinistra, Ecologia e Libertà</i>, SEL). The votes received by both parties at the regional elections numbered half their combined votes in 2005. However, SEL leader, Nichi Vendola, was able to be re‐elected as President of the Apulia region. Since this was the only visible success of the opposition in the regional elections, Vendola benefited from a positive standpoint, giving him the profile of a potential leader of the entire centre‐left.
         </p>
         
         <p>Beyond the political arena, at least two events merit discussion. One regards industrial relations. This refers not only to the relationship between labour and capital, but rather to the rift between the three main trade unions (the more leftist CGIL, the Catholic CISL and the more moderate UIL). The crucial event concerned a referendum called in one of the Fiat factories (in Pomigliano, in the south of Italy) in order to accept or refuse a penalising contract under the threat of shutting down the factory itself. This test sharply divided the leftist metalworker trade union from the other, more accommodating, trade unions. The contract was accepted by almost two‐thirds of the workers. This result was hailed as a success by everybody: by CGIL (actually by its metalworker association, which is more radical than the CGIL leadership and often in contrast with it) which received more than its traditional share of votes in that factory, and by the other two unions which succeeded in obtaining their preferred outcome. However, the workers' movement emerged weaker and divided (or, more precisely, weaker because it was divided).</p>
         
         <p>The other event is of a totally different nature and regards a television talk show. The well‐known young journalist Roberto Saviano, author of the anti‐Camorra international best seller <i>Gomorra</i>, conducted, together with a television journalist, a four‐day talk show by reading a series of texts on criminal and corruption stories that had occurred in Italy in recent decades. Around ten million people watched the broadcast: an outstanding audience for this kind of show. It demonstrated the existence of interest and attention paid to ‘politics re‐styled’.
