         <p>After the dismissal of the Pedro Santana Lopes Government by the President of the Republic Jorge Sampaio in November 2004, new legislative elections were called. Throughout January and February 2005, the main parties engaged in intensive campaigning. The opinion polls predicted an absolute majority of about 45–46 per cent and 116–119 seats for the Socialist Party under the leadership of José Sócrates, who was quite popular among the population. The Socialist Party presented itself as a unified party, keen to replace the right‐centre coalition. Sócrates was able to count on the active support of outgoing European Commissioner António Vitorino. They used a similar mobilising campaign to the elections of 1995 called the ‘New Frontiers’ by using the Internet. It was aimed at mobilising civil society for the programme of the PS.</p>
         
         <p>In contrast, the incumbent Pedro Santana Lopes presided over a divided party. Already at the beginning of January, former Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva refused to support Santana Lopes and was quite angry that his photograph was used in a poster of Social Democratic prime ministers. Prime Minister Santana Lopes had difficulty overcoming the 31–32 per cent predicted in the opinion polls. The PSD coalition partner CDS‐PP under the leadership of Paulo Portas hoped to achieve 10 per cent of the vote, but the opinion polls contradicted this target. The campaign of the Communist Party under the leadership of Jerónimo de Sousa seemed to enthuse the party's supporters. He came across as less rigid and dogmatic than previous leaders. Francisco Louçã's Block of the Left conducted a campaign emphasising left values and the need to protect the population from further austerity measures. On 4 February, an American‐style debate between the Socialist leader José Sócrates and the Social Democratic leader Pedro Santana Lopes took place, but it did not change the position of the parties in the opinion polls.</p>
         
         <p>In the elections of 20 February 2005, the Socialist Party won an absolute majority with 46.4 per cent of the vote and 121 seats. The biggest losers were the right‐centre parties that been part of the coalition government since 2002. The electorate heavily punished the PSD, which lost 11.4 per cent of the vote and 21 seats. The CDS‐PP was able to get 7.47 per cent and 12 seats, far below the target set by Paulo Portas of 10 per cent. It lost 2 seats. The communist coalition was able to halt its decline by achieving a modest increase of the vote to 7.7 per cent and 14 seats – two more than in 2002. The Block of the Left was able to more than double its share of the vote by achieving 6.5 per cent and 8 seats – an increase in its parliamentary strength of 5 seats.</p>
         
         <p>The main reason for the improvement of the left was that the right‐centre coalition government formed in 2002 under Prime Minister José Durão Barroso and later on Pedro Santana Lopes was highly unpopular and in its latter stages was perceived to be disorganised and incompetent. In terms of electoral behaviour, the high level of volatility of the electorate, which tends to switch between the two main parties, was especially notable. This electorate consisted of the new middle classes, who cast their vote instrumentally, not in ideological terms. This is one of the reasons why the programmes of the two major parties were indistinguishable from each other. Both are appealing to this centrist vote (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Jalali 2004</a></span>: 95–96).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The new government of José Sócrates</h2>
         
         <p>The new government of José Sócrates consisted of well‐qualified and experienced people who came either from industry or academic life. The most prominent figure, selected for the top job of Foreign Minister, was the <i>eminence grise</i> Diogo Freitas do Amaral. This Christian Democrat was one of the founding members of the Democratic Social Centre (Centro Democrático Social, CDS) and was a highly active politician during the revolutionary and post‐revolutionary period. He was also the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations. His independent mind throughout the 1990s led him to leave the Eurosceptic CDS. He vehemently opposed the Iraq War. Due to his membership of a Socialist government he was expelled weeks later by the European People's Party. A heavyweight of the Socialist Party is António Costa who was a member of the Guterres Governments between 1995 and 2001. He took over the Interior Ministry. José Sócrates and António Costa are representatives of the new generation in the Socialist Party, who follow very much the Third Way approach of Tony Blair, but with a distinctive Portuguese emphasis (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Magone 2005a</a></span>). Altogether, five ministers had been in the Guterres Government, including Mariano Gago, António Costa and Alberto Costa. The Sócrates Government created a balanced government of eight independents and eight members of the party.
         </p>
         
         <p>After four months, Prime Minister José Sócrates had to undertake his first reshuffle when Minister of Finance and State Reform Luis Campos e Cunha resigned after an article that was critical of the government was published in the daily newspaper <i>O Público</i>. Sócrates gave him a choice between being sacked or resigning. According to newspaper reports, Campos e Cunha was very unhappy and had already twice offered his resignation due to the lack of communication within the government. Moreover, his austerity package of measures to reduce the budget deficit was being undermined by the Socialist Party, which wanted to moderate it. It seems that he was quite annoyed that the Council of Ministers approved a decree that would force him to reduce his salary to one‐third so that he could receive his pension from the Bank of Portugal in its totality (<i>Expresso</i>, 23 July 2005). He was replaced by Fernando Teixeira dos Santos – a well‐established university economics professor from the University of Porto.

         <p>The government programme was not very different from that of the previous government. The budget deficit for 2004 was 5.2 per cent without taking into account extra receipts; including them, the previous government was able to keep it just below the threshold of 3 per cent of GDP set up by the Maastricht criteria. The new Sócrates Government negotiated with the European Commission a more long‐term approach to deal with the budget deficit, which include a package of reforms of the Portuguese economy and public administration. In spite of the new measures, the Portuguese economy continued to stagnate and unemployment rose throughout the year. One of the main objectives of the government is to reduce the number of civil servants (750, 000) by 10 per cent by the end of the legislature term.</p>
         
         <p>After the defeat of the right‐centre coalition, both the PSD and the CDS‐PP convened extraordinary party conferences to elect new leaders. The PSD elected the experienced former minister Luis Marques Mendes as the new leader of the party. Although he is uncharismatic, he was regarded as a pair of safe hands and transitional. In the CDS‐PP, José Ribeiro e Castro, who used e‐mail and telephone text messaging to prepare his campaign to the leadership, was the surprise winner (<i>Expresso</i>, 30 April 2005). Among the two other left‐wing parliamentary parties, no change of leadership took place. Both parties were boosted by the good results achieved at the legislative elections.

         <p>The local elections on 9 October 2005 were the first test for the new Socialist government. The campaign took place during September and did not deviate from the pattern of previous campaigns, which were dominated by local issues (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Veiga &amp; Veiga 2005</a></span>). Although the Socialist Party improved slightly in its overall share since the local elections of 16 December 2001, the big winner of the night was again the Social Democratic Party. The PSD won 158 councils, losing only one in comparison to 2001. In contrast, the Socialists were able to contain losses to 4 councils, in spite of a slight improvement in terms of electoral share and votes. In terms of positive gains, the Communist Party in coalition with the Greens, was able to win four more councils, thus strengthening the position of new leader Jerónimo de Sousa who seemed to contribute to a recovery of the party. Meanwhile, its rival on the left – the Block of the Left – achieved its first council victory in local elections. The independent groups of citizens were able also to make gains of four more councils and now control a total of seven.
         </p>
         
         <p>One interesting aspect of the local elections is the high number of councils changing party colours, particularly with councils going both ways between the PS and the PSD, and so keeping the net losses of both parties to a minimum. The PS won 18 new councils, 13 switched from the PSD, two from the communist coalition, two from independents and one from the Earth Party Movement. In contrast, the PSD won 13 new councils from the PS and two from the CDS‐PP. The Communist coalition and the Independents won seven councils each from the Socialists. The biggest loser was the CDS‐PP, which lost two councils and now has only one (<i>Expresso</i>, 15 October 2005). This means that the CDS‐PP is in danger of disappearing as a party at local level. (This has been a trend since the 1990s.) Moreover, the Socialists were not able to win in any of the larger urban centres – particularly Lisbon and Porto.

         <p>Presidential elections were scheduled for early 2006. Throughout the year, different candidates began to emerge. The favourite to win the elections was former prime minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva, for whom opinion polls predicted a victory of over 50 per cent in the first round. The Socialist Party was divided. Officially they supported the poet Manuel Alegre, but many militants including Prime Minister José Sócrates supported Mario Soares. This naturally reduced their chances to challenge the predominance of Cavaco Silva.</p>
