         <p>After the implementation of the austerity package imposed by the Troika between 2011 and 2014, the government of Pedro Passos Coelho faced elections in the region of Madeira in March, and general elections in October. The first ten months of the year were dominated by the election campaign. At the end of the year, a new Socialist minority government under Prime Minister Antonio Costa was formed, which relied on the parliamentary support of the Communists and the radical left. The end of the year was marked by the campaign for the presidential elections due on 24 January 2016.</p>

            <p>After 37 years in power, the president of the region of Madeira decided to resign and allow for the rejuvenation of his own party. Allegations of political corruption surrounding regional President Alberto João Jardim were widely publicised in the media and led to investigations by the state prosecutor and police. His party, the Social Democrats (<i>Partido Social democrata</i>, PSD) ruled Madeira for almost four decades with an absolute majority. The electoral polls in November and December 2014 predicted the loss of the PSD's majority, but with the party's election of new regional leader Miguel Albuquerque in December 2014, there was a possibility of a recovery. Indeed, after the votes were counted, the PSD got its absolute majority, though in fact the votes had to be counted twice because the first official declaration was that the PSD had lost its absolute majority while subsequent declarations found that there had been a computing error that did not take into account some votes from the city of Porto Santo.
            </p>
            
            <p>The second largest force was the conservative Social Democratic Centre‐People's Party (<i>Centro Democrático Social‐Partido Popular</i>, CDS‐PP), which was also the coalition partner of the PSD in central government. This clearly was regarded as a major victory for the central government, because the main challenger Socialist Party (<i>Partido Socialista</i>, PS) in a coalition with other small parties (Earth Party Movement/<i>Movimento o Partido da Terra</i>, MPT; the People–Animals–Nature Party/<i>Pessoas‐Animais‐Natureza</i>, PAN; Portuguese Labour Party/<i>Partido Trabalhista Português</i>, PTP) was not able to profit from the anti‐austerity climate of the population. The big surprise was the emergence of a new citizens’ list named ‘Together for the People’ (<i>Juntos pelo Povo</i>, JPP), which achieved representation in the municipality of Santa Cruz. JPP became the fourth largest political force in the region with 10 per cent of the vote and five seats.

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Parliamentary elections, 4 October 2015</h3>
            
            <p>The main topic of the election campaign was the impact of the austerity measures of the conservative coalition government. The government formed an electoral coalition named ‘Portugal Ahead’ (<i>Portugal á Frente</i>, PaF), which symbolised the will of the two partners, PSD and CDS‐PP, to continue to work on behalf of the country and beyond party interests. Their main slogan was ‘Portugal can do more’ (‘<i>Portugal pode mais</i>’) and emphasised continuity of government in order to complete the reform package towards a more competitive and stronger economy. Their argument was that although the Economic Adjustment Programme of the Troika (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank) had ended, the Portuguese economy was still too fragile to move towards redistribution policies advocated by the left parties PS, PCP‐PEV (Portuguese Communist Party/<i>Partido Comunista Português</i> [PCP]‐Ecologist Party ‘The Greens’/<i>Partido Ecologista ‘Os Verdes’</i> [PEV]) and the Left Bloc (BE).
            </p>
            
            <p>The main opponent of the PaF was PS under the leadership of Antonio Costa. He presented himself as the alternative to the policies of austerity of the Passos Coelho government. A crucial campaign issue was the reform of the social insurance system in Portugal, which had not been tackled by the Passos Coelho government due to lack of support by the PS. Both PAF and PS presented proposals towards cutting social insurance expenditure between half a billion and a billion euros. Both advocated ceilings, although the PaF wanted also the introduction of a voluntary private pension contribution in order to compensate for the losses.</p>
            
            <p>The opinion polls were consistent throughout the campaign period. The PaF electoral coalition would win the elections, but fail to achieve an absolute majority. The PS would not be able to improve considerably on its previous general elections result, which had reflected quite negatively on leader Antonio Costa. The PCP and BE would improve in comparison to 2011.</p>
            
            <p>The winner, but also the loser, was the electoral coalition PaF, which won 40 per cent of the vote but was unable to achieve an absolute majority as it had in 2011, falling nine seats short of the necessary 116 seats. The PS came second and can also be considered to be a loser that evening due to the fact that it was not able to capitalise on the austerity policies of the government. There was a slight improvement from 2011, but not enough to back the legitimacy of Costa's leadership. The big winner was BE under the leadership of Catarina Martins. Her tireless campaign paid off and her party became the third largest with its best results ever of 10.6 per cent and 19 seats. Mathematically, the three left‐wing parties PS, BE and PCP‐PEV had an absolute majority. The main question would be if the PS would take the leadership to move in this direction, or prefer to support the continuity of the conservative coalition. One quite negative aspect of the general elections was that abstention rose above the already high levels of 2011, and turnout therefore dropped below 56 per cent.</p>

            <p>In spite of political stability and improved economic conditions, the conservative coalition government consisting of PSD‐CDS/PP was not able to reach an absolute majority in the general elections of 4 October. This ultimately led to a minority PS government which could rely on the support of the two left‐wing parties – BE and PCP‐PEV – but the path was not a smooth or rapid one.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Passos Coelho II government</h3>
            
            <p>In the absence of an absolute majority, the PaF electoral coalition consisting of PSD and CDS‐PP began negotiations with the other parliamentary parties, particularly the PS. Several negotiation rounds took place between these three parties without leading to a concrete result. The conservative electoral coalition nevertheless decided to present a minority coalition government to President of the Republic Anibal Cavaco Silva, who swore in the new government on 30 October. It consisted of 17 members including the Prime Minister, and 36 state secretaries. Some changes were made to the previous Passos Coelho I government, but most ministers were members of either PSD or CDS‐PP, and only three were independents. On 10 November, however, the combined majority of left‐wing parties prevented this government from gaining majority support in parliament and from that point forward the Passos Coelho II cabinet had only caretaker functions until a new government could be formed.</p>

            <p>Before the rejection of the Passos Coelho II government, PS leader António Costa had already begun negotiations with PCP and BE in order to form a single‐party minority government with their parliamentary support, and he signed agreements with each on the same day as the successful motion of rejection. These were documents with a catalogue of agreed measures to reverse the austerity policies of the government intended only as a basis for securing the investiture votes in parliament.</p>

            <p>After the rejection of the Passos Coelho II government by parliament, it was up to President of the Republic Anibal Cavaco Silva to decide the next step, though his options were limited because the Portuguese Constitution prevents the dissolution of parliament during the final six months of a presidential term. Cavaco Silva engaged in several weeks of consultation with all political parties, including the Prime Minister of the caretaker government, Passos Coelho, and ultimately decided to nominate PS leader António Costa to form a government. However, in doing so, he made his offer conditional on Costa's ability to fulfil six conditions which primarily addressed concerns about financial stability and omissions the agreements between PS and the PCP‐PEV and the BE that might undermine the political stability of a PS minority government. Costa responded to these issues, and the new PS minority government was sworn in on 26 November 2015. In the ceremony investing the new government, President Cavaco Silva was quite critical of the incoming government and its potential to upset the country's still‐fragile economic situation and reaffirmed his resolve to dismiss the new government if it interfered with the country's economic stability.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the members of the new government were heavyweights of PS, which had already quite considerable government experience. Among these were Augusto Santos Silva as Minister of Foreign Affairs, José António Vieira da Silva as Minister of Social Affairs, Luis Capoulas Santos as Minister of Agriculture and João Soares (a former mayor of Lisbon and the son of PS <i>eminence grise</i>) as Minister of Culture.

         <p>After the general elections of 4 October, the new parliament convened on 23 October. Although the position of speaker of parliament has traditionally come from the strongest parliamentary party, growing tensions between left and right led to a break with past practice and the position went not to a representative of the PaF coalition, but to Socialist Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues who was able to get 120 votes. In his inaugural speech, Speaker Ferro Rodrigues criticised President Cavaco Silva for asking Pedro Passos Coelho to form a new cabinet.</p>

         <p>After three years of austerity policies, the Passos Coelho government could begin in 2015 to see the fruits of their work. The positive news was a downward trend in unemployment which fell to 12.1 per cent in July and by December had declined further to 11.8 per cent. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.5 per cent in 2015, up from 0.9 per cent growth in 2014. Between 2013 and 2014, the original public deficit figure had soared from 4.8 per cent in 2013 to 7.2 per cent in 2014 due to a €4.9 billion rescue of the Banco Espirito Santo (BES). The deficit dropped back to 4.4 per cent in 2015, but this was well above budget targets. Public debt had increased from 128.7 per cent in 2013 to 130.2 per cent in 2014, and the forecast for 2015 suggested that debt would remain at this high level. This meant that the Portuguese government would remain quite constrained in their policy‐making abilities for years to come.</p>
         
         <p>The most urgent matter for the new government was the submission of a draft budget to the European Commission. All EU Member States must submit draft budgetary plans for the upcoming year by 15 October of each year, but due to the complications following the general election, Portugal did not submit such a draft and the Costa government's Finance Minister Mário Centeno asked for an extension until beginning of January. This was granted by the European Commission due to the exceptional circumstances of the election year.</p>
         
         <p>The new government was also confronted with a banking problem inherited from the previous government. The Portuguese finance system had suffered considerably from the banking crisis. After the collapse and restructuring of BES in August 2014, the Banco Internacional do Funchal (BANIF) also faced the prospect of financial collapse. The first Passos Coelho government had set 19 December 2015 as the deadline for offers from potential buyers. Of the six offers, a majority of them wanted state aid in order to take over the ailing bank. Shortly after the offer deadline expired, BANIF was sold to the Spanish bank Totta Santander for €163 million.</p>
         
         <p>Already before the parliamentary elections, the first candidates for the presidential elections scheduled for January 2016 had begun to come forward. Originally there were 22 potential candidates, but only ten formalised their candidature at the Constitutional Court by 24 December. The favourite to win the elections was well‐known television commentator, former PSD leader and university law professor Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. All opinion polls predicted his election in the first round. Presidential elections were scheduled for 25 January 2016.</p>
