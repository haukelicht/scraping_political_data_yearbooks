         <p>In the House of Representatives the year 2011 began with the following numbers on the floor of the House: 73 for the Liberal‐National Opposition, 71 for the Labor Government, four Independents and one for the Greens. That makes 149. The 150th member was the Speaker of the House, who does not vote. Given the support pattern of the cross‐bench, the reality of that was: 75 for the Labor Government and 74 for the Liberal‐National Opposition. At the end of 2011 the following were the numbers on the floor of the House: 72 for the Labor Government, 72 for the Liberal‐National Opposition, four Independents and one for the Greens. Given the support pattern of the cross‐bench, the reality of that was: 76 for the Labor Government and 73 for the Liberal‐National Opposition. Consequent upon a further change in the office of Speaker during 2012, and the removal of a disgraced Labor member from his party, the year 2012 finished with 70 for the Labor government, 72 for Liberal‐National, six Independents, one for the Greens and one Speaker, being Labor member Anna Burke. The reality of that was still 76 for Labor and 73 for Liberal‐National.</p>
         
         <p>In other words, the House of Representatives stabilised in favour of Labor during 2012 which had the effect of ending all premature election talk. Prime Minister Gillard capitalised on this early in the new year with an unusual announcement. Speaking at lunchtime to the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, 30 January, she told the nation that the general election would be held on Saturday, 14 September 2013. However, as things turned out, the election was actually held on Saturday, 7 September 2013 – one week earlier.</p>

         <p>On Thursday, 23 February, Australians awoke to the news that former prime minister and then foreign minister Kevin Rudd would challenge his replacement as prime minister, Julia Gillard. The headlines were: ‘It's on: Rudd strikes first’ and ‘Gillard v Rudd, Part II’. At the time Rudd was in the middle of a world diplomatic tour. At 1am in Washington, DC he called a press conference at which he began by saying: ‘The truth is I feel very uncomfortable doing this from Washington and not in Australia but I don't feel that I have a choice.’ His complaint was that some Labor ministers had attacked him and Gillard had declined to repudiate them. Consequently, he resigned as foreign minister, flew straight back to Australia and, immediately upon arrival, challenged Gillard for the Labor leadership.</p>
         
         <p>The ballot was set for the morning of Monday, 27 February. The intervening weekend saw bitter recriminations and dirty tricks played by both sides but, by the time the caucus ballot came, there was not much doubt about the result. In the event, the vote was 71 for Gillard and 31 for Rudd. He moved immediately to the backbenches, pledging loyalty to Gillard's leadership. In particular he pledged never to challenge Gillard again. It should be noted, however, that opinion polls throughout the year showed Rudd preferred to Gillard by the voters. The margin was always great enough to suggest Rudd would be more likely to win an election for Labor. In the midst of all this there was a stroke of good fortune for Gillard. A Labor senator for New South Wales resigned his seat for ‘family reasons’. Very quickly the New South Wales parliament chose as replacement former premier Bob Carr, who was appointed foreign minister by Gillard. Every commentator expressed the view that Carr would make a very good foreign minister.</p>
         
         <p>The one leadership change that did take place involved the party known in Australia as ‘the Greens’. On 12 June Senator Bob Brown resigned as leader of the Greens and the ten‐person caucus elected fellow Tasmanian Senator Christine Milne as his replacement. The deputy position passed to Adam Bandt, the member of the House of Representatives for Melbourne. Late in June the Tasmanian parliament chose another Green, Peter Whish‐Wilson, to represent the seat vacated by Brown. As noted last year, the Greens differ from the other three parties in that, due to the electoral system of proportional representation for the Senate, the party is essentially a Senate party, having only one member of the House of Representatives (out of 150), but having nine of the 76 senators. The Greens' share of seats in the Senate roughly corresponds to their share of votes. Not so in the House of Representatives. Throughout this parliamentary term there have been eight Senate casual vacancies – all filled from the same party – and no by‐election for any seat in the House of Representatives.</p>
         
         <p>Late in the year there were three further ministers who announced their retirements. Rudd supporter Robert McClelland and Gillard supporter Nicola Roxon retired from cabinet and announced an intention not to re‐contest his seat (Barton, NSW) and her seat (Gellibrand, Victoria) in September 2013. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Christopher Evans from Western Australia (a Gillard supporter), also announced his retirement. Being a senator, he resigned his seat immediately. These retirements meant a cabinet reshuffle, as is set out in Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12000-tbl-0001">1</a>.

         <p>In my entry last year, referring to 2011, I wrote, on page 29:
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>The next big event occurred on 10 July. Every detail of the carbon pricing scheme was revealed, together with (in effect) a guarantee that the legislation would secure passage through both houses of parliament. The plan was for the carbon tax to apply from 1 July 2012, moving to an emissions trading scheme on 1 July 2015. The tax would be paid by about 500 big emitters. The main target would be for a 5 per cent cut in emissions by 2020 over 2000 levels. Two out of three households would have their costs fully offset, and nine out of ten would have some compensation.</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>Opposition leader Tony Abbott waged a relentless scare campaign against the Clean Energy Future package of 18 enactments, which had passed through the House of Representatives in October and the Senate in November of 2011. He continued this in 2012 with increasing shrillness, making outlandish predictions of doom and gloom at every factory he visited. This meant many people became scared when the tax actually began on 1 July. However, once in place, people became accustomed to it. An opinion poll in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> on 30 July showed the proportion of voters who thought they would be worse off had slumped dramatically. Unfortunately for Gillard, however, this did not translate into support for her government.
         
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12000-sec-0005"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12000-sec-0005-title"> Asylum seeker boats</h2>
         
         <p>As I had predicted in last year's entry, 2012 produced a record number of asylum seekers arriving by boat and a record number of deaths by drowning. However, the effect of that was to spur the politicians into action. Consequently, in June, the House of Representatives passed the Migration Legislation Amendment (the Bali Process) Bill 2012. Its purpose was to allow the government to send asylum seekers offshore to any country that was part of what was known as ‘the Bali process’. Such countries included Malaysia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea.</p>
         
         <p>The line‐up in the Senate was very unusual. Whereas Labor and the Greens normally vote together (and constitute a majority in the Senate), on this occasion the majority was a combination of Liberals, Nationals and Greens opposing Labor. In effect, it was the left and the right combined against the centre – for Labor is Australia's centre party these days. The bill was rejected by 39 votes to 29 on 28 June.</p>
         
         <p>The reaction of Prime Minister Gillard to this defeat was to announce the appointment of an expert panel to advise the government. It consisted of the former chief of the defence force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston; the former head of the foreign affairs department, Professor Michael L'Estrange; and a well‐known refugee advocate, Paris Aristotle. It reported in August and the title of its work was <span title=""><a href="#epdy12000-bib-0005" id="#epdy12000-bib-0005R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, August 2012</i></a></span>. It made 22 recommendations – all of which were accepted by the government.
         </p>
         
         <p>The upshot was that the parliament (the Labor, Liberal and National parties in the majority, with Greens dissenting) approved offshore detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, but not Malaysia. Consequently, virtually twelve months after the High Court decision (see Mackerras <span title=""><a href="#epdy12000-bib-0003%20#epdy12000-bib-0004" id="#epdy12000-bib-0003 #epdy12000-bib-0004R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>) the parliament was able to get around to saying to asylum seekers: ‘We do not want you.’ However, the actual effect of this was minimal and there is every reason to expect that the election year 2013 will be dominated by news of more boat arrivals. It will continue to be an embarrassment to the Labor Government.

         <p>There has been very little cheer for the Labor government, but one such came on 18 October when Australia won a temporary seat on the Security Council of the United Nations. When Kevin Rudd swept to office as prime minister in November 2007 one of the first things he did, early in 2008, was to announce that Australia would seek a seat for the years 2013 and 2014. The newspapers told us that Australia was part of the ‘Western European and Other’ grouping. There were three competitors for two places: Australia (population 22 million), Finland (population 5.4 million) and Luxembourg (population half a million). The experts seemed to think Finland was sure to win a place so Australia would need to battle it out with Luxembourg, which was likely to win a seat because it had been a foundation member of the UN but had never held a seat on the Security Council. In the event Finland missed out, with Australia coming in first, easily surpassing the two‐thirds vote needed (129 out of 193 in a secret ballot) and the sentimental favourite, Luxembourg, won the second seat. Australia has previously served four terms, starting in 1946, 1956, 1973 and 1985.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12000-sec-0007"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12000-sec-0007-title"> The Australian States and Territories</h2>
         
         <p>The nine Australian jurisdictions (the Commonwealth, six states and two territories) saw the third most populous state (Queensland) and both territories go to the polls in 2012. By a coincidence these are the three unicameral parliaments. At the general election in Queensland on 21 March 2009 Labor had won 51 seats, the Liberal National Party 34, and four Independents were elected. At the general election on 24 March 2012 Labor won only seven seats (a loss of 44) and the Liberal National Party 78 (a gain of 44). The number of Independents remained at four. It was the biggest landslide defeat for an Australian government in half a century and a disaster for outgoing Labor premier Anna Bligh who had succeeded to that office in September 2007. The new premier is Campbell Newman.</p>
         
         <p>Under the preferential voting system used in Australia (known as the ‘alternative vote’ in the United Kingdom), party support is usually measured in ‘two‐party preferred’ terms. At the 2009 elections in Queenland, Labor had 50.9 per cent of the two‐party preferred vote and in 2012 it secured 37.2 per cent. In 2009 the Liberal National Party had 49.1 per cent and in 2012 it won 62.8 per cent. So the swing in the two‐party preferred vote was 13.7 per cent. Due to the operation of the system Labor lost almost 90 per cent of its seats while losing ‘only’ a quarter of its vote.</p>
         
         <p>The two territories (Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory) each have fixed four‐year terms but have quite different electoral systems. In the Northern Territory the standard system of single‐member electoral districts prevails and at the general election of 9 August 2008 Labor was returned narrowly. However, on 25 August 2012 Labor was defeated, with the result being 16 for the Country Liberal Party, eight for Labor and one Independent.</p>
         
         <p>The three jurisdictions to go to the polls in 2012 all had Labor governments before election day. Having lost government in Queensland and the Northern Territory, Labor secured a consolation prize in the Australian Capital Territory. The result was eight seats each for Labor and Liberal (each with 39 per cent of the vote) and one for the Greens (with 11 per cent) in a 17‐member Legislative Assembly. This resulted in the continuation of a Labor–Green coalition government. The electoral system is single transferable vote with multi‐member electoral districts. In practice the system is semi‐proportional. It is essentially the same as the Irish system but is known in Australia as ‘Hare‐Clark’. Tasmania also employs this system for elections to its lower house.</p>

         <p>Julia Gillard and her Labor Government ended the year as badly as they had begun it. Setback after setback in state/territory elections reinforced the message of bad federal opinion polls. Virtually no pundit was willing to give Labor a serious chance to win the election in September 2013.</p>
