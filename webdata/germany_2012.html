It is exempted from the 5 per cent hurdle. The SSW does not operate on the national level, but it is unequivocally on the left and hence counted towards the opposition camp (see also Note 4). <sup>4</sup>The Bundesrat has 69 members. Regular decisions require a majority of 35 votes. If the Bundesrat rejects Bundestag legislation by a two‐thirds majority (46 votes), the Bundestag needs a two‐thirds majority to overrule this decision. Individual Länder cannot split their votes.

During the tenure of the CDU/FDP government, the rules of counting are as follows: ‘government’ camp includes single party CDU or CSU governments, CDU‐FDP and CSU‐FDP coalitions; the ‘opposition’ camp includes single party SPD governments and coalitions including SPD, Greens, Left and the SSW; and the ‘mixed’ camp includes a combination of parties from both government and opposition camps.

         <p>Plagiarised PhDs continued to be a major issue in German politics in 2012. Annette Schavan, Minister for Science and Education, who had publicly criticised her cabinet colleague Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg in the previous year (Poguntke <span title=""><a href="#epdy12011-bib-0041" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12011-bib-0041R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>), was confronted with similar allegations and her <i>alma mater</i>, the University of Düsseldorf, initiated an investigation which eventually led to her resignation from cabinet in spring 2013.
         </p> 
         <p>Foreign observers would conclude that this indicates that German politics was probably without major issues in 2012 even though the resignation of the Federal President Christian Wulff following a prolonged debate over his personal conduct clearly counts as a major event. Arguably, the turning point in this affair was his attempt to prevent Germany's leading tabloid (<i>Bild</i>) from publishing damaging details by leaving a threatening message on the voicemail of the newspaper's editor. When it became known that a criminal investigation over corruption charges had been launched, Wulff resigned on 17 February. This was widely seen as a major blow for Chancellor Merkel who had ‘lost’ the second Federal President through an early resignation. Philipp Rösler, the leader of her junior coalition partner, the FDP, shrewdly exploited this and imposed the widely popular Joachim Gauck on the Christian coalition parties as their nomination for the vacant presidency. Gauck, an East German Protestant priest and former director of the Stasi Archives (where the documents of the former East Germany (GDR) secret services are made available) had been the opposition candidate in the previous presidential election of 2010 and at that time had forced Christian Wulff to a third ballot of the Bundesversammlung, the Federal Convention that elects the President (Poguntke <span title=""><a href="#epdy12011-bib-0040" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12011-bib-0040R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Right‐wing extremism remained an important topic throughout 2012. On 13 January the Bundestag decided, with all‐party support, to constitute a committee of inquiry to examine possible failures of the security services. They had been unable to detect the right‐wing extremist background of a series of assassinations of immigrants carried out by the so‐called ‘National Socialist Underground’ (NSU) (Poguntke <span title=""><a href="#epdy12011-bib-0041" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12011-bib-0041R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). The inquiry, which was paralleled by similar investigations in several German Länder, revealed an astonishing level of incompetence within the German security services and led to a discussion about reforming the entire structure of these services. The political incarnation of right‐wing extremism, the NPD, came under heavy pressure in late 2012 when a court decided that the party must pay back €1.27 million in state subsidies because of a faulty financial report. Essentially, this means bankruptcy and the party had to dismiss all employees in the subsequent year. Even more important was the decision of the Bundesrat in December to file a case with the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the NPD. This was highly controversial because such an attempt had failed some years ago.
         </p>
         
         <p>There were several important Land elections in 2012. First, the so‐called ‘Jamaica coalition’ between the CDU, the FDP and the Greens came to an abrupt end on 6 January in Saarland. The ensuing early elections of 25 March led to the unexpected parliamentary representation of the Pirate Party, which was able to benefit from the widespread expectation that a grand coalition would be the only feasible government formula. Almost without an organisation on the ground, the party attracted a significant protest vote and polled almost 7.4 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The two early elections in May in Schleswig‐Holstein and North Rhine‐Westphalia (NRW) rescued the federal chairman of the FDP, Philipp Rösler, because his party managed to easily cross the 5 per cent hurdle. Ironically, this was due to the two strong leading candidates who were widely regarded as being critical of the federal chairman. In NRW the SPD and the Greens gained such a clear victory that the leading candidate of the CDU, Norbert Röttgen, was subsequently dismissed from federal cabinet where he had served as Minister of the Environment. Since German Chancellors normally find more subtle ways of reshuffling their cabinets, and also consult the relevant Land parties about possible successors, this was widely regarded as exceptionally cold‐blooded leadership by Chancellor Merkel. The Pirate Party won representation in both Land parliaments (polling around 8 per cent) and continued to fly high in national opinion polls, temporarily overtaking the Greens as the third largest national party. By the end of the year prolonged internal fighting had reduced their poll ratings to some 4 per cent, which indicates that there is considerable fluidity in the German electoral market.</p>
         
         <p>By the end of 2012 all major parties had positioned themselves for the national elections in the following year. For the first time the Greens elected their two top candidates by a membership referendum. It came as a considerable surprise that party chair Claudia Roth lost to the former head of the Bundestag parliamentary party Katrin Göring‐Eckardt, while it had been clear that Bundestag group chair Jürgen Trittin would be the male frontrunner. Shortly after the Greens, the CDU re‐elected Merkel as its chairperson with outstanding 97.94 per cent of the vote and only five days later, on 9 December, former SPD Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück was officially elected as the top candidate of the SPD by an extraordinary party congress with 93.45 per cent of the vote. He ‘emerged’ as the only candidate from an informal deal between three potential candidates. It is remarkable that Steinbrück held no senior party position while his contenders were party chairman Sigmar Gabriel and parliamentary leader Frank‐Walter Steinmeier. Arguably, the decisive factor was his high popularity ratings, which indicated that he might successfully challenge Chancellor Merkel. However, a series of blunders, including the revelation that he had received substantial speaker fees from publicly owned companies, quickly made him look a lot less threatening for the incumbent Chancellor.</p>
         
         <p>The euro crisis involving consecutive packages to rescue Greece and the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism (European Stability Mechanism, ESM) continued to occupy the front pages. EU matters have finally arrived at the centre stage of domestic political debates and the government coalition could consider itself lucky that most SPD and Green MPs continued to support the government as there was noticeable dissent among its own ranks. The decisions over the fiscal pact and the ESM were the most dramatic and invoked the Constitutional Court twice over a short period of time. First, on 16 June it ruled that the government had violated the rights of parliament during the ESM negotiations by not informing the Bundestag early enough. Second, the Court took its time (until September) to finally clear the way for the ESM.</p>
