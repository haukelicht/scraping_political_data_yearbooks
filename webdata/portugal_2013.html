         <p>The year 2013 was another turbulent one for Portugal as ongoing austerity measures continued to bite. The incumbent government was faced with a defeat in local elections, multiple government reshuffles and increasingly violent protests against the cuts. However, the economy did finally begin to improve in the last quarter of 2013.</p>

            <p>The local elections on 29 September 2013 were a major defeat for the conservative coalition. A total of 308 officials in municipalities were up for election, so it was an important mid‐term test for the coalition government. The big winner was the Socialist Party who, with 36.3 per cent of the vote, gained the majority of towns and parishes across the country. The two coalition government parties got abysmal results. The Social Democrats (PSD) won 16.7 per cent, and the Democratic Social Centre‐People's Party (CDS‐PP) almost collapsed, winning only 3 per cent. In some cases, the government parties formed an electoral coalition, winning them an additional 7.6 per cent. After the socialists, the communists have to be regarded as the big winners with 11.1 per cent of the vote. Meanwhile, the Left Bloc remains almost invisible at local level. Citizen groups achieved 6.9 per cent; some of these independents are former politicians who left their parties and were standing against the official candidate.</p>

         <p>The first major cabinet reshuffle was on 12 April. Two new ministers were appointed by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho. One of them was Miguel Poiares Maduro (1967 male, PSD), an internationally renowned Professor of European Law, who was one of the general‐advocates in the European Court of Justice between 2003 and 2009, professor at the prestigious European University Institute (EUI) in 2011, and quite involved in the PSD. Allegedly, his appointment was forced upon Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho by President of the European Commission José Manuel Durão Barroso. Maduro became Joint Minister of Government and Regional Development. The second appointment was Luis Marques Guedes (1957 male, PSD) who was joint junior minister to the Prime Minister. He replaced the controversial Miguel Relvas as Minister of the Presidency and Parliamentary Affairs.</p>
         
         <p>After the resignation of Vitor Gaspar, Passos Coelho appointed the junior treasury minister Maria Luis Albuquerque the new Finance Minister. This is one of the most important positions in the cabinet, and her appointment created tensions with the junior partner CDS‐PP. Albuquerque had gained a strong reputation within the government, but also in the Troika (i.e., European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank) and Brussels. The news of her appointment as Finance Minister was not only welcomed by the markets, but also by the EU institutions and the IMF.</p>
         
         <p>One of the first appointments by Albuquerque was junior treasury minister Joaquim Pais Jorge, who had previously worked in the private sector and was involved in offering insurance products to several state institutions in which the public sector lost a lot of money. He was asked about meetings with former Socialist minority government Finance Minister Teixeira Santos, but he responded that he could not remember. This led to further investigations by the press, resulting in a general call for his resignation by the media. He resigned on 7 August.</p>
         
         <p>Soon after the appointment of Albuquerque on 2 July, Foreign Minister Paulo Portas, the leader of CDS‐PP, resigned from his position, creating a crisis as detailed below. Finally, on 24 July, four new ministers of the reshuffled government were sworn in. Paulo Portas's position was upgraded to Deputy Prime Minister with the special competence of coordinating the economic policy of the government, and therefore hierarchically above the new Finance Minister. The new Foreign Minister was the experienced Rui Machete (1940 male, PSD), who had served in the sixth provisional government (1975–1976) during the transitional revolutionary period and in the ninth constitutional government (1983–1985) under the leadership of Prime Minister Mário Soares. The new Minister of Economy, replacing Alvaro Santos Pereira, was Antonio Pires de Lima (1962 male, CDS‐PP), who was a business administrator and chair of the National Council of the junior partner of CDS‐PP in 2007. The quite large ministry of Agriculture, Sea, Environment and Planning of Territory was now split into two. The existing minister, Assunção Cristas, was appointed head of the new Ministry of Agriculture and Sea, and newly appointed Jorge Moreira da Silva was placed in charge of the new Ministry of Environment, Territorial Planning and Energy. The fourth new minister was Luis Mota Soares, who took over the Ministry of Solidarity, Employment and Social Solidarity. Soares (1974 male, CDS‐PP) had built his career in the youth organisation of the CDS‐PP and is a lawyer. This reshuffle increased the size of cabinet from 13 to 15 members.</p>

         <p>Prime Minister Passos Coelho's government continued the implementation of austerity policies agreed with the Troika in the programme of economic adjustment. As in previous years, it was subject to a rigorous and strict monitoring process by the Troika, which visited Portugal every three months and met with government representatives. Portugal ended up with a budget deficit in 2012 of 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and a public debt of 125 per cent of GDP. The budget deficit was above the ceiling agreed with the Troika of 4.5 per cent, later revised to 5 per cent. Growing unemployment throughout the first half of 2013 showed that the social situation in the country was deteriorating. The number of people excluded from receiving unemployment or other social benefits increased during this period.</p>
         
         <p>Therefore, the 2013 budget introduced further austerity measures which were strongly opposed by the left‐wing opposition parties the Socialists (<i>Partido Socialista</i>, PS), the Communists–Greens (<i>Partido Comunista Português–Partido os Verdes</i>, PCP‐PEV) and the Left Bloc (<i>Bloco da Esquerda</i>, BE). The political parties asked the Constitutional Court to check the constitutionality of these measures. At the beginning of the year, President Anibal Cavaco Silva also joined the opposition parties in this exercise.
         </p>
         
         <p>The new austerity package included not only tax increases, but also cuts in pensions. Moreover, the reduction of the number of tax brackets from eight to five increased the tax burden of the population. Indirect taxes in the housing sector and insurance system further complemented the austerity package. The age of retirement for public servants increased to 65 after at least 15 years of service. There were dramatic cuts of €1.7 billion in expenditure in the national health sector. Several other measures targeted financial transactions, local government funding and the completion of several privatisations. It was projected that the government would be able to reduce the budget deficit by €2.5 billion by the end of the year through these measures.</p>
         
         <p>In early April 2013, the Constitutional Court issued a negative ruling against some of the austerity measures in the budget. The four measures included the reduced holiday bonus for civil servants, changes to teaching contracts and changes to pensioners' wages due to the violation of equality in the principle of pay between public and private sector. Moreover, a tax on unemployment and health benefits was also rejected. It was estimated that the ruling would create a €1.4 billion shortfall. This was the second negative ruling against the austerity policies of the government, with the first being issued in July 2012 (Magone <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12064-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013a</a></span>: 191). This ruling destabilised the government, particularly Finance Minister Gaspar who struggled to deal with the shortfall that was created. Therefore, on 1 July, Gaspar resigned, citing private reasons as documented in a letter leaked to the press. The letter also presented quite a bleak state of the state finances, resulting in a crisis of the Passos Coelho government. This was reinforced after Passos Coelho appointed Maria Luis Albuquerque as new Finance Minister without proper consultation with Paulo Portas, the leader of junior partner CDS‐PP and Foreign Minister. Portas decided to resign, leading to a crisis of the government. However, Passos Coelho went on the offensive and gave a speech on television refusing to accept Portas' resignation. He appealed to his junior partner to renegotiate the coalition agreement and finish the implementation of the programme of adjustment. The markets reacted negatively to the government crisis and interest rates increased considerably. After renegotiation of the coalition agreement, Portas became Deputy Prime Minister and gained more competences in economic and financial affairs, working closely with Albuquerque. Thus, the collapse of the Passos Coelho government was averted. A major reshuffle took place so the government could be better equipped to continue to implement the austerity measures package (Magone <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0012%20#epdy12064-bib-0014" id="#epdy12064-bib-0012 #epdy12064-bib-0014R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013b; 2014b</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>During this crisis, President Cavaco Silva appealed to the political parties to accept a medium‐term agreement of national salvation (<i>acordo de salvação nacional</i>). This was particularly directed at the governing social democrats, the democratic social centre and the Socialist Party. However, after a few negotiation rounds, the Socialist Party decided not to continue the talks. One of the main reasons for this rejection of further negotiations was that the approaches to the economic and sovereign debt crisis were irreconcilable.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the end, President Cavaco Silva opted for a continuation of a reshuffled conservative coalition government between PSD and CDS‐PP due to the need to send a sign of stability to the markets. He rejected the call of the opposition parties for new early elections. This was facilitated by the renegotiation of the coalition agreement by the coalition partners.</p>
         
         <p>During the summer, calls for a second bail‐out were expressed by the Socialist Party. However, the government wanted to avoid at all costs a prolongation of the monitoring of the Troika beyond the current bail‐out. The main aim was to get rid of the Troika as soon as possible by fulfilling all the requirements asked of the government. However, at the end of August, the Constitutional Court vetoed another government austerity measure: the law on civil service mobility. This also included a programme of friendly contract termination. The target was to reduce the almost 600,000 civil servants by 30,000. It was estimated that this would lead to a potential shortfall of €419 million. The markets reacted with an increase to 6.98 per cent in interest rates for ten‐year sovereign bonds (Magone <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12064-bib-0014R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014b</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>One of the first actions of Deputy Prime Minister Portas was to present a blueprint for state reform called ‘A Better State’ (<i>Um Estado Melhor</i>). This document was debated in Portugal, inviting political parties and social partners to comment on it. The three parties that endorsed the economic adjustment programme – PSD, CDS‐PP and PS – were the primary target groups for these changes. However, the Socialists were very sceptical about the government's intentions and regarded the document to be a way of justifying public sector cuts (Governo de Portugal <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0008%20#epdy12064-bib-0009" id="#epdy12064-bib-0008 #epdy12064-bib-0009R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The economic situation improved slightly in the last quarter of the year. Unemployment went down from over 17 to 14.9 per cent, exports improved considerably and the government was able to collect more taxes than envisaged. All this allowed the government to be more optimistic. In October 2013, the government was envisaging an end to Troika supervision in June 2014. In particular, European Stability Mechanism director Klaus Regling was very positive about the Portuguese case, and advised the country to have a precautionary transition programme after completion of the programme of adjustment. This transition programme would allow Portugal to get funding from the markets with a safety net. This was also advised by President Cavaco Silva, who is an eminent economist. However, the government hoped to return to the markets without such a precautionary programme (Magone <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12064-bib-0014R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014b</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In the autumn, the new budget for 2014 was presented. The government tried to get the approval of the Socialist Party in the Assembly. However, the Socialist Party opposed the new package of austerity measures, which included further deterioration of wages of civil servants and pensioners, an increase of indirect taxes including the value‐added tax, and privatisations including the national energy network (<i>Rede Energética Nacional</i>, REN). The number of civil servants affected by the measures increased considerably. Until the end of 2013, only those civil servants with wages over €1,500 would suffer major cuts between 3.5 and 10 per cent; the revised version envisaged cuts between 2.5 and 12 per cent after an income of €650, which would be progressively applied throughout the wage scale. Moreover, the reduction of the civil service by 2 per cent was also one of the major measures. Many measures were also extended to the segments of the population with lower incomes. Retired politicians were also affected by considerable cuts. State subsidies for 358 politicians were abolished, leading to an estimated saving of €758,000. Only the former Presidents of the Republic Antonio Ramalho Eanes, Mario Soares and Jorge Sampaio were excluded from the measure. It was finally approved in the Assembly on 26 November, and signed into law on 31 December by President Cavaco Silva. The left‐wing opposition parties PS, PCP and BE submitted appeals to the Constitutional Court in order to check the constitutionality of the new austerity measures.
         </p>
         
         <p>In December, the Constitutional Court responded to the appeals of the opposition parties and ruled against some of the government measures related to the 2014 budget. In particular, they rejected proposals to cut retrospectively the pensions above €1,000 of public sector workers who had already retired. This breached principles of trust and protection guaranteed by the constitution. The government therefore had to deal with a shortfall of €388 million (Magone <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12064-bib-0014R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014b</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>For the Passos Coelho government, the finances improved considerably due to an increase in tax revenue. The government was able to finish the year with a budget deficit of 4.9 per cent of GDP, still below the revised target with the Troika of 5.5 per cent. However, public debt increased from 124.1 to 129 per cent of GDP. These official figures by Eurostat came out in April 2014 (Eurostat <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0005%20#epdy12064-bib-0006" id="#epdy12064-bib-0005 #epdy12064-bib-0006R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Throughout the year, there were over 2,859 official demonstrations, about half the number of the year before. However, the nature of the demonstrations was more violent. The climax was the invasion of the Assembly of the Republic by public security officers on 21 November. Moreover, on 27 June, there was the fourth general strike since the programme of economic adjustment started being implemented. It was organised by the General Union of Workers (<i>União Geral de Trabalhadores</i>, UGT) and General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (<i>Confederação Geral de Trabalhadores Portugueses</i>, CGTP‐In). There were also radical actions such as the occupation of ministries by the CGTP‐In after the budget bill was approved by parliament. Throughout the country, representatives of the government were greeted with protests or revolutionary songs such as ‘Grandôla Vila Morena’ (the main song of the Portuguese Revolution 1974–1975). People staged protests against the government several times from audience galleries in the Assembly of the Republic (SSI <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12064-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 211).
         </p>
         
         <p>The government continued its policies of liberalisation of the labour market. On 28 June, the coalition government reduced the number of days of compensation for each year of employment when a worker is dismissed. The entitlement was cut by 40 per cent. This was the second time the government reduced the number of days to which workers are entitled for each year of employment in case of dismissal. However, several transitional rules exist for workers that have contracts initiated before the law was implemented in October 2013. There was a general deterioration in the relationship with the social partners, particularly trade union confederations. The quality of industrial relations declined considerably, particularly in terms of collective agreements, which declined sharply each year after 2011. The dialogue with the social partners became more difficult during 2013 (EIRO <span><a href="#epdy12064-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12064-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).
