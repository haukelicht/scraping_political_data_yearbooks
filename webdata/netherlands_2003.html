         <p>In the Netherlands, European Parliament (EP) elections took place on 10 June. The government urged people to vote through television spots and posters with a rather anodyne slogan: ‘Europe, Quite Important!’ (‘<i>Europa, Best belangrijk!</i>’). It may have helped a little to increase the turnout, which rose from 30 per cent in 1999 to 39 per cent in 2004. More important factors were probably an increased interest in politics, especially the politics of protest and populism, since the elections of 2002. The higher turnout may have especially benefited parties that were critical of or sceptical about the European Union (EU). Moreover, the European election campaign mixed salient European themes with domestic issues, such as the tolerant Dutch policy concerning drugs (<i>gedoogbeleid</i>) that was defended as exemplary in Europe by Democrats 66 and Green Left, but attacked by the Christian Democrats.
         </p>
         
         <p>All major Dutch parties tend to favour European integration. Most enthusiastic was Democrats 66 (D66), a staunch advocate of a federal EU. Almost equally positive was the Labour Party (PvdA, <i>Partij van de Arbeid</i>), which only regretted that the EU did not devote more attention to employment and social policy. The Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA, <i>Christen Democratisch Appèl</i>) was once the most eager federalist party in the Netherlands, but now campaigns a bit more cautiously for ‘a proper place in Europe’ (‘<i>een eigen plek in Europa</i>’). The Green Left (<i>GroenLinks</i>) was critical about the EU, but clearly federalist, as it felt environmental policies could only be effective at the European level. Least federalist of all established parties was the Liberal Party (VVD, <i>Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie</i>), which campaigned with the slogan ‘For Europe – but there are limits’ (‘<i>Voor Europa. Maar er zijn grenzen</i>’) (in Dutch, the word ‘<i>grenzen</i>’ can mean ‘limits’ as well as ‘borders’). In its view, both the geographic expansion of the EU and the expansion of supranational powers were reaching their acceptable limits. The VVD's campaign was marred by internal divisions between parliamentary leader Jozias van Aartsen and his predecessors, Hans Dijkstal and Gerrit Zalm. The latter was now Vice‐Prime Minister and Finance Minister, but was still considered the political leader by some. Dijkstal had retired from active politics and voiced strong criticism of the party's tough immigration line just a few days before the election. In addition, a day before the election, the Liberal junior Minister for Education, Annette Nijs, resigned after a series of conflicts with the (senior) Minister for Education, Maria van der Hoeven (CDA), which did not help the VVD either.
         </p>
         
         <p>All pro‐EU parties lost votes at this election, except for the PvdA. The modest gains of the Social Democrats can be explained in terms of domestic politics. The PvdA had waged its campaign mainly against the governing coalition and interpreted the elections as a defeat for the governing parties. Even so, as the largest opposition party, it lost support compared to the parliamentary elections of 2003, when it had won 27 per cent of the popular vote.</p>
         
         <p>The parties that were more critical of the EU did better at the elections, except for the Christian Union (<i>ChristenUnie</i>). This party resulted from a merger that may have been resented by some loyal supporters of the two old parties. In 1999, the two Protestant parties were still independent, but presented a common programme and common list of candidates together with a third Protestant party, the Political Reformed Party (SGP, <i>Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij</i>). At parliamentary elections in 2002 and 2003, the Christian Union did worse than its two predecessors in 1998. At the European elections in 2004, the percentage of the popular vote for Christian Union and SGP was higher than their combined vote in 2002 and 2003, but lower than their share in 1999. They would have lost another seat without the electoral alliance (<i>lijstverbinding</i>) with the CDA. The Protestant parties also may have lost voters due to the alleged financial improprieties of its MEPs, who had declared more expenses than Dutch MEPs normally would.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Socialist Party (<i>Socialistische Partij</i>, SP) increased its share of the vote compared to 1999 as well as to the parliamentary elections of 2002 and 2003. It waged a lively campaign, with the slogan ‘Send a watchdog to Brussels!’ (‘<i>stuur een waakhond naar Brussel</i>’) – visualized in a television advertisement by a small but feisty dog running towards the European Parliament buildings. Supporters of PvdA and Green Left who did not share the European enthusiasm of their parties may have switched to the SP. The Socialists objected especially to the neo‐liberal socio‐economic policies of ‘Brussels’, and also opposed the introduction of the euro. Equally critical about the EU, but for different reasons, was the List Pim Fortuyn (<i>Lijst Pim Fortuyn</i>, LPF). Fortuyn had criticised the bureaucratic nature of the EU as lacking a ‘soul’. After his violent death in 2002, however, his party was torn by almost permanent strife and power struggles. Its participation in government was generally seen as a failure. As a result, it lost two‐thirds of its seats and obtained slightly less than 6 per cent of the vote at the parliamentary elections of 2003. In 2004, it was reduced to 2.6 per cent, not enough for a seat. Many of its supporters might have voted for a new party, Transparent Europe (<i>Europa Transparant</i>, ET), founded by Paul van Buitenen. Though Van Buitenen lacked the charisma of Fortuyn, he shared with him characteristics like courage, non‐conformism, distrust of elites and a stubborn pursuit of certain ideals. ‘Whistleblower’ Van Buitenen had nearly lost his job as a European civil servant when he repeatedly criticised financial improprieties. Transparency and accountability of European institutions were his main goals. Apart from Transparent Europe, six other newcomers vied for seats, but without success. Only the Animal Rights Party (<i>Partij voor de Dieren</i>) came close, with 3.2 per cent of the vote.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Multiculturalism and immigration have been salient issues in Dutch politics since 2001. Pim Fortuyn raised them in 2001 until his violent death in May 2002. They dominated the election campaigns of 2002 and (to a somewhat lesser extent) 2003. In September 2002, the Lower House established a parliamentary committee to investigate the integration of immigrants over the last three decades, following a proposal of the SP. The Committee was led by Stef Blok (VVD), but included members of all parties. In January 2004, it published its final report entitled <i>Building Bridges</i> (<i>Bruggen bouwen</i>). Its conclusions were rather cautious: immigrants had been successfully integrated to some extent, but not without problems. Problems were caused in particular by segregation of ‘black’ and ‘white’ schools and concentration of poverty in ‘black’ urban areas, by discrimination (in the labour market especially) and lack of language training. The conclusions were criticised as too vague and even naïve by most parties in Parliament. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, herself an immigrant from Somalia and a Liberal MP since 2003, described the report as ‘really worthless’. SP‐leader Jan Marijnissen, who had initiated the investigation, was more positive.
         </p>
         
         <p>The investigation created another problem for the SP, however. In 2002 it had appointed its only immigrant MP, Moroccan‐born Ali Lazrak, as a member of the committee. Yet in September 2003, Lazrak left the committee because in his opinion it was relying too much on uncritical, ‘multiculturalist’ experts. Marijnissen did not hide his disappointment about Lazrak's departure. The conflict was compounded by Lazrak's refusal to remit his earnings as an MP to the party treasury. Like all other Socialist parliamentary candidates, he had signed a contract to this effect. The party would return to its MPs about €2,000 every month out of the more than €7,000 they received from the government (before tax). Lazrak felt this made him too dependent on Marijnissen, who (according to him) led the party and parliamentary group in an authoritarian fashion. When mediation failed, the SP expelled Lazrak in February 2004. He refused to give up his seat and continued as an independent.</p>
         
         <p>Lazrak was not the only MP to quarrel with his party about multiculturalism. Two Liberal MPs, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Geert Wilders, also felt their party was too soft on this issue. Both had to pay a price in their personal lives, as they received frequent threats from Islamic extremists. Wilders warned against Islamic extremism even before September 2001. In June 2004, he wrote a manifesto (entitled ‘<i>Recht(s) op je doel af</i>’: ‘Right on target’) together with another MP, Gert Jan Oplaat, urging the VVD to pursue a more right‐wing course. Immigrants should be forced to choose between integration or emigration. Turkey should not be admitted to the EU. Foreign aid should be reduced. Criminals should receive a life sentence after (at most) three serious offences (‘three strikes and you are out’). The leadership of the VVD did not react positively to the manifesto; especially the question of Turkish membership in the EU caused a conflict that could not be resolved. In September, Wilders left the Liberal caucus and became an independent. Hirsi Ali did not follow him. Wilders planned to organise a new political movement for ‘decent, right‐wing and social people with courage’ (‘<i>mensen met lef die fatsoenlijk, rechts en sociaal zijn</i>’). The movement would fight the ‘one‐party state’ ruled by a technocratic oligarchy and ‘give the country back to the citizens’. Wilders received some support from members of the (disintegrating) LPF and from the Edmund Burke Foundation, a conservative think‐tank founded by Liberals and Christian Democrats. Some of the founders disagreed with this and withdrew from the executive committee of the foundation.
         </p>
         
         <p>In opinion polls, Wilders’ not‐yet‐existing party at once attracted 3 per cent of the voters or enough for four seats in the Lower House in early September. In October, support increased to 6 per cent (nine seats). In the first week of November, it doubled to 12 per cent (nineteen seats). No doubt this was a reaction to the assassination of Theo van Gogh, a well‐known and controversial film‐maker, by a Muslim of Moroccan descent in the streets of Amsterdam. A few months before, Van Gogh and Hirsi Ali had made a movie dramatising the suffering of Muslim women. <i>Submission, Part I</i> included an actress in a see‐through veil telling stories about incest, violence and rape, and images of a woman with words from the Quran carved into her naked back. <i>Submission</i> was broadcast on Dutch television in August 2004. Hirsi Ali received several death threats and was put under 24‐hour police protection, but Van Gogh continued to move around Amsterdam by himself, usually by bicycle – until 2 November, when a young Muslim passed him on his bike, shot him down and slit his throat with a knife.
         </p>
         
         <p>The murder caused an enormous shock in the Netherlands. Journalists, actors and writers who had known Van Gogh published personal memories and expressed their warmest feelings – even if they had quarrelled with him during his life. Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called the film‐maker an ‘outstanding champion of free expression’ and expressed concern about the changing political climate. In a reaction typical of the Christian‐Democrats, he called for solidarity and dialogue with Muslims, most of whom, he said, were peaceful and law‐abiding. In the same vein, CDA Minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner advised Muslims to sue – rather than kill – people like Van Gogh if their religious feelings were offended. Their coalition colleagues struck a different note. Blasphemy should be legalised, rather than punished, suggested a spokesperson of Democraten ‘66 (D66). And Gerrit Zalm, Liberal Minister of Finance and Vice‐Prime Minister, described the murder as ‘a declaration of war’ and wanted to ‘declare war back on them’. To Van Aartsen, former Minister of Internal Affairs and now VVD parliamentary leader, the murder was not just a criminal act, but the beginning of a <i>jihad</i> in the Netherlands, more dangerous than anything since the Nazi occupation. Now was not the time for dialogue, he said, but for repressive action. Radical mosques should be closed and radical <i>imams</i> should be expelled.
         </p>
         
         <p>The main opposition party, Labour, agreed more with the Liberals than with the Christian Democrats. Party leader Wouter Bos pointed out that the murderer was well integrated into Dutch society, and stated that political Islam was an enemy that had to be defeated. Still, Bos agreed with the Prime Minister about the need for dialogue with the Muslim minority. The Green Left, the main champion of multiculturalism, went further than even the CDA, calling for dialogue with radical Muslim youth. Green Left leader Femke Halsema regarded the assassin as an extremist rather than as a Muslim, but even she agreed that radical <i>imams</i> should no longer be allowed into the country.
         </p>
         
         <p>Several commentators suggested Van Gogh's murder spelled the end of Dutch multiculturalism. This seems premature, but the murder intensified a debate that had been raging for some years. As a result, immigration policies were toughened: potential immigrants would have to prove competence in Dutch and knowledge about Dutch society before entering the country; a Dutch citizen who wants to marry a foreigner from outside the EU would have to earn above a certain income; and conditions for asylum seekers were becoming more stringent.</p>
         
         <p>By the end of November, support for Wilders’ party had increased to 19 per cent (28 seats) – higher, according to the polls, than CDA or VVD. However, in December, support declined, likely because threats on his life forced Wilders to hide and avoid contact with the media. Hirsi Ali shared his fate, though she had decided to stay in the VVD.</p>
         
         <p>The multiculturalists, who dominated Dutch politics and media until the end of the 1990s, were now on the defensive. Radical multiculturalism was now advocated only by Muslim intellectuals and activists like Dyad Abu Jahjah, founder of the Arab European League in Belgium and the Netherlands, who claim the right to equality and respect for Islam. They argued in favour of Islamic schools, parties and other organisations, and even for the application of Islamic law. So far, they seem to represent only a minority of the one million Dutch Muslims, but this may change in reaction to growing pressure from secular individualists.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>In 2001, the Lower House (<i>Tweede Kamer</i>) approved a constitutional amendment to introduce a binding abrogatory referendum. Constitutional amendments require a two‐thirds majority at second reading. In June 2004, the amendment was defeated in the Lower House by a majority (CDA, VVD, CU and SGP voted against it). The Interim Referendum Act, passed in 2001, allowed a consultative referendum, but would expire by 1 January 2005. A proposal (of Green Left and PvdA) to turn the interim act into a permanent act and institutionalise the consultative referendum was defeated by a similar majority. However, the Lower House did not cancel the consultative referendum on the European constitution, which it had approved in November 2003. The VVD, normally hostile to referenda, voted in favour of this exceptional referendum as a substitute for a second reading in Parliament – the Dutch way to decide on constitutional matters. The Upper House will vote on this proposal in January 2005.
         </p>
         
         <p>In November 2003, the Minister for Institutional Reform, Thom de Graaf (D66), presented the cabinet's plan for a new electoral system. It would be a mixed member proportional system with twenty multi‐member districts. The plan drew considerable criticism from advisory bodies like the Election Board (<i>Kiesraad</i>) and the Council for Public Administration (<i>Raad voor Openbaar Bestuur</i>, ROB) as well as most political parties. In the eyes of the Election Board, the new system would be too complicated for the average Dutch voter. Other critics questioned whether the new system would really narrow the (perceived) gap between representatives and voters – the main goal of the reform. The CDA could accept a mixed member system, albeit without any enthusiasm, but preferred single‐member districts. So did the PvdA, though it disagreed with the Christian Democrats about the desirable number of districts. The VVD was divided about the electoral system. At a party council held in June, its parliamentary leader Jozias van Aartsen expressed a preference for a single‐member plurality system, whereas the Vice‐Prime Minister Gerrit Zalm argued for the mixed system proposed by the cabinet and another prominent party member defended the <i>status quo</i>. The fact that Van Aartsen and Zalm were tacitly competing for the political leadership of the party may have added to the intensity of the debate. The smaller parties opposed all electoral reform, apart from D66 which was the only party to support the plan of its minister wholeheartedly. Most parties also objected to the idea that parliamentary candidates would have to choose between a nomination in a district and a position on a national party list. After several months of discussions, De Graaf agreed to a concession: candidates would not be forced to choose between the two, but could accept both. Apart from this, the minister refused to change his plan. Moreover, he insisted on implementing the electoral reform before the next elections, scheduled for 2007. A decision would not be taken before 2005, however.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the same time, De Graaf was promoting a third institutional reform of the cabinet, concerning the direct election of mayors. This was another goal his party had been pursuing since it was founded in 1966. The Dutch Constitution prescribes the appointment of mayors by the Queen (i.e., the Government). In 2002, a constitutional amendment passed both houses of Parliament that left this issue to a regular law. The amendment required a second reading, which did not take place because of the governmental crisis in October 2002. In November 2004, the Lower House voted by more than two‐thirds in favour of the amendment. The Upper House will vote in 2005.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout 2004, the proposed reform was the subject of lively public discussion. The Council for Public Administration and the Association of Dutch Municipalities (<i>Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten</i>, VNG) were very critical of the ‘hybrid proposal’. The VNG held a protest meeting in The Hague in October – very unusual for this organisation of mayors, aldermen and municipal councilors. The elected mayor might become too powerful, at the expense of the aldermen and the municipal council, the critics feared. Moreover, they objected to the authoritarian style of the minister, who deviated from the Dutch tradition of dialogue and accommodation. The Council of State (<i>Raad van State</i>), the most important advisory body in the Netherlands, which is consulted about all bills and constitutional amendments, did not reject the proposal, but did express some concern about the powers of the elected mayor. The Christian Democrats, who had always defended the appointment of mayors by the Queen, no longer opposed the proposed reform, but criticised the speed of the minister, who wanted to have all mayors elected in 2006. By way of compromise, De Graaf announced in June that he would agree to the election of some mayors in 2006 and the others in 2010. The VVD and D66 accepted the proposal. The PvdA, however, was divided. In October, the party organised a referendum among its members about the issue. Almost one‐third of them (19,000 out of 60,000) participated. Only 34 per cent voted for direct election of the mayor, whereas 64 per cent preferred election by the municipal council. When the Lower House voted on the constitutional amendment, the Social Democrats were again divided: four members voted against, the others in favour. At the end of 2004, it was still unclear how the PvdA members of the Upper House would vote. Their support was needed to obtain a two‐thirds majority for the amendment as most of the smaller parties would vote against it. The Christian Union and the SGP strongly favoured appointment of the mayor, while the Green Left and the SP preferred election by the municipal council.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, municipalities practiced different procedures to select a mayor. In most cases, the municipal council would present a shortlist to the government. Yet in some towns, citizens were allowed to vote for one out of two candidates in what was formally defined as a ‘consultative referendum’. In fact, the outcome was generally accepted by the authorities.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, there was also discussion of changes to party funding. Every party represented in the Dutch parliament is entitled to a government subsidy, proportional to its number of seats. In October 2004, the Minister of Home Affairs, Johan Remkes (VVD), proposed a new funding scheme that would take into account not only the number of seats in parliament, but also the number of (dues‐paying) party members. His bill is to be discussed in 2005. Remkes also wanted to raise the total amount of subsidies to €15 million.</p>
