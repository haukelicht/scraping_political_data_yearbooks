         <p>The only changes in the cabinet occurred within the SP.a faction in the federal government, when the Flemish Socialist Party president Steve Stevaert decided to become the governor of the province of Limburg (announced on 25 May 2005). The party rapidly decided that he would be succeeded, after the parliamentary recess, by federal Deputy Prime Minister Johan Vande Lanotte. As only candidate, Vande Lanotte was elected with 93.4 per cent of the votes at a party congress on 15 October. He was replaced as federal Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Budget by the 30 year‐old Freya Van den Bossche, the federal Minister of Employment. Her former portfolio was added to that of the Secretary of State for Computerisation of the State, Peter Van Velthoven, who was promoted to the rank of minister. Vande Lannotte's portfolio of Public Enterprise was given (as a secretariat of state) to a non‐party member,<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> Bruno Tuybens, a member of the international board of Amnesty International and an ‘ethical’ banker. This musical chairs operation did not affect the distribution of portfolios among coalition parties.
         </p>
         
         <p>Regarding shifts in parliamentary strength, just two federal MPs left their party (for reasons, see below): VLD Senator Hugo Coveliers and FN Senator Detraux both became ‘independent’ senators.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The year 2005 was relatively quiet in terms of new policy issues. The most contentious issue of 2004, the splitting of the electoral constituency of Brussels‐Halle‐Vilvoorde (BHV, see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Rihoux et al. 2005</a></span>) was removed from the political agenda by a non‐decision. For months, top ministers and party leaders met in different fora and even came close to an agreement. This compromise was vetoed in the end by the post‐nationalist SPIRIT, one of the two successor parties of the <i>Volksunie</i>, which participates in the federal government as a cartel partner of the Flemish socialists. The day after (12 May), the government won a vote of confidence in the House without any dissidents among majority MPs. The non‐decision put the Flemish government, which had put the issue on the agenda in 2004 and called for an ‘immediate’ solution, into a crisis as the francophone parties, which did not ask for any change of the BHV statute, welcomed the non‐decision as a victory. The splitting of BHV was in fact a promise made by the Flemish Christian‐Democrats to induce their Flemish‐nationalist cartel partner, N‐VA, to join the Flemish government in 2004. The N‐VA withdrew its protests after the Flemish government took some unilateral measures to reinforce Flemish presence in the BHV constituency. After weeks, the Flemish government also regained parliamentary confidence in the Flemish parliament by a simple majority versus opposition vote.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another issue with strong community conflict was also put on hold: the issue of airplane noise around the national airport in Zaventem (situated in Flanders, but very close to the capital). After several successive plans to spread the night flights above Brussels' periphery, and after many judicial appeals, the dispute was not settled. The Brussels executive managed to have its stringent noise norms upheld in court, but agreed not to use the high fines it could impose on every night flight over the capital until an overall agreement among the concerned executives (the Flemish, Brussels and federal governments) was found. This agreement is expected by 2008.</p>
         
         <p>Other community issues included the decision of the Flemish Minister for Housing to make knowledge of Dutch a condition to obtain social housing, which was seen by the francophones as a measure to exclude French‐speaking citizens from social housing in the Brussels periphery. In November, a group of influential members of the Flemish economic elite published the ‘Warande manifesto’ calling for a split of the country, as regions are supposed to drift further apart and Wallonia is living on the back of subsidies from Flanders. The Flemish Prime Minister also voiced such opinions.<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a> It may come as no surprise that the festivities for the 175th birthday of Belgium and the 25th of federalism were marked by rather lukewarm celebrations in Flanders, and celebrated much more enthusiastically by the francophones.
         </p>
         
         <p>In terms of socio‐economic policies, the government managed in January to conclude a national labour convention between trade unions and employers, but in autumn it followed a collision course with the former regarding the reform of the ‘end of career’ system, the so‐called ‘Generation Pact’. As only 22 per cent of Belgians between the ages of 55–65 are still professionally active (against an EU‐15 average of 36 per cent), the government has been planning since its formation in 2003 to put the question of working longer on the agenda of the social partners. The main issue was reducing the possibility of taking a pension before the legal age of 65. After the parliamentary recess, discussion resumed, but soon the socialist trade union called for a general strike (on 7 October), the seventh one in the country's social history. The strike was a success in terms of bringing the economy to a halt, but the government, including the socialist parties, did not budge. This success also put the main (Christian) trade union under pressure, and it decided two weeks later to join another call of the socialist trade union for strikes, but this time by region and sector, to be held in the first week of December. The actions ended when the government agreed to take the unions' position into consideration when discussing the implementation of the Generation Pact measure for specific categories of workers. The pact further widened the confidence gap between socialist trade unionists and socialist ministers, as the latter stood by the government's plans.</p>
         
         <p>Relations between the socialists and liberals underwent serious tensions as the former felt that a number of measures envisaged by the latter were decidedly ‘too liberal’ (e.g., a proposal of Guy Verhofstadt to increase the level of VAT). It was even expected that the PS would provoke the end of the government in the autumn. In August, as oil prices continued to rise, Verhofstadt and Reynders, respectively Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister but both from the liberal party family in the federal coalition, announced to the media that they intended to issue a fuel‐check to relieve citizens from part of the financial burden of house heating in the winter. As this idea had not been discussed in government, it did not have the consent of the socialist part of the government. The latter felt betrayed by their partners because with this type of measure the liberals quite clearly wanted to seduce the lower income population, the core electorate of the socialists.</p>
         
         <p>Regarding EU issues, all opposition parties and some majority parties called for a referendum on the EU Constitution. The call failed as the strongest proponent for direct democracy, SPIRIT, finally withdrew its support in February 2005 after the Vlaams Belang launched a campaign ‘Turkey to Turks, Europe to Europeans’ and hence would pervert the real issue. The Council of State, which is the government's advisor on proposed laws, also issued advice against holding a referendum, arguing that the Constitution specifies that Belgium is a representative democracy and that its representatives should not be constrained by an imperative mandate. Some parties also recalled the precedent of the popular consultation on the return of the king in 1950, which revealed the importance of the community cleavage (Flanders had largely voted in favour, Brussels and Wallonia against, but given population strengths, the national result was positive). Hence, the instrument for ratification finally chosen was parliamentary assent, which meant that a positive vote was needed in no less than nine assemblies as the constitutional treaty was considered a ‘mixed treaty’ (with implications for the powers of both the federal state and the regions), in order for the text to be ratified.</p>
         
         <p>The information campaign and debates promised in compensation for the absence of a referendum were quite disappointing, and the first parliamentary debates took place in almost empty arenas. The Senate (28 April) and the Chamber of Representatives (19 May) were the first assemblies to vote on the treaty, shortly before the French referendum, with only the extreme‐right parties voting against the text. Even though the Prime Minister asked all the other assemblies to put this issue on their agenda as quickly as they could, the Flemish parliament decided to slow down the process, arguing that the federal level could not dictate its work (all the other assemblies had voted on the text by the end of July). First, there was another attempt to let citizens express themselves on the treaty, but this time through the organization of regional consultation in Flanders only (a proposal emanated from the nationalist N‐VA, part of the government coalition). Second, a popular petition originating from former socialist and trade union leaders also asked for the holding of a regional consultation. Although none of these requests were adopted, Flemish politicians nonetheless further lengthened the ratification process by conditioning the organization of the vote in the Flemish parliament on the signing of a cooperation agreement between the federal and other regional parliaments on oversight of the application of the subsidiarity principle (Declaration 49 of the Treaty). In December, an agreement was signed between the chairmen of all parliaments (with a complex scheme of division of votes between federal and federated assemblies, distinguishing linguistic groups between the latter), but at the end of the year the Flemish parliament had not yet adopted the treaty and thus the ratification process of the constitutional treaty by Belgian authorities was not yet completed.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, in the values debate, the House approved in December a private member bill permitting adoptions by homosexual couples.</p>
         
         <p>Generally, the federal government did not present a good face in 2005, with the exceptions of the Minister of Justice (who launched an ambitious ‘Themisplan’ to modernize the judiciary), the Minister of Budget (who for the sixth time managed to present a balanced budget) and the Minister of Health (who started getting expenditures under control). The others were mainly invisible, or worse, blundered regularly.</p>
         
         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> Issues in regional politics</h3>
            
            <p>In Belgium, most issues in regional politics have federal connotations and repercussions and vice versa (see above). At the end of February, a French‐speaking liberal MP published a book on the disastrous state of the Walloon economy, placing the political responsibility on the socialists (PS) who have been leading the region for the last 20 years (except the 1985–1987 period). Three months later, Elio Di Rupo, president of the PS, replied by launching the idea of a ‘Marshall Plan’ for economic recovery in Wallonia with a budget of €1 billion to be presented at the opening of the new parliamentary session. However, in September, a series of scandals involving the PS in the governance of social housing agencies in its main stronghold (the province of Hainaut, mainly in and around the city of Charleroi, where the PS has an absolute majority in most of the local governments) were revealed – by another French‐speaking liberal MP. Local aldermen abused their powers in these agencies with public money destined mainly for the less affluent classes of the population, which represent also the core electorate of the PS. These aldermen eventually resigned or were removed (as some did not acknowledge the facts), but this scandal in the social housing agencies deeply affected the socialists as it actually exemplified the kinds of negative aspects of the dominance of the PS over Walloon politics usually voiced by the opposition in Wallonia and by (almost) all parties in Flanders. As these affairs mainly concerned Charleroi, the city where the socialist Minister‐President of the Walloon Region was mayor before 2000 and where he was still a political leader, Jean‐Claude Van Cauwenberghe decided to resign from his Walloon minister‐presidency in late September and was replaced by Elio Di Rupo, PS president, who in 1999 had already combined his party mandate and the minister‐presidency of Wallonia.</p>
            
            <p>Even though the initial reactions of both employers and trade unions towards the Marshall Plan were quite positive, another problem soon arose for the new Minister‐President of Wallonia. In November the government found out that a clause of the convention between the Walloon Region and Bernie Ecclestone for the organization of the Belgian Formula One Grand Prix in Francorchamps (in Wallonia), signed by the previous government in 2003, was highly problematic as it specified financial penalties in the case of cancellation of the Grand Prix in the 2006–2010 period (€14 million for each Grand Prix cancelled). At the time, the government already had to find €15 million to cover the deficits of the Grands Prix that took place in 2004 and 2005 but were not a public success, and, as more expenses were forecast for costly infrastructure adaptations to upgrade the safety standards of the racing circuit for future Grands Prix, the Walloon authorities were considering the option of canceling the organization of the race for a few years in order to save public money. With the clause of the contract ‘discovered’ in November 2005, canceling the Grands Prix would have cost more than organizing them and covering potential deficits. None of the democratic parties gained from the situation, as the socialists, the liberals (MR) and the greens (ECOLO) were in coalition at the time of the signing of the convention and the Christian Democrats (CDH) were now in government with the socialists. At the end of the year, negotiations were still under way with Bernie Ecclestone.</p>
            
            <p>In terms of institutional reforms, one should mention the new Walloon Local Democracy Code. It stipulates a ‘quasi‐direct’ election of mayors: the mayor will automatically be the candidate of the largest party of the coalition (if any) with the largest number of personal votes. If he or she refuses to become mayor, they cannot be part of the local government at all, and the candidate of the largest party of the coalition with the second largest number of personal votes becomes mayor. Furthermore, a constructive vote of no confidence was also instituted at the local government level. Even though projects of the kind were also discussed in Flanders and in the Brussels‐Capital Region, they were only enacted and thus will be applicable at the 2006 local elections in Wallonia.</p>

            <p>Apart from the musical chairs triggered by the promotion of party leader Stevaert to be governor of Limburg (due to health reasons), the SP.a did not undergo any serious internal changes, aside from the discontent of socialist trade unionists with the government plans for reforming the pension age and schemes (see above). Also the Christian Democrats experienced a calm internal year with the party's real leader,<a href="#en3" class="scrollableLink"><sup>3</sup></a> Flemish Prime Minister Yves Leterme, leading firmly in the popularity polls.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the party of the federal Prime Minister, the VLD, the <i>annus horribilis</i> of 2004 continued with internal strife between the party in government and the party on the ground, and continuously bad scores in the polls (becoming Flanders' fourth party, after having won the federal elections of 2003). Discontent with the liberal‐socialist coalition was fuelled by Senator Hugo Coveliers, who was kicked out of the party on 24 January and decided to sit in the Senate as an independent. Later, on 23 November, he founded a new party, VLOTT, seeking to attract disaffected liberals and ‘respectable’ members of the Vlaams Belang. The other main critic was political newcomer and national judo coach Jean‐Marie Dedecker, senator and quite successful challenger in the party president election in 2004 (38 per cent). He continued to criticize the ‘left’ course of the federal coalition, the ‘<i>cordon sanitaire</i>’<a href="#en4" class="scrollableLink"><sup>4</sup></a> around the Vlaams Belang, and sought with populist proposals to seduce Vlaams Belang voters.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Vlaams Belang focused on consolidating its transformation from its previous form, the Vlaams Blok, a party that was condemned by the courts for racism. It became more careful in voicing its xenophobic positions especially as the House passed a law that would make it possible (effective after 13 October) to cut temporarily public subsidies to racist and negationist parties. In fact, most democratic parties started at the end of 2005 the procedure to cut VB subsidies on the basis of xenophobic declarations by party strong man Philip Dewinter made in 2005. The party managed to exploit the riots in France and the issue of Turkey's accession to the EU, and focused mostly on winning the local elections to take place in October 2006 and forcing its entry into many local executives, thus finally managing to break the <i>cordon sanitaire</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, the Flemish Greens focused on regaining some ground after the disastrous general elections of 2003 (when AGALEV lost all its MPs) and on consolidating the new generation of leaders succeeding the founding mothers/fathers of the 1980s.</p>
            
            <p>The year 2005 was an <i>annus horribilis</i> for the PS; after the Simonis and Arena affairs in 2004 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Rihoux et al. 2005</a></span>: 964), which involved two symbols of the renovation of the party (young, female, without any political mandate before they were chosen respectively as President of the Parliament and Minister‐President of the government of the French‐speaking Community; the former resigned, the latter remained in power), the ‘old guard’ was in the limelight in 2005. The most important scandal involved the PS in the sector of social housing in Wallonia (see above), but already in March Anne‐Marie Lizin, President of the Senate and mayor of a medium‐sized town wrote a letter to a judge asking her to review a case involving one of Lizin's fellow citizens. This violation of the separation of powers between the judiciary and the others (Lizin is both head of a federal legislative body and head of the local executive) was heavily criticized by the opposition, which urged her to resign, but inside of the PS only the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice clearly denounced this clientelist act.
            </p>
            
            <p>A month later Lizin, who simply apologized to the Senate for her behaviour, was again under heavy criticism: she considered the result of a local popular consultation in her commune to be positive even though 95 per cent voted against the project put to the vote by the mayor. According to her, as only 25 per cent of the population participated in the consultation, roughly 75 per cent of the population endorsed her project. The President of the Walloon Parliament also shocked thousands of people celebrating the Walloon feasts when in a public speech he downplayed the affairs in the social housing sector involving public officials of his party by saying that all citizens are entitled to, and do, commit fraud. All these affairs (the most important one being the social housing scandal, which continued into 2006) led the president of the PS in October to call for substantial amendments of the PS internal statutes. An internal audit committee was created in order to oversee the respect of the law, of the party's statutes and ethical code of conduct by every PS member holding a public mandate or a mandate in agencies in which public authorities are influential. This committee will be entitled to remove a member in case of infraction. Second, a Delegate‐General for Renewal was appointed in order to implement the renovation plan of the national party organization in terms of openness, participation and transparency, in the federations and local sections of the party. These reforms were not quite cheered by some federations and local sections where most activists still belong to the ‘old political culture’. The president of the PS, who is also the Minister‐President of the Walloon Region, also took the opportunity of the party's internal affairs to tighten further the government's Local Democracy Code by reducing the possibilities of combining multiple paid public mandates and even establishing stronger control of both the public and private emoluments of local officials. By the end of the year, opinion polls showed that the PS was under 30 per cent of vote intentions in Wallonia (they had reached 36.9 per cent at the 2004 regional elections).</p>
            
            <p>ECOLO, the French‐speaking Greens who had signed a ‘<i>pôle des gauches</i>’ manifesto with the PS before the 2003 elections (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Rihoux et al. 2004</a></span>: 956), decided in a General Assembly that the socialists would not be their privileged partner anymore and thus that they would consider entering coalitions without them. In 2003 and 2004, the PS decided, despite the common manifesto, not to include the Greens in the federal and in most of the regional governments (except Brussels).
            </p>
            
            <p>Although returning to power proved sometimes (see below) to be problematic in terms of relations between the ministers and the president of the party who managed to put an end to the Christian Democrats' sojourn in opposition (1999–2004), the CDH gained ground in opinion polls throughout the year. An open clash between a minister and party president Milquet over the export to Tanzania of machines producing ammunition by a Walloon company occurred in the beginning of 2005. The minister accepted the delivery, arguing that refusing it would have a tremendous negative impact for the company (and its workers). The president of the CDH opposed it for ethical reasons. Eventually, despite the lobbying of government ministers (including the CDH one who was in charge of the matter) of the sub‐region where the company comes from, the license to export was not awarded.</p>
            
            <p>The extreme‐right Front National was under heavy pressure when in the beginning of 2005 a public television show revealed various political, professional, financial and judicial affairs involving members of the party and/or its president, Daniel Féret. The autocratic leadership of Féret continued to be criticized by challengers, who as before were kicked out of the party. In fact, in May, one of the two FN senators decided to sit as a member of a new party called ‘Force Nationale’. The split of the FN parliamentary group implied the end of its recognition as a group and thus of its financing by the Senate. Despite these internal struggles and inability to organize at the local level, the FN was expected to catch many protest votes at the 2006 local elections following the scandals involving the dominant party in Wallonia (PS). Already in the beginning of 2005 it had managed to surpass the Greens in opinion polls.</p>
            
            <p>To conclude, 2005 was a relatively calm year in Belgian politics, but also a wasted one in terms of firm and courageous decisions. The indecisiveness of the federal government was to be expected as coalition formation talks were extremely difficult, even hostile, in spite of the fact that all four parties gained in the 2003 elections. Many factors contributed to this deadlock: the omnipotent position of the PS in the francophone party system, the victory of the Flemish Christian Democrats in the regional elections of 2004, the leadership crisis within the Prime Minister's party and its dive in the polls, the continuous growth of the Vlaams Belang (and more timidly also of the Front National) and more generally the ‘counternatural’<a href="#en5" class="scrollableLink"><sup>5</sup></a> nature of a coalition between Social Democrats and economically conservative liberals.
