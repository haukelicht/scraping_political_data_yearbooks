         <p>A month after winning the general election, the leader of the Popular Party (PP), Mariano Rajoy, was elected prime minister and named his first government (see Delgado &amp; Nieto <span><a href="#epdy12031-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12031-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). The economic crisis pushed the government to legislate for structural reforms in order to increase the competitiveness of the Spanish economy. The economic crisis also had a destabilising effect within some regions, exacerbating existing centrifugal trends, which were motivated by a refusal of richer regions to share the burden with poorer ones. In Catalonia, the region's leader, Artur Mas, succeeded in implementing the plans of his party, Convergencia i Unió (CiU), and its ally, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), to hold a referendum in 2014. To do this, however, they will have to overcome both the barrier of the Spanish constitution, which does not permit such a move, and the barrier of the central government in Madrid, which appears to be determined to prevent it.
         </p>
         
         <p>During the year the government, through the PP parliamentary group, reached an important agreement with the Socialist Party (PSOE) parliamentary group to release the hold on the renewal of key political appointments, some of which had long since expired. The agreement resulted in new appointments to the General Public Prosecutor, the Presidency of Public Television and the Presidency of the State Council.</p>
         
         <p>Five regional elections occurred during 2012, four of them in regions whose presidents have the legal privilege since its origins to convoke elections with fewer legal limitations than in other regions. The causes, dates and outcomes of these elections were quite varied. Two of the elections occurred in March (Andalucía and Asturias), two others in October (Galicia and País Vasco) and one in November (Cataluña). In all cases, except in Andalucía, the four parliaments were dissolved prematurely, though for different reasons. Two of the dissolutions occurred only five months before regularly scheduled elections (Galicia and País Vasco), while the two others occurred quite early: less than a year after the previous election in Asturias and in the middle of the parliamentary term in Cataluña. In comparison with the results of the previous elections, turnout dropped by about 10 per cent in Andalucía, Asturias and Galicia, remained stable in País Vasco and rose by 10 per cent in Cataluña. The PP won the most votes and seats in Andalucía, but the PSOE remained in government due to parliamentary support and a coalition agreement with the United Left. In Galicia, the Popular Party won in terms of the number of votes and number of seats, and used its absolute majority to remain in the government. In País Vasco, the three main parties lost votes and seats, but the main loser was the PSOE, which was replaced in government by the Basque National Party (PNV). The right‐wing nationalist PNV, which led an unbroken string of minority governments between the first regional elections 1980 and its displacement by the Socialists in 2009, lost a small share of seats but took advantage of the PSOE and PP losses to again form a minority government. The second largest share of votes and seats went to Bildu, the political arm of the terrorist group ETA that was allowed to participate in these elections when ETA announced the cessation of violent activity. In Cataluña, the centre‐right nationalist party in government, the CiU, lost 10 per cent of seats and remained in government only with the support of the radical left‐wing nationalist ERC. In Asturias, the president of a PP minority government dissolved parliament less than a year after elections because he did not have enough parliamentary support to approve the regional budget, and PP lost the presidency to PSOE by a narrow margin. Across these five regional elections, three regions confirmed their presidents while two others opted for new leaders.</p>
         
         <p>Inside the political arena at least two party events merit attention. One concerns the loss of local, regional and national elections by the Socialists in 2011. The results had internal consequences for the party. It convoked its XXXVIII Federal Congress on February 2012 to elect a new general secretary. Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, a senior socialist minister with the González and Zapatero governments, won by a margin of 22 votes over a younger female Catalan deputy Carme Chacón, also a former minister in Zapatero cabinets. Some days after the Socialist Congress, the Popular Party held its XVII National Congress. In clear contrast to that of the Socialists, the Popular meeting did not have internal problems in terms of leaders or programmes, but there was not a euphoric political atmosphere because of the important and difficult tasks facing the government.</p>
         
         <p>During 2012 the Spanish economy continued its experience of prolonged recession. The crash in the housing market and persistent domestic structural weaknesses, especially in the labour market, have been compounded by the European debt crisis. Deleveraging in the private sector has resulted in a contraction of domestic demand, adding to mass unemployment and generating high government deficits. Moreover, the inflation rate accelerated markedly in the second half of the year due to the rise in energy prices and the increase in the value‐added tax (VAT) rate. The economy contracted due to lower public and private consumption and investment. Private consumption maintained its recessive trend given the reversal of the spending boom in advance of the September rise in VAT and the deterioration of the labour market. Within a context of general weakness, economic indicators pointed to a slight improvement at the end of the year. After the rebound in inflation at the beginning of the summer due to a rise in oil prices, the increase in VAT and other tax measures, the variation in the Consumer Price Index showed a considerable reduction. This sharp drop in inflation was due mainly to energy products, car prices and some services such as tourism and telephone services.</p>
         
         <p>The labour market continued its slide, with drops in the membership of the social security programme and a continued rise in registered unemployment. The unemployment rate rose to 24 per cent, but above 50 per cent among the youth. Moreover, the adjustment of residential housing construction was well advanced, as housing starts to fall by 90 per cent from its 2007 level, while the number of finished houses dropped by about 80 per cent. The share of housing investment fell from 13 to 6 per cent, reaching a historic low, although it was still higher than in many OECD economies. Export performance has been relatively strong and unit labour costs continued to fall on the back of sharp productivity gains. These gains were mainly explained by cuts in low‐productivity jobs, mostly temporary and construction sector jobs, and further gains will depend on the ability to find new sources of productivity growth.</p>
         
         <p>Accordingly, the general government deficit of 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 overshot the original target agreed with the EU by 3.4 percentage points. This figure includes 0.5 per cent of expenditure, reflecting financial support to banks that can be considered of a one‐off nature. The overrun occurred mostly due to weaker revenue than expected, whereas the consolidation commitments undertaken in 2010, which focused on spending reductions, were largely kept. Non‐interest government spending fell significantly. Most of the deviation from the target occurred at the regional government level, in part because regional governments were hit by falling revenues from housing transactions, which fully accrue to them, and because of the rigidity of education and health spending, which account for a large share of their budgets. To some extent, the sensitivity of tax revenues to domestic demand reflected the characteristics of the tax structure, with higher VAT rates applying to consumer durables, the sales of which have fallen particularly strongly.</p>
         
         <p>The feedback loops between confidence in government solvency and banking sector health, which reflect in part the absence of appropriate eurozone institutions (OECD <span><a href="#epdy12031-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12031-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>) have resulted in high risk spreads on interest rates for government debt. Against this adverse backdrop, the immediate policy priority has been to restore confidence in the banking sector by rapidly recapitalising viable banks with capital shortfalls, resolving orderly non‐viable banks and isolating doubtful assets into an asset management company. This has been done as foreseen in the memorandum of understanding agreed between the Spanish and the European authorities in the context of the requested external financial assistance for the recapitalisation of financial institutions. Moreover, the government implemented a wide‐ranging programme, including substantial budgetary consolidation and the reinforcement of budgetary rules.
         </p>
         
         <p>The government asked for an independent detailed stress test on the whole portfolio of individual banks, which was conducted between June and September 2012. The stress testing exercise was comprehensive and took into account detailed information of balance sheets and loan portfolios of individual banks. It was carried out under the supervision of European Union institutions (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority) and the International Monetary Fund, and provided a solid assessment of the capital needs. Under this adverse scenario, seven banking groups representing 38 per cent of the banking sector needed €53.8 billion (5 per cent of GDP) more capital, and the government used the loan of up to €100 billion (9.5 per cent of GDP) granted by eurozone governments to recapitalise Spanish banks.</p>
         
         <p>These reforms have the potential to generate significant improvements in economic performance. Beyond these immediate needs, the path to recovery has been launched but further structural reforms will be required to restore confidence in the financial sector, redress public finances, bring down high unemployment and raise productivity performance, improve competitiveness, and reduce risks of poverty and social exclusion, notably among the young.</p>
