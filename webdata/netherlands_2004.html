         <p>In November 2003, the lower house (<i>Tweede Kamer</i>) approved a private members’ bill to hold a consultative referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty. The government was divided about the bill: the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA, <i>Christen Democratisch Appèl</i>) opposed it, the Democrats (D66, <i>Democraten 66</i>) favoured it and the Liberal Party (VVD, <i>Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie</i>) was divided but voted for the bill in the end. The upper house (<i>Eerste Kamer</i>) approved the bill in January 2005. The bill provided for an Independent Referendum Commission, which was appointed by parliament in February. In consultation with the Minister of Home Affairs, the Commission set the date for the vote: 1 June. It also prepared a summary of the Treaty and distributed subsidies totalling about €1 million to campaign groups (proponents and opponents as well as neutral groups).
         </p>
         
         <p>Given the inexperience of the Dutch with national referenda (the last one was held in 1798), the process was very much a matter of ‘learning by doing’. The government initially wanted to stay out of the campaign, yet decided in May to intervene in favour of the Treaty. Several ministers defended the Treaty, but often in a rather negative way – warning of the dire consequences of a ‘No’ vote – which may have backfired. The three government parties and two opposition parties, the Labour Party (PvdA, <i>Partij van de Arbeid</i>) and the Green Left (GL, <i>GroenLinks</i>), supported the Treaty, but failed to agree on a common campaign. All of them had to cope with dissident party members – quite prominent members in the case of the PvdA. The ‘No’ camp was also far from united, but less affected by dissidents in their midst. Practically all opponents regarded the Treaty as a step towards a European ‘superstate’, a bureaucratic monster that would do away with Dutch independence. In the eyes of the Socialist Party (SP, <i>Socialistische Partij</i>), the superstate would also be neo‐liberal and militaristic. The two Protestant parties, the Christian Union (<i>ChristenUnie</i>) and the Calvinist Political Reformed Party (SGP, <i>Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij</i>), were also concerned about Dutch independence, but criticized especially the reference to humanist traditions in the Treaty and its failure to recognize the ‘Judeo‐Christian heritage’ of Europe. Geert Wilders, a member of the lower house who left the Liberal Party in 2004 after a clash over the admission of Turkey to the EU, now linked this issue to the Treaty in his campaign. Because of threats from Muslim extremists, he campaigned under heavy security in a bus tour across the country.
         </p>
         
         <p>The campaign was successful in terms of turnout: 63.3 per cent of the eligible voters went to the polls on 1 June. The result, however, shocked the political elite, which overwhelmingly favoured the Treaty: 61.5 per cent voted ‘Nee’ (‘No’). Not only supporters of the parties opposing the Treaty voted against it, so did most supporters of PvdA and Green Left as well as substantial minorities of CDA and VVD voters. One could interpret the result as a vote against the government, which was not very popular at the time, but also as a general protest against the political establishment, and against the European Union itself, which in the past had benefited the Dutch economy, but was now increasingly perceived to be becoming too costly, too bureaucratic and too large. Although the government was not formally bound by the consultative referendum, it decided not to submit the Treaty to parliament. However, the discussion about Europe would continue.</p>

         <p>Wilders used the momentum of his campaign against the European Constitution to start building his own party (to be called ‘Freedom Party’, <i>Partij voor de Vrijheid</i>, in 2006). In March, he published a manifesto entitled ‘Declaration of Independence’ (<i>Onafhankelijkheidsverklaring</i>) – referring not only to his own independence of mind, but also to the independence of the Netherlands, which was threatened (in his eyes) by the growing European ‘superstate’ as well as by multiculturalism. In September, he began recruiting parliamentary candidates for the next general elections expected in 2007. Meanwhile, Wilders’ main rival on the populist right side of the party spectrum, the List Pim Fortuyn (LPF, <i>Lijst Pim Fortuyn</i>), continued its internal fighting in 2005. In June, Hilbrand Nawijn, former Minister for Foreigners and Integration and elected to parliament in 2003, left the LPF and became an independent MP. He fell out with other members of the LPF when he established close contacts with the Flemish party <i>Vlaams Belang</i> (formerly the Flemish Bloc, <i>Vlaams Blok</i>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In June, parliament approved a major reform of the Dutch health care system as well as a social security reform. Health care would be privatized as of 1 January 2006, but under strict conditions. Insurance companies (some of them cooperatives) would offer all inhabitants of the Netherlands basic health care (including general practice and hospital care), but different packages of additional care would be offered at different prices. People with a very low income, who probably had never paid for insurance before, would receive some compensation (<i>zorgtoeslag</i>) from the tax office. The Industrial Disability Act (<i>Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheid</i>) was replaced by a new law that was to provide more incentives for partially disabled persons to go back to work.
         </p>
         
         <p>In September, the Court of The Hague concluded that the SGP should no longer receive subsidies from the Dutch government because it violated the United Nations Treaty on Women by excluding women from party membership. The judge refused to give a verdict on the party constitution, however, as the claimant (a foundation) had requested. The Minister of Home Affairs, Johan Remkes (VVD), appealed the decision of the court, but announced that subsidies would stop on 1 January 2006. The executive committee of the SGP regretted the decision. The party was internally divided about the issue, which also weighed on its relationship with the Christian Union. The latter had nominated women for municipal elections (to be held in 2006) on common lists with the SGP. When the executive committee of the SGP disapproved of these lists in four cases, two of its members resigned and some prominent party members even left the party. In December, party leader Bas van der Vlies managed to reconcile the conflict: the common lists were approved after all.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>The Dutch Constitution prescribes the appointment of mayors by the Queen (i.e., the government). Most Dutch parties considered this an outdated procedure that should be replaced by either direct election by the people or election by the municipal council. In 2002, a constitutional amendment passed both houses of parliament that left this issue to a regular law. Constitutional amendments require a second reading, however. In November 2004, the lower house voted by more than two‐thirds in favour of the amendment. Yet on 22 March 2005, the upper house voted against it (42 to 31). The senators had different reasons to do so. The Christian Democrats and the two Protestant parties objected to any change and wished to retain the traditional procedure of appointment by the Queen. The left‐wing opposition preferred election by the municipal council to direct election, which they considered too populist a procedure. The PvdA was badly divided about the whole question. Wouter Bos, the party leader, and most members of the lower house favoured direct election, whereas in an internal party referendum in October 2004 only a third of the members agreed with this option and almost two‐thirds had voted for election by the municipal council. The senators resisted pressure from Bos and also voted against the constitutional amendment.</p>
         
         <p>The Minister for Institutional Reform, Thom de Graaf (D66), resigned the next day. His credibility had been undermined, he felt, by this decision of the upper house, but also by lack of support for his other reform proposals – in particular the reform of the electoral system. A crisis seemed in the offing. However, the other Democrat in the cabinet, Laurens‐Jan Brinkhorst (Minister of Economic Affairs), and state secretary (junior minister) Medy van der Laan decided after some deliberation that they would not follow De Graaf's example. On 26 March – a day before Easter – the party leaders of D66, CDA and VVD reached an agreement to renew the coalition. The ‘Easter Agreement’ entailed more government expenditures for education, innovation and research (to promote the ‘knowledge economy’), a reform of the broadcasting system and an investigation of new constitutional reforms. The D66 party congress approved the agreement on 2 April; the two other parties did not need to consult a party congress about this matter. The president of D66, Alexander Pechtold, succeeded De Graaf as Minister for Institutional Reform. He would prepare different procedures for consulting citizens as well as experts about a new electoral system and other political reforms.</p>
         
         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> Party funding</h3>
            
            <p>Every party represented in the Dutch parliament is entitled to a government subsidy, proportional to its number of seats. In October 2004, the Minister of Home Affairs proposed a new funding scheme that would take into account not only the number of seats in parliament, but also the number of (dues‐paying) party members. Some 80 per cent of the subsidy would be based on the number of seats, and 20 per cent on the number of members that paid an annual fee of at least €12. Parties were also to be allowed to spend the subsidies on election campaigns and recruitment of members, which had not been allowed under the old law. In March 2005, the lower house approved the bill. It also agreed with Remkes's proposal to raise the total amount of subsidies to €15 million. However, the legislation of party funding was not completed yet. Remkes prepared a second bill that would regulate donations to parties, oblige them to publish party income and (possibly) allocate subsidies to new parties. Parliament would discuss this bill in 2006.</p>
