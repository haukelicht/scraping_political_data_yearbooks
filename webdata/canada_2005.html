         <p>As 2006 began, Canadians were in the midst of an eight‐week election (the longest in several decades) that an 18 month‐old minority Liberal Government was forced to call after being defeated in parliament in late November 2005. Prime Minister Martin was counting on a long campaign to enable him both to scare voters about the prospect of an extreme right‐wing Conservative Government and to persuade the public that his party had cleaned itself up after the revelations of scandal over the previous year. However, as the new year opened, the Liberals found themselves trailing a Conservative Party that was more disciplined and united than it had been in the four previous elections (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2006</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives were determined not to allow the Liberals to label them, and so endlessly repeated a commitment to five priorities – government accountability, reduction in the value added tax, a universal child care payment, tougher penalties for criminals and a reduction in health care waiting lists – promising to make them the centerpiece of a new government. Voters responded perhaps most powerfully to the accountability message, which spoke to their revulsion at Liberal Government scandal. The result, in an election in which voter turnout increased for the first time in two decades, gave the Liberals their second lowest vote share in Canadian history. The Conservatives saw their support grow, but only to 36.2 per cent – not enough to produce a majority government given increased New Democrat seats and the Bloc Québécois' ability to hold its own. As long as the Bloc prevails in French‐speaking Quebec, it is able to win up to two‐thirds of the province's 75 seats. In a house of just over 300, this makes it very difficult for any single party to create a genuinely national majority. This election saw the Liberals and Conservatives change places as the largest party in a minority parliament – an outcome that may well set the pattern for future contests in the absence of a significant change in the party system.</p>
         
         <p>While the fragmented system appears to have settled into a recognizable shape, the basis of the parties themselves continues to evolve. The Conservatives' increased support meant that they returned members from all but the tiniest province (Prince Edward Island, with just four seats) for the first time since the 1980s. However, they were effectively shut out of the country's three largest cities where the Liberals, despite their other failures, continued to thrive. On the left, the New Democrats saw their rural base continue to slip away, and for the second election in a row saw no one elected in Saskatchewan – their greatest stronghold for over half a century. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the election was the split in the federalist vote in Quebec: the Conservatives outpolled the Liberals 25:21. The Liberals managed to win just 13 seats (the second lowest number they had ever won there), while the Conservatives captured 10 (their first Quebec successes since they reunited).</p>
         
         <p>There were still more surprises to come. On 6 February, Conservative leader Stephen Harper unveiled his government and, in the habit of recent new Prime Ministers, it was smaller than his predecessor's. More surprising was the appointment of two of its key figures. Vancouver's David Emerson was appointed Minister for International Trade despite the fact that he had been a senior minister in the outgoing Liberal Government and had been re‐elected as a Liberal. Indeed, he accepted his appointment before the election writs were returned, effectively crossing the floor before being officially elected. Emerson argued that he had left a senior position in business to serve in Martin's cabinet and saw little difference in agreeing to do the same for Harper. Many of his constituents disagreed and launched a vociferous (if unsuccessful) local campaign to have him resign. Harper's other surprise cabinet appointment was of Michael Fortier to be Minister of Public Works and Government Services with an unofficial mandate to represent Montreal in cabinet. What made this surprising was that Fortier had not contested the election so had to be appointed to the Senate to ensure a seat in Parliament. Having been an advocate for Senate reform (including its election), Harper appeared to be reneging on one of the most cherished causes of his western supporters on the first day in office.</p>
         
         <p>Given the Conservatives long stretch in the political wilderness, this was a cabinet full of individuals, including the Prime Minister, who had little or no experience in government. However, the very determined focus on the party's five priorities during the election campaign gave it a clear agenda and it is striking that the Prime Minister appointed individuals with provincial government experience to shepherd those policy initiatives. Thus by the end of the year, the Conservatives could reasonably claim to have made significant progress on at least four of their priorities, with health care issues being bogged down in federal‐provincial intergovernmental politics. The only ripple to mar the government was Michael Chong's resignation as Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs over the Prime Minister's sponsorship of a parliamentary resolution (designed to embarrass the Liberals) to recognize the Quebecois as a ‘nation within a united Canada’. All in all, not a spectacular year, but certainly a far more solid and steady performance than many had expected.</p>
         
         <p>The new government's most problematic decisions centered on its enthusiastic commitment of Canadian forces to the NATO‐sponsored counter‐insurgency action in southern Afghanistan. It inherited the obligation from the outgoing Martin Liberal Government, but was keen to endorse and enhance it as part of a general policy of strengthening and celebrating the country's long‐neglected armed forces. Public enthusiasm was perhaps never so great, but as dead soldiers began to be brought home – something Canadians have had little recent experience of – attitudes began to shift. This is an issue with the potential to unsettle electoral calculations – especially in Quebec, the province that historically has had little appetite for foreign military adventures.</p>
         
         <p>With the Liberal's defeat, Paul Martin took no time to ponder his ongoing leadership. In a televised election‐night concession speech he announced he would not lead the party into another election. With the prospect of a short minority parliament in front of it, the party was quickly thrown into a leadership race only to hear some of its most prominent figures declare they would not be contestants. This quickly encouraged a large number of others to enter the race and at one time there were as many as eleven declared candidates, though several would drop out along the way. The long process involved the election of local delegates, bound to vote as directed by constituency party members (on the first ballot) at a national selection convention. In the past, these contests had been extravagant exercises, but the Liberals discovered that the new regulations governing party finance (some of which they had authored in 2003) constrained the fundraising necessary to mount traditional nationwide leadership campaigns.</p>
         
         <p>As the November convention convened it was evident that three of the four leading candidates were men with no significant experience in the national party. One had spent most of his professional adult life outside the country (though he had been elected to Parliament in January), a second had been a New Democratic MP and then a provincial New Democratic Party premier, while the third had a couple of years experience as a minister in a provincial Liberal government. The fourth candidate was Stéphane Dion, a former professor of political science, who had served in both the Chrétien and Martin cabinets as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and later of the Environment. The only Francophone in a party with a tradition of alternating leaders between English‐ and French‐speakers, Dion ran on a policy of balancing economic development and social security with a concern for environmental sustainability and ended up leading something of a generational revolt in the party. Starting from third place (of eight) with just 17 per cent on the first ballot, he quickly gathered support and ultimately prevailed on the fourth. Thus, as the year ended, the party found itself positioned to make the environment a major theme in the next election.</p>
         
         <p>Interest in institutional tinkering never completely disappears in Canada and the new Conservative Government fastened on the Senate as its target. As a regionally unevenly balanced house of unelected members who sit undisturbed until age 75, the Senate has long been a focus for reform among western populists who constitute an important part of the Conservative Party's base. Thus it was perhaps no surprise that the government moved to begin reforming the upper house. Any change is likely to be piecemeal since a complete reshaping would require opening the Constitution and obtaining the provinces' consent – something prime ministers are now sensibly reluctant to begin. The Conservatives introduced bills that would limit Senatorial terms to eight years and provide for electoral ‘consultations’ about who should be appointed – a scheme to introduce Senate elections by the backdoor. By the end of the year, the government had made no progress in getting these changes enacted, but was signalling that they would be priority items for 2007.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, electoral reform has been a lively issue in recent years and despite setbacks to the reform agenda in 2005 (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2006</a></span>), it continued as an issue. Ontario, the largest province, convened a Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform, modeled on the successful Assembly held during 2004 in British Columbia. This Assembly, made up of 103 randomly selected citizens, is charged with studying and debating which electoral system might best serve the province. It is due to report in the spring of 2007 and, if it recommends abandoning the first‐past‐the‐post system for some other, its proposal will be put to a province‐wide referendum in the autumn.
