</h2>
         
         <p>The year 2010 started with the revelation that the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, was being treated for cancer. This provided an apt if depressing metaphor for the state of Ireland's finances. While Lenihan displayed strength and fortitude in battling his cancer, the same could not be said for Ireland. The cancer in Ireland's finances was spreading. By November this was crystallised in the intervention of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to give what was characterised as a ‘bail‐out’ for Ireland. The fall from grace of what was once the economic poster boy for Europe was complete. The ‘bail‐out’ sealed in the mind of the Irish electorate that the economy had been mismanaged by successive Fianna Fáil‐led governments. Earlier attempts to blame the depth of the Irish crisis on the international financial crisis were always self‐serving. Several reports and the EU/IMF intervention confirmed that Ireland was different.</p>
         
         <p>The main political casualty of the economic crisis was Fianna Fáil. Although it did not have to face the electorate in 2010, the party, for a long time Ireland's dominant party and one of the strongest and most durable parties in the democratic world, experienced poll figures it could not have imagined just two years earlier. An opinion poll in December had it in fourth place. The government it led, supported by the Green Party and a number of independents, had effectively disintegrated by November when the Green Party announced that it wanted an election in January 2011 after a budget had been introduced and passed. The party's decision to pre‐announce the election caused real concerns that the independent and some Fianna Fáil TDs (MPs) supporting the Government would withdraw their support and Ireland would fail to pass a budget.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the problems for the Government, the main opposition party, Fine Gael, seemed unable to capitalise on Fianna Fáil's misfortunes. It underwent a leadership heave in the summer and was overtaken by the usually small Labour Party in public opinion polls. Fine Gael's leader, Enda Kenny, was never regarded as a natural communicator in the media and seemed to fail to connect with voters in urban Ireland. When in February a high‐profile TD who had been elected in a by‐election just a year earlier announced his resignation from the Dáil, this put severe pressure on Kenny who promised to improve his performances.</p>
         
         <p>That pressure was relieved somewhat by the travails within the Government parties. In early February, one of the Green Party's senators resigned from parliament citing concerns that the party had lost its voice within the Government. This followed the resignations of a number of local councillors from the party for broadly similar reasons. The Greens then suffered the resignation of a junior minister and former party leader when it was revealed that he made representations to the Gardaí (police) on behalf of a constituent.</p>
         
         <p>Fianna Fáil had similar problems. A number of TDs had resigned the party whip in 2009, and more threatened to do so in early 2010. In February, the Minister for Defence, Willie O'Dea, was forced to resign his ministerial position when it was alleged he had made a defamatory statement against a Sinn Féin councillor to a journalist the previous year. This was taped and seemed to contradict a statement he had given in a sworn affidavit, leading to questions whether he had perjured himself. Because of the increasingly fragile nature of the Government majority in the Dáil, what had been a ‘belt and braces’ coalition majority now relied more heavily on the Green Party's continued support. As a result, its power within the Government increased. The Green Party made it clear it was unhappy with O'Dea's attitude to the charge and O'Dea was forced to resign by an obviously reluctant Taoiseach. It may have had the impact of worsening relations between the Government parties.</p>
         
         <p>O'Dea's resignation was followed by another minister's retirement from politics. Martin Cullen cited health problems as the reason for resigning from government and the Dáil. The replacement of these ministers was postponed, leading to speculation that it would involve a radical overhaul of the Government. The reshuffle that transpired in late March was conservative with many Fianna Fáil ministers being switched in portfolios, but no one was dismissed and only two replacements were brought in for the departed ministers. Both replacements had already been sitting at the cabinet table as junior ministers. The conservatism of the reshuffle meant that many on the Fianna Fáil backbenches could no longer reasonably harbour hopes of promotion and rebelliousness in the party became more common.</p>
         
         <p>The parlous state of the economy continued to receive the attention of the international media, and in April it was announced that the estimated cost of the bank bail‐out was €73 billion or about half of Ireland's annual gross domestic product (GDP). The banking crisis affected the real economy with unemployment rising and the public finances in severe deficit. There were further public sector pay cuts and cut backs in government spending. It did not seem the public was convinced by Government announcements that ‘the worst is over’ or that the Government's economic strategy was working.</p>
         
         <p>Despite these problems, Fine Gael was also doing badly in opinion polls and throughout the spring Enda Kenny's front bench seemed to give him, at best, qualified support. The electorate would have been forgiven for having the impression that he was a leader on probation. An opinion poll in June put the Labour Party ahead of Fine Gael, making Labour the best supported party for the first time (albeit only in opinion polls). Many TDs could not understand why Fine Gael was not making more headway given the problems in the Government. TDs and the media had frequently questioned the leader's ability to connect with voters, and may have thought a change of leader could do no harm. In the aftermath of the June poll, Kenny looked for support in his leadership to be given publically, which triggered a challenge to his leadership. Richard Bruton, the deputy party leader, finance spokesman and brother of former leader and Taoiseach John Bruton, was seen as the leader of the younger, more urban side of the party. His refusal to support Kenny publically caused him to be removed from the Fine Gael front bench by Kenny.</p>
         
         <p>Bruton knew this would necessarily cause a heave against Kenny's leadership and he and his confederates had seemed to have everything going for them. Their plan had been that the front bench would one by one declare against Kenny in the meeting of the front bench, and it was hoped and expected that in the face of such a serious rebellion Kenny would voluntarily stand down. But by approaching Kenny with the refusal to support him, he alerted Kenny to the threat, and so when this front bench meeting happened, Bruton was not there as he had been sacked. Kenny refused to allow the rebels' plan take hold as he informed them that there would be a reshuffle the following week and then cut the meeting short. Kenny had taken control of events and immediately put down a motion of confidence in his leadership to be held just two days later – giving the rebels less time than they would have liked. Half the front bench immediately came out against Kenny, and some more followed, backing Richard Bruton to become the new leader.</p>
         
         <p>However, the challengers seemed to lack a back‐up plan when Kenny refused to resign voluntarily. They also lacked an understanding of the rules of the confidence motion. The electorate for such a motion in Fine Gael is its parliamentary party. Bruton and his supporters spent a good deal of time on the national airwaves trying to convince ordinary voters that Kenny had to be removed. Kenny, on the other hand, worked on the parliamentary party members. When the parliamentary party met to vote, Kenny won the motion reportedly by six votes out of a parliamentary party of 70 (the results of the vote were not officially released). Kenny demoted the visibly upset Bruton from the Finance portfolio but kept him in the shadow cabinet. Others were also demoted or sacked as Kenny put his supporters around him.<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile the economy continued to deliver more bad news for the Government, as revelations about the Bank Guarantee Scheme showed that the Government had been made aware of the potential liabilities the state might be exposed to with its introduction (see <span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">O'Malley 2009</a></span>). More announcements were made about the costs of the bank recapitalisation, which once again beat previous worst case scenarios. The Government's current budget deficit also increased to €15 billion (over 10 per cent of GDP) and twice the previous estimate, which forced the Government to indicate that even harsher cuts would be necessary in the budget scheduled for early December.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, had been one of the biggest losers from the economic crisis. He had been the Minister for Finance from 2004 to 2008 and so was blamed for his mismanagement, or lack of management of the economy that had caused the property bubble and resulting banking crisis. This view was backed by two reports into the banking crisis by Patrick Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, and two international banking experts, Klaus Regling and Max Watson. The reports blame misguided government policies and a weak system of financial regulation as well as risky bank lending. Cowen's other problem was the sense that he could not communicate with the public about the nature of the crisis and the Government's plan to extricate the country from the crisis. By contrast, his Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, managed to command a reasonably high degree of support, and was frequently mentioned as a possible replacement. This led some to suggest that their relationship had broken down.</p>
         
         <p>In September, Cowen's poor communications skills were displayed when he gave an interview on a morning radio news programme. His lacklustre and at times incoherent presentation was so poor that an opposition TD tweeted suggesting Cowen was drunk or hung over. Cowen apologised for his performance claiming he had a cold, but senior colleagues warned that the Taoiseach had to learn lessons from the episode and make more efforts in his communications strategy. There was increasing nervousness in Fianna Fáil as opinion polls continue to show the party trailing Labour and Fine Gael. The realisation that the upcoming budget would be even tougher than the previous three ‘hairshirt’ budgets, and because many Fianna Fáil TDs may have felt voting against the Government was the best way to ensure re‐election, meant there was no certainty that the Government still had a majority.</p>
         
         <p>The resignation of a number of Fianna Fáil TDs and one Fine Gael TD meant that there were numerous vacancies in the Dáil. Casual vacancies are filled by a by‐election, which is caused by the ‘moving the writ’ in the Dáil. While traditionally the writ was moved by the party of the departed or deceased TD, it effectively required a majority in the Dáil and hence Government support. The Government refused to allow any of these by‐elections, one of which had been caused by the resignation of a Fianna Fáil TD who had been elected to the European Parliament in 2009. A Sinn Féin senator, Pearse Doherty, took a High Court case against the Government to force it to allow the by‐elections, which he won. The Government immediately moved the writ on this, causing a by‐election, which Doherty then won easily. Another Fianna Fáil TD resigned his seat in November and the prospect that all three outstanding by‐elections would be held in the new year meant it was almost certain the Government would lose its working majority.</p>
         
         <p>The continuing problems in the public finances were such that the Government feared it would not be able to access money on international markets when it ran out of reserves, estimated to be sometime in mid‐2011. The cost of insuring Irish government bonds continued to rise to record levels despite the announced intention of making €6 billion in cuts in the budget. The Irish banks were continuing to lose deposits despite the government‐backed guarantees, and the European Central Bank (ECB) was filling the gap by putting deposits into the banks. The ECB apparently was tiring of this temporary measure and preferred a more permanent arrangement.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the repeated and probably necessary assurances that Ireland was not negotiating with the EU/IMF on a possible programme of support for Ireland, by mid‐November the Government was forced to concede to what were alleged to be ECB demands for an EU/IMF intervention. Officials from the EU and IMF arrived and within days had negotiated an €85 billion loan. The Government revealed that it agreed to make €15 billion in cuts or tax increases, including 25,000 public sector job cuts over the following four years. As it transpired the ‘bail‐out’ was a loan given at penal interest rates to facilitate the Irish government to pay back debts the Irish banks had assumed during the boom, which were then ‘nationalised’ by the Irish government as a result of the Bank Guarantee Scheme in 2008 (see <span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">O'Malley 2009</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The intervention, which opposition parties pushed hard to frame as a loss of sovereignty for the state, was a severe embarrassment for Fianna Fáil. It caused the Green Party to announce its intention to withdraw from the Government as soon as the budget measures were passed. The Government managed to pass the immediate measures announced in the budget on 6 December, despite the resignation of another Fianna Fáil TD from the party and statements from some of the independents on which the Government depended that their support was not assured. Having passed those elements of the budget, it became a matter of timing as to when in 2011 the general election would be held.</p>
         
         <p>In the run up to the inevitable election many Fianna Fáil ministers and TDs indicated that they would not be running for re‐election. An opinion poll putting Fianna Fáil at just 13 per cent and behind Sinn Féin, Labour and Fine Gael caused many other senior members of Fianna Fáil to question whether Brian Cowen should remain as leader of Fianna Fáil for that election. In the end, he survived what was an <i>annus horribilis</i> for Cowen, Fianna Fáil and Ireland.
