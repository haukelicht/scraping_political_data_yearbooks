            <p>Elections to the National Council (Nationalrat; lower chamber; see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy34-tbl-0001">1</a>) were held on 23 October 2011. These elections, which are conducted largely following proportional representation rules, were marked by two questions. First, a good deal of attention was devoted to whether the conservative and nationalist SVP/UDC (Swiss People's Party) would again receive the most votes, much as they had in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007. Their string of victories has given the SVP/UDC not only the image of being the clearly dominant party, and as permanently electorally successful, but has also strongly influenced the Swiss party system. Second, political observers and commentators wondered whether the parties new to the national elections – namely the GLP/pvl (Swiss Green Liberal Party) and the BDP/PBD (Conservative Democratic Party), the latter the result of a 2008 split inside the SVP/UDC – would be successful. Both questions received quite clear answers: the SVP/UDC was unable to extend its winning streak and instead suffered painful losses. Both new parties were able to do quite well and were seen as the clear victors of the election.

            <p>Nevertheless, at 26.6 per cent (−2.3 per cent), the SVP/UDC remains the largest party, followed by the SPS/PSS (Swiss Social Democratic Party) at 18.7 per cent (−0.8 per cent), and the two old centre‐right parties, the FDP/PLR (FDP/The Liberals) at 15.1 per cent (−0.7 per cent) and the CVP/PDC (Christian Democrat People's Party) at 12.3 per cent (−2.2 per cent). The FDP/PLR is the result of a 2009 fusion of the FDP/PLR (2007: 15.8 per cent) and the LPS/PLS (Swiss Liberal Party; 2007: 1.9 per cent), so its losses in 2011 loom that much larger. The GPS/PES (Swiss Green Party), at 8.4 per cent (−1.4 per cent), also suffered losses, though it did better overall than its two new rivals, the BDP/PBD (+5.4 per cent) and the GLP/pvl (+4.0), each of which received 5.4 per cent of the vote. Thanks to favourable electoral mathematics, the GLP/pvl received 12 seats in the National Council (+9), and was able to make more of its success than could the BDP/PBD, which only received nine seats (+9). The SPS/PSS, despite slight losses in voting share, was also able to profit from seat distribution rules and added three new seats to reach a total of 46 in the National Council. Both the FDP/PLR (30 seats, −5) and the GPS/PES (15 seats, −5) had to cope with considerable losses, though the CVP/PDC still retains 28 seats (−3). With the loss of eight seats, the SVP/UDC clearly had to give up the most, even though, at 54 seats, it remains the largest faction in the National Council.</p>

            <p>The SVP/UDC put itself under pressure by announcing an ambitious goal of wanting to be represented in the second chamber in numbers corresponding to their popularity, and voting share, in the lower chamber. Such a goal is not easy to achieve, in part due to cantonal variety and in part because the upper chamber is regarded as more politically moderate than the lower. Though the SVP/UDC sent some of its best‐known representatives into the running, they were not successful. On the contrary: the SVP/UDC actually lost three seats, and now has only five members in the upper chamber.</p>
            
            <p>The CVP/PDC (13 seats, −2) and the FDP/PLR (11 seats, −2), traditionally well‐represented in the upper chamber, both lost seats. Among the winners, one finds the SPS/PSS, which like the FDP/PLR now has 11 seats (+2), and the new parties at the national level, the GLP/pvl (2 seats, +1) and the BDP/PBD (1 seat, +1). The GPS/PES was able to hold its two seats in this chamber. One new independent candidate, who became nationally known for a popular initiative he launched ‘against rip‐offs’ (‘gegen die Abzockerei’), was able to defeat candidates from the established parties in the canton of Schaffhausen.</p>
            
            <p>The SVP/UDC must be regarded as the electoral losers in the upper chamber as well: their electoral showing was strong enough to force holding a second round of voting in only a few cantons. The pointedly conservative and nationalist positions of candidates campaigning for the SVP/UDC did not convince voters even to shift their support to more moderate candidates of other centre‐right parties. Competition on the right end of the political spectrum, in the end, benefitted left‐wing candidates. Thus, in St Gallen, traditionally a clearly centre‐right canton, a pointedly union‐oriented Social Democrat was elevated into the upper chamber – and that despite the fact that his major opponent was the president of the national SVP/UDC.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> General remarks about and analyses of the national elections</h3>
            
            <p>In the 2011 national election, voting participation was 48.5 per cent, quite comparable to the previous parliamentary election in 2007 (48.3 per cent), and above the record‐low values seen during the 1990s (1995: 42.2 per cent; 1999: 43.3 per cent). This comparatively low electoral participation rate, when compared with other democracies, usually is ascribed to Switzerland's direct democratic traditions and federalist political structure. The slight upward trend in voting participation rates since the mid‐1990s is ascribed to an increasing erosion of what has thus far been an exceedingly stable political party system (Lutz <span><a href="#epdy34-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy34-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 7).
            </p>
            
            <p>Existing analyses indicate the election was not, as in previous years, strongly influenced by migration policy issues, but instead by other topics. One was energy policy, the salience of which increased considerably after the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan. Another, in the wake of the global finance crisis, was economic policy (Lutz 2012: 28). In the past, the SVP/UDC has had considerable success at mobilising voters over immigration issues, but they do not seem to have been nearly as successful at doing so in 2011. Other parties appear to have been more convincing both with respect to energy and on economic policy questions. This applies in particular to the two parties new to the national scene: the GLP/pvl and the BDP/PBD. The latter, as a splinter party of the conservative and nationalist SVP/UDC, rather surprisingly came out in favour of abandoning nuclear power.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, the 2011 elections did not, unlike in previous national elections, lead to a further strengthening of the parties at the ends of the political spectrum. Instead, the mainstream centrist parties profited – though less the established parties, such as the FDP/PLR and CVP/PDC, than the new BDP/PBD and GLP/pvl. In previous elections, five parties usually obtained at least 5 per cent of the vote; this number has now increased to 7. At the national level, the Swiss party system thus has become more varied. It remains to be seen whether this will lead to greater simplification or greater difficulties in the political decision‐making process.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy34-sec-0006-title"> Changes in Parliament</h2>
         
         <p>In addition to changes in seat occupancy brought about by the parliamentary elections of 23 October 2011, other changes in personnel took place during 2011. On 9 February 2011, National Councillor Thomas Müller, representing the canton of St Gallen, decided to quit the CVP/PDC and switch to the SVP/UDC, and also changed his parliamentary party affiliation. National Councillor Norman Gobbi, a representative of the Lega (League of the People of Ticino), resigned his seat on 14 April 2011 owing to his election into his canton's executive council. He was replaced by Lorenzo Quadri, also representing the Lega, on 30 May 2011. Following a heart attack suffered in 2010, National Councillor André Daguet, representing the SPS/PSS for the canton of Bern, resigned as of 29 May 2011 and was replaced the next day by Corrado Pardini, also of the SPS/PSS. On the same day, National Councillor Adrian Amstutz, a representative of the SVP/UDC for the canton of Bern, was elected into the Council of States and was replaced on 30 May 2011 by Thomas Fuchs, also representing the SVP/UDC for Bern.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy34-sec-0007-title"> Changes in the cabinet (Federal Council)</h2>
         
         <p>Election of the entire Federal Council was held on 14 December 2011. Micheline Calmy‐Rey, representing the SPS/PSS and from the canton of Geneva, had declared she was resigning as of the end of 2011. Elected into the Federal Council in 2003, she was Federal President in both 2007 and 2011. The other six members of the Federal Council were standing for re‐election.</p>
         
         <p>The SPS/PSS proposed two candidates – Alain Berset and Pierre‐Yves Maillard – as potential successors to Federal Councillor Calmy‐Rey. Berset, a representative of the canton of Fribourg in the Council of States since 2003, was also President of the Council of States in 2008–2009. Maillard, a member of Vaud's cantonal executive, represented his canton in the National Council from 1999 to 2004.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to these two SPS/PSS candidates, as well as the six Federal Councillors standing for re‐election, the SVP/UDC made efforts to obtain a second seat in the Cabinet. This challenge to the existing party distribution was justified with the argument that though the SVP/UDC was the strongest in electoral terms, it was not adequately represented by having only a single seat in the country's executive. It therefore put forward two candidates: Jean‐François Rime, a National Councillor representing the canton of Fribourg, who had already stood for the Cabinet in 2010, and Bruno Zuppiger, a National Councillor from Zürich. However, the latter withdrew his candidacy after reports about irregularities in his business practices surfaced in the press. Hansjörg Walter, a National Councillor representing the canton of Thurgau, replaced him as candidate. Others, both from governing and non‐governing parties, were discussed as potential candidates but on election day none of them received more than about a dozen votes from the United Federal Assembly.</p>
         
         <p>Under current rules, Federal Council elections proceed according to seniority in office, so the first seat to be voted on was that of Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard (CVP/PDC, Aargau). In an uncontested election, Councillor Leuthard was re‐elected in the first round with 216 of 227 valid votes. Councillor Eveline Widmer‐Schlumpf (BDP/PBD, Graubünden) was also re‐elected in the first round with 131 of 239 valid votes. In this election, votes also went to the two SVP candidates, with Walter receiving 63 votes and Rime 41. Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer (SVP/UDC, Zürich) was then re‐elected in the first round with 159 of 226 valid votes. SVP candidate and National Councillor Walter received 41 votes. The fourth seat was that of Federal Councillor Didier Burkhalter (FDP/PLR, Neuchatel), which he defended ably by receiving 194 of 232 valid votes in the first round. SVP/UDC National Councillor Rime received 24 votes. The fifth seat to be selected had been occupied until the election by Federal Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga (SPS/PSS, Bern). She, too, was elected in the first round, with 179 of 242 valid votes. National Councillor Rime (SVP/UDC, Fribourg) received 61 votes. The sixth Federal Council member standing for re‐election, Johann Schneider‐Ammann (FDP/PLR, Bern), was also re‐elected without difficulty in the first round. Though National Councillor Rime received 64 votes, Federal Councillor Schneider‐Ammann was re‐elected with a clear majority of 159 of 234 valid votes.</p>
         
         <p>After the successful re‐election of all six sitting Federal Councillors, the now‐vacant seat of Federal President Calmy‐Rey needed to be filled. In the first round, no candidate received an absolute majority. Council of States member Berset received 114 votes, while Vaud cantonal executive member Maillard and National Councillor Rime each received 59 votes of the 243 valid votes cast. Yet already in the second round, Berset, who received 126 of 245 valid votes, was able to distance himself from competitors Maillard, who received 63 votes, and Rime, who received 54 votes.</p>
         
         <p>By its decisions, the United Federal Assembly in the end rejected the SVP/UDC's claim that it should be better or more strongly represented on the Federal Council. The elections to the Federal Council, generally speaking, contained no surprises and were conducted in the usual orderly manner. However, the follow‐up to the Federal Council elections did contain a small surprise in the allocation of the departmental responsibilities to the individual Councillors. The Federal Council decides itself how it will distribute the seven departments among its members, and concluded that Federal Councillor Burkhalter should move from the Federal Department of Home Affairs to become head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. This was a bit of a surprise to political commentators, not only because Burkhalter had been head of Home Affairs for only two years, but also because this switch weakened the political position of the centrist parties which have a clear majority in the Federal Council. The shift meant newly elected Federal Councillor Berset (SPS/PSS) was given leadership of the Federal Department of Home Affairs – a post regarded as politically weightier than that of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy34-sec-0008-title"> Results of national referenda and initiatives</h2>
         
         <p>As this was a national election year, and owing to the small number of national initiatives or referenda ready to be put to the vote, only one national vote was held, on 13 February 2011. It asked the electorate to decide on an initiative dating from 23 February 2009 which was meant to provide better protection from gun violence (firearms access initiative) (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy34-tbl-0003">3</a><a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy34-tbl-0004">4</a>; see Nai &amp; Sciarini <span><a href="#epdy34-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy34-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). To this end, according to the initiative, the spread of firearms was to be limited by creating a gun permit that attested to the need and aptitude of its holder. Members of the military would no longer be able to store their army‐issued hand‐weapons at home, and a national registry of weapons would replace the existing cantonal registers. The Federal Council and Parliament recommended turning down the initiative, not only because a legal foundation for protecting the population already existed but also because passage of the initiative would not guarantee the misuse of weapons would thereby lessen. Left and centre‐left parties supported the initiative, while centrist and right‐leaning parties opposed it. Numerous organisations and associations participated in the campaign, with those opposed either close to the military or rifle associations. Those in favour included groups critical of the military, religious communities, the Swiss medical association, women's organisations and unions.

         <p>At a good 49 per cent, voting participation was relatively high for an election with only a single issue on the ballot. However, this was in part due to mobilisation effects related to upcoming cantonal initiatives. With 56.3 per cent opposing, the voting result was quite clear. The additional requirement that the proposal be accepted by a majority of the cantons (the Ständemehr) was also clearly not reached by the approval of five full cantons (Geneva, Vaud, Neuchatel, Jura and Zürich) and one half‐canton (Basel‐Stadt). If one examines the results more closely, city and country responded differently: the initiative was clearly more strongly supported in urban than in rural areas. In addition, there was greater support for the initiative in French‐ than in German‐ and Italian‐speaking parts of Switzerland. Later analysis (Nai &amp; Sciarini <span><a href="#epdy34-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy34-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>) came to the conclusion that the initiative had a hard time particularly among older males with low levels of education. Support was particularly low among those who owned weapons, as well as among the members of rifle clubs. Among proponents, the main reason for supporting the initiative was the perceived need to reduce the dangers associated with weapons. Among opponents, the most frequent objection was that if the initiative were to be accepted, it would place limits on individual freedom and personal responsibility.
