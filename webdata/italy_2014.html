         <p>The year 2014 brought Italy a new, exceptionally active government; contentious elections to the European Parliament that confirmed the dominance of the Democratic Party; and three regional elections resulting from the corruption‐related resignation of regional presidents.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> European Parliament elections</h3>
            
            <p>The European elections became a duel between the country's two largest parties: the Democratic Party (PD) and the Five Star Movement (M5S). Both parties had received a quarter of the vote in the 2013 general elections, and the EP elections provided a test of the balance of power between the two after a year of PD‐led government. PD possessed two major assets in this competition: the radical upheaval in the party leadership in February 2014, which placed the leadership of both the party and the government in the hands of 39 year‐old Matteo Renzi; and a pre‐election decision to implement an €80 tax cut for most low‐salary workers. PD's main liability was the unusual process by which Renzi obtained the premiership: a kind of palace coup in which a meeting of the party executive called by Renzi passed a motion of censure against PD Prime Minister Enrico Letta, provoking Letta's immediate resignation. Because this move occurred only few days after Renzi had sent a tweet assuring Letta of his loyalty (#<i>enricostaisereno</i>, ‘enricobeconfident’) concerns were raised about Renzi's integrity, but the dynamism he brought to government policy and the popularity of some provisions – above all, the tax cut – more than compensated for the doubts of those who supported Letta.
            </p>
            
            <p>Beppe Grillo's M5S, on the contrary, suffered from two liabilities: the difficulty in managing the large parliamentary group that entered the chamber without previous political experience; and the loss of the flavour of political novelty once Renzi became a magnet for those attracted to newness. M5S's campaign focused the party's traditional anti‐politics rhetoric on hostility to a series of European Union obligations – the euro, the fiscal compact, the state balanced budget – advocated an alliance among the Mediterranean countries affected by the EU‐imposed austerity measures. But even more than the euroscepticism and the anti‐politics themselves, it was Grillo's vehemence that received the most attention and criticism. In the very last days of the electoral campaign he tried to moderate this aggressive image by appearing on the most significant talk show on Italian television (‘<i>Porta a Porta</i>’ [‘Door to Door’]), but the effort may have done more harm than good as it contradicted his previous fury against such shows and may have displeased more radically anti‐establishment voters.
            </p>
            
            <p>The two pivots of the campaign – PD and M5S – faced opposition on the right from Berlusconi's party Go Italy! (FI), the Northern League (LN) and the radically nostalgic Brothers of Italy (FdI), and from the left by Left‐Ecology‐Freedom (SEL). The latter was an ally of the PD in the 2013 electoral campaign which found itself excluded from government; it chose to participate in a new, more‐radical list called ‘The Other Europe’, inspired by the Greek radical left party <i>Syriza</i> and its leader Alexis Tsipras. Two other parties, which were coalition partners of the Letta and Renzi governments, also sought to find electoral space in the face of Renzi's advance: the centrist‐moderate New Centre‐Right (NCD), an offshoot of Berlusconi's party that emerged in the fall of 2013; and former Prime Minister Mario Monti's party, Civic Choice (SC).
            </p>
            
            <p>Italian law forbids the publication of public opinion polling results during the final 15 days of the election campaign, but the final polls suggested that PD could expect about 32 per cent of the vote and an 8–10 point lead over M5S. Renzi prudently announced that he would be happy any with any result higher than the party's 25.5 per cent share in the 2013 general election. Within the 15‐day blackout period, rumours circulating among opinion leaders suggested a much closer race between the two parties while media coverage suggested widespread anxiety within the establishment that victory by the M5S would undermine government efforts. The polls and rumours proved misleading, however, and the actual results left political actors and media moguls astonished: PD not only won the election, but its 40.8 per cent result was <i>the highest share any party had gained in a national election since 1958</i>. The PD also managed to break out of the historic bastions of the ‘red belt’ in centre‐north Italy, receiving the largest share of the vote in 106 of Italy's 108 provinces. Furthermore, it reached this level of success <i>without</i> the presence of Renzi's name on the party lists (contrary to the strategy of other parties, which put the party leaders at the top of every regional list). PD's triumph represented the second significant blow to political normality in Italy in less than a year, compounding the shock of the 25.5 per cent obtained by the political freshmen M5S in the 2013 general elections. The success of the left even extended beyond PD. The radical left ‘Other Europe’, with its explicit reference to its Greek counterparts in its colloquial name ‘Tsipras’ List’, also managed to reach the 4 per cent quota and to have several representatives elected.
            </p>
            
            <p>The M5S for its part not only failed to surpass PD, but fell short of its previous peak. Its 21.2 per cent, while respectable, was four percentage points lower than its share in the 2013 general election. Grillo reacted with humour to the defeat, modifying the pre‐election #<i>vinceremonoi</i> (‘wewillwin’) to #<i>vinceremopoi</i> (‘wewillwinnext’), and posting a video in which he took a well‐known pill against stomach acidity to smooth the defeat.
            </p>
            
            <p>Berlusconi's FI lost even more votes compared to the 2013 general election, dropping to 16.8 per cent – just over half the percentage that its predecessor, PdL, gained in the 2009 EP elections. The drop showed Berlusconi and his party to be increasingly out of touch, both with mainstream voters and with its traditional base – an impression that was not weakened, and may even have been strengthened, by Berlusconi's amicable relationship with Renzi.</p>
            
            <p>The LN fell to 6.2 per cent of the vote from its 10 per cent in the 2009 EP elections, but this actually represents a major recovery from leadership scandals that had hit the party severely in the intervening five years. Matteo Salvini, the LN's new, young leader, pushed the party to more radical anti‐immigrant, anti‐European discourse, and the party saw a steadily increasing performance throughout 2014, including in the Emilia Romagna regional election later in the year. The other minor radical‐nostalgic party, FdI, failed to overcome the 4 per cent hurdle necessary for representation in Strasbourg, but its 3.7 per cent exceeded any forecast. The relative success of these two parties compared to the struggles faced by the more centrist splinter of the PdL, NCD, which underperformed compared to expectations, and barely surpassed the electoral hurdle with 4.4 per cent, suggests that the voters haemorrhaged by FI remained to a large extent within the right‐wing camp, either voting for other right‐wing parties or abstained, waiting for a more credible right‐wing alternative.</p>
            
            <p>The volatility in this election was unidirectional in favour of the PD. Renzi's gain came from three sources: first, PD almost completely siphoned off the support of its government coalition partner SC; second, the party managed to attract some former non‐voters and disillusioned voters of M5S; and third, it preserved its own base, drawing nearly all of its 2013 voters to confirm their choice of the year before. The party managed this through the voters’ fear of Grillo's victory, the lack of credible proposals by the right‐wing parties, the specific pre‐election policy changes (especially the tax cut), and the dynamism of a seemingly‐tireless young head of government and his small (only 16 ministers) gender‐balanced government which projected the image of change and novelty for which the Italian public had long been waiting.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Regional elections</h3>
            
            <p>Elections were also held in three regions in 2014: Piedmont in May, and Emilia Romagna and Calabria in November. In Piedmont, new elections were called because a list supporting LN's Roberto Cota, President of the Piedmont region, had collect invalid signatures and thus the elections were annulled. At the same time, Cota and other officials faced investigation for falsified accounts (including a reimbursement for underwear in the distinctive green colour of the League). The PD profited from the circumstances and the popularity of its candidate, former Turin mayor Sergio Chiamparino, to win the new elections with 47 per cent of votes and a comfortable 25 per cent margin over the nearest competitor.</p>
            
            <p>Calabria's regional elections were caused by the criminal conviction of regional President Giuseppe Scopelliti of NCD (and formerly a regional leader in Berlusconi's PdL) for his falsification of budget accounts while serving as mayor of Reggio Calabria. The elections resulted in a 61.4 per cent landslide victory for Mario Oliviero (a member of PD and a veteran of the Italian communist tradition), who triumphed over young pro‐Renzi competitors in the PD's regional primary.</p>
            
            <p>The regional elections in Emilia Romagna attracted considerably more attention, beginning with the sudden resignation of Vasco Errani (PD), President of the region since 2000. Although Errani had the general reputation of being an efficient and honest politician (a view shared even by some in the right‐wing opposition), he was charged with malpractice in the financing of his brother's cooperative. His conviction weakened the PD's longstanding reputation in the region as a party of integrity at the same time that another judicial inquiry into the expenses of regional councillors revealed improper practices across the political spectrum. The coupling of a rising anti‐party sentiment with the discontent of the traditional leftist electorate with Renzi's negative attitude towards trade unions in that period provoked an unprecedented low level of turnout. In a region such as Emilia Romagna, which had always manifested the highest level of electoral participation since 1946, only 37.7 per cent of voters went to the polls – the lowest ever participation rate ever recorded for any Italian election. This result obscured the large victory of the PD candidate with 49.1 per cent of the vote. With the support of FI, the challenger candidate from LN obtained 29.8 per cent – a result that boosted the visibility of LN's new leader, Salvini, and his pointedly law‐and‐order and anti‐immigrant discourse.</p>

         <p>During the early weeks of 2014 the Letta government began to suffer from a significant loss of credibility and support both within the coalition and among public opinion and organised interests (Letta engaged in bitter public conflict with the president of the country's industrialists' associations). In February 2014, the PD party executive forced the resignation of its own government with an overwhelming 136 to 16 vote of no‐confidence. Letta's position was further weakened by unexpectedly low support from President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, who was often seen as Letta's protector. After Letta's resignation, Renzi received the investiture by the President of the Republic on 22 February 2014, and presented a compact cabinet with only 16 other ministers – all but four of whom were new to government. The government boasted gender parity and a low average age, with the youngest Prime Minister in the history of Italy and only three ministers above 60 years of age. Commentators expressed concerns about the government's inexperience, but it proved effective at communicating its plans for change and its approval rating rose from around 55 per cent to over 70 per cent after the EP elections – one of the highest levels of consent ever reached by an Italian government (and Renzi's personal rating was even higher).</p>

         <p>Government action covered a wide swathe of topics. The most sensitive and conflicting ones concerned the institutional reforms (a new electoral law and a constitutional intervention on the Senate) and new legislation on labour relations. On the institutional side, Renzi could rely on the support of Berlusconi's party. In fact, before taking the premiership, Renzi looked for an agreement with Berlusconi in order to jointly promote some reforms. This initiative was contested inside the PD because Renzi, in so doing, had offered an opportunity for Berlusconi to escape the marginality imposed by his conviction for fiscal fraud, which prohibited him from holding any public office for six years. Renzi's efforts achieved two important results: he countered the charge that PD's sole <i>raison d’ etre</i> was confronting Berlusconi; and he sterilised Berlusconi's opposition. This relationship proved essential for Renzi because he had to face opposition from two sides – both public criticism from M5S, and internal unrest within the left wing of the PD – but neither of these posed an effective counterweight to the government. The most efficacious and vocal opposition came from outside the parliamentary and political arena. The trade unions, especially the left‐wing Italian General Confederation of Labour once tied to the PD and its antecedents, called a general strike in the autumn against government proposals to increase flexibility in the labour market, but the protest did not prevent passage of the legislation. Supported by the economic and financial establishment, Renzi succeeded where Berlusconi had failed ten years earlier.
