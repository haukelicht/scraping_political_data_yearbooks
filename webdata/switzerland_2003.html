         <p>There were no changes in the personnel and party composition of the Swiss cabinet in 2004. Joseph Deiss (1946 male, CVP), who was elected President of the Swiss Federation, also presides over the Department of Economic Affairs (<i>Volkswirtschaftsdepartement</i>, EVD).

         <p>There have been no major changes since the parliamentary elections took place in 2003. Max Binder (SVP, canton Zurich) presided over the lower house (<i>Nationalrat</i>) until 11 November, and was succeeded by Jean‐Philippe Maitre (CVP, canton Geneva). The President of the upper house (<i>Ständerat</i>) is Fritz Schiesser (FDP, canton Glarus).

         <p>The first ballot of 2004 saw the Swiss people deciding against the Federal Council and Parliament on all three proposals. First, as a counter‐proposal to the Avanti initiative, there was an initiative that called for completion and expansion of the motorway network at critical junctions and for a second Gotthard tunnel. Since the latter would have meant an abrogation of the initiative accepted in 1994 for protection of the Alps, the <i>Bundesrat</i> formulated a counter‐proposal in which a second Gotthard tunnel was not scheduled. Against the will of the executive, Parliament re‐included the second tube, but did not fix a time limit for its construction. As the counter‐proposal went further than the initiative, the latter was withdrawn by the initiative committee. Thus, only the counter‐proposal was presented to the voters. The Social Democrats, the Green Party and some environmental organisations opposed the counter‐proposal and were successful. The prime reason for their success was that public attention focused mainly on one aspect of the proposal (the second tube through the Gotthard), being mentioned by 61 per cent of those who took part on the ballot as the content of the proposal (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2004</a></span>). While other aspects like the expansion of the motorway network in urban agglomerations found high acceptance, a second Gotthard tunnel was strongly opposed by a majority of voters and it was chiefly this that led to the clear rejection of the counter‐proposal.
         </p>
         
         <p>An even stronger blow to the government was the rejection of the rental law reform with 64 per cent voting against. Not even a majority of landlords, who would have benefited most from the linkage of rents to mortgage rates, were in favour of the reform (‘Yes’=47 per cent). One reason for the clear rejection by the voters was the low level of knowledge about the issue. Overall, voters (both tenants and landlords) considered the ballot not very important and their knowledge about the content of the proposal was crude. In a survey, only 58 per cent of the voters were able to remember what the ballot was about and 27 percent gave either ‘no answer’ to the content question or a wrong answer (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2004</a></span>). When unsure how to vote, people either choose the exit option or the status quo, which in this case meant ‘No’ to the rental reform.
         </p>
         
         <p>The last snub for Berne was the acceptance of life imprisonment for violent offenders. The <i>Verwahrungsinitiative</i> was aimed at life imprisonment for extremely violent criminals and sex offenders who are considered to be beyond reformation. Their cases would be reconsidered only if new scientific insights become available. Parliament and the executive were against the initiative, mainly because it could not be brought into line with the European Human Rights Convention. Although there was practically no visible campaign, people were well informed about the aims of the proposal and considered the ballot important. The post‐vote VOX analysis revealed that voting decision strongly was correlated with left‐right self‐placement. The more right one placed oneself, the higher the probability of supporting life imprisonment for violent offenders. However, the rejection among those who considered themselves far left was not very strong (only 68 per cent). Likewise, only 60 per cent of Social Democratic Party supporters followed the suggestion of the party to vote against the initiative.
         </p>
         
         <p>Did this triple blow for the government have anything to do with the change in the balance of power within the <i>Bundesrat</i>? The ballot was indeed the first since the assumption of office of the new executive, whose party‐political composition changed in 2003 for the first time since 1959. As the executive moved rightward, one could assume that the left voters’ trust in government would fade, which would result in higher opposition to the recommendations of the Federal Council and Parliament. A VOX analysis revealed that this was not exactly the case. Indeed, the left‐green camp showed a higher distrust in the government than before, but they were nonetheless the ideological group with the highest trust in government. It is more telling that the right voters’ typical distrust in government did not fade, although their representation in the executive increased.
         </p>
         
         <p>Things did not get better for the government with the next ballot on 16 May. All three proposals by the Federal Council and Parliament were overwhelmingly (by a majority of two‐thirds) rejected by the voters. No one expected such a disastrous defeat for the government. One of the reasons for the defeat was the rising distrust in government that reached a peak on 16 May. For the first time since 2000, a majority of Swiss voters (52 per cent) expressed distrust rather than trust (25 per cent) in the new government (23 per cent had no opinion or gave no answer), and of those who had little faith in the government, 58 per cent cast a triple ‘No’ vote (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Engeli 2004</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The eleventh revision of the Old Age and Survivors’ Insurance (AHV), which – to sum up the main aspects – would have raised the retirement age for women to 65 and modified benefits for widows and orphans, and in so doing injected some CHF925 million a year into the AHV, was rejected by nearly all social and political groups. Even right‐wing voters who mostly agree that social spending should be cut were only barely (52 per cent) in favour of the proposal, whereas the left overwhelmingly rebuffed it (about 85 per cent). The proposal to raise VAT to pay for AHV was supported by the left parties and the labour unions, but was nevertheless massively rejected by the Swiss voters. The clearest thumbs‐down to the VAT increase was given by the right‐wing partisans, but even the left was not in favour of what the opponents of the proposal called ‘tax stockpiling’.</p>
         
         <p>For the first time, eleven cantons made use of their right to launch a referendum, against the tax package that included tax concessions for families, married couples and home owners as well as abolishing the sales tax on securities trading. This referendum was successful because supporters believed that only the highest income classes would benefit from the tax reform and that taxes would generally increase.</p>
         
         <p>On 26 September, Swiss voters had to decide on three referenda and one initiative. The referenda were about facilitated citizenship for second‐generation foreigners, automatic citizenship for third‐generation foreigners, and maternity leave, while the initiative asked for a nationwide network of post offices and demanded that a possible deficit should be made good by the government. Only the maternity leave referendum – Switzerland was the last country in Europe without it – was accepted with 55.5 per cent of votes in favour. The two proposals regarding facilitated citizenship and the postal initiative were rejected by a majority of voters and cantons. The interviewees of the VOX survey that took place immediately after the ballot attached relatively high importance to all of the proposals, which is one reason for the above‐average turnout for the September ballot (53.2 per cent). Highest importance was attached to the maternity leave question, while the laws regarding facilitated citizenship were the best remembered, mainly because of the hotly discussed and controversial campaign that preceded the ballot.</p>
         
         <p>Both facilitated citizenship for second‐generation foreigners with immigrant parents and automatic citizenship for third‐generation foreigners were rejected by a majority of voters and cantons. Strongest opposition came from the mainly German‐speaking, rural cantons, while the French‐speaking part of Switzerland (with the exception of canton Valais) voted in favour of the two proposals. The so‐called ‘Rösti trench’ (which divides French‐ and German‐speaking Switzerland) yawned deep and wide once again. The reason for the eye‐catching difference in voting behaviour between the two main language regions was attitudes towards foreigners. French‐speaking Switzerland has, due to a different understanding of the concept ‘nation’, a more xenophile attitude towards foreigners than German‐speaking Switzerland. Individual attitudes towards foreigners also explain the differences in voting behaviour <i>within the language regions</i> and consequently led to the clear rejection of both proposals. In comparison to 1994, when Swiss voters had to decide on a very similar proposal, which then was rejected only by a majority of the cantons but not by a majority of the voters, facilitated citizenship found less acceptance in all social and political strata.
         </p>
         
         <p>The maternity leave vote also reflected the sociocultural differences between German‐ and French‐speaking Switzerland. The new law, which assures mothers 80 per cent of their salary for 14 weeks after giving birth to a child, was supported overwhelmingly in Western Switzerland, while the German‐speaking cantons showed less support. However, thanks to the clear ‘yes’ of the mainly urban German‐speaking regions, the ballot did not result in a defeat for the maternity leave supporters, as in 1999 when Swiss voters decided on a very similar proposal. At that time, French‐speaking Switzerland was mainly in favour of the proposal, but the whole German‐speaking part (including the urban regions) was against it.</p>
         
         <p>The postal initiative was considered to be less important than the other proposals. The content of the initiative was relatively complex and, as a result, voters had problems coming to a decision. Left‐right self‐placement did not have the same impact on the voting decision as in the other ballots, although the vote was interpreted in the run‐up as a vote against or for liberalisation. The empirical analysis of the voting behaviour showed that it was not mainly ideological antagonism that decided the outcome, but rather the level of concern. People who feared they would be affected by the slimming of public services voted heavily in favour of the initiative, while those who did not fear any consequences or do not use postal services voted against it.</p>
         
         <p>The November 2004 ballot asked two constitutional and one legislative question. The turnout was that year's lowest (35.7 per cent) and was the third lowest within the last five years. One reason for the massive abstention was the high complexity of the proposals. The redesign of financial compensation and other tasks between the Confederation and the cantons affected 27 articles of the federal constitution. As a consequence, a lot of overstrained voters decided not to participate. Even those who did could hardly remember the topics of the ballot. A VOX analysis showed that, within four days after the ballot, only 30 per cent of those who participated could identify the new <i>Finanzordnung</i> as one of the topics. The numbers for the federal reform were 55 per cent, and for the stem cell research law 60 per cent.
         </p>
         
         <p>The redesign of the <i>Finanzordnung</i> and task sharing between the Confederation and cantons had two main concerns. The first was reallocation of tasks between federal authorities and the cantons with the focus on those with shared competences. Because the reform assigned sole responsibility for assisting the disabled to the cantons, the related organisations feared a curtailing of those social benefits and opposed the federal proposal. Second, the reform aimed at a new intercantonal compensation formula. This formula creates beneficiary and ‘donor’ cantons. Opposition came mainly from the cantonal section of the SVP in the more affluent cantons – although with little success. The proposal was given clear backing by 64.4 per cent of the voters. Only two and a half cantons opposed the reform, all of them ‘donor’ cantons.
         </p>
         
         <p>One of the many peculiarities of the Swiss political system is that the constitutional basis of the most important taxes of the federal state (direct federal tax and VAT) has to be renewed every once in a while since they are limited in time. On 28 November, the Swiss people had to decide about such an extension of the federal authorities’ mandate to levy taxes. The proposal was not controversial and was supported by the majority of political parties and cantons; thus resulting in an overwhelming ‘yes’ (73.8 per cent).</p>
         
         <p>The stem cell research law permits research on human embryonic stem cells while stipulating rules to prevent malpractice. The law was opposed by the Green Party and some religious groups. As on other occasions involving decisions about biotechnological issues, there was a rift between those who have faith in technological progress and those who do not. In the end, the progress‐friendly part of the population was in the majority: 66.4 percent of voters said ‘yes’ to the new law.</p>
