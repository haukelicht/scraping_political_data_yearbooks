         <p>The year 2013 was dominated by the lead up to the federal election which was eventually held on 7 September. It was also the year of the three Prime Ministers: Julia Gillard (Australia's first woman to hold that office), Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott.</p>

<p>Julia Gillard and her Labor Government ended the year as badly as they had begun it. Setback after setback in state/territory elections reinforced the message of bad federal opinion polls. Virtually no pundit was willing to give Labor a serious chance to win the election in September 2013.

            <p>Gillard was under pressure for the whole of 2011 and 2012, with her party always trailing badly in the opinion polls and virtually no one really expecting her to see out the year 2013 in office. The main question raised in the mind of observers was whether the Labor Party would allow her to lead it into the 2013 election, which was expected to be a landslide loss under her leadership.</p>
            
            <p>On Tuesday 22 January it was announced that Gillard had made what she called a ‘captain's pick’ for a safe seat in the Senate. The national executive of the Labor Party, acting on the urging of Gillard, announced that the party's leading Senate candidate in the Northern Territory would be former Olympian Nova Peris, an aboriginal and a woman. The Labor Party has always prided itself on being the party supported by Australia's indigenous population, but it had never had an aboriginal in the federal parliament. Through this move, Peris would become the first indigenous woman to be so distinguished and the news was largely well received by commentators.</p>
            
            <p>On Wednesday 30 January Gillard made an announcement that received less praise. In an address to the National Press Club in Canberra, she took the unusual step of announcing the next election date:
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Today I announce that later this year I shall advise the Governor‐General to dissolve the House of Representatives with the writs to be issued on Monday 12 August for an election for the House and half the Senate, to be held on Saturday 14 September. … This decision will free us up to govern. I do so not to start the nation's longest election campaign – quite the opposite. It should be clear to all which are the days of governing and which are the days of campaigning. (Gillard <span title=""><a href="#epdy12037-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12037-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>)</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
            
            
            <p>The reaction among commentators was largely negative. For the most part this was seen as Gillard trying to fend off a challenge by Kevin Rudd. Another criticism was that the day in question was Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. Yet another criticism was that the whole idea of a Prime Minister announcing an election date in that way was disrespectful to the Governor‐General since, under the Australian Constitution, it is actually the Governor‐General who dissolves the House of Representatives (though in practice this occurs on the advice of the Prime Minister.)</p>
            
            <p>It did not take long for speculation to develop that Rudd would again challenge Gillard and a formal challenge was expected on Thursday 21 March – except it did not happen. Rudd calculated that he did not have the numbers in the caucus and he promised never to challenge again.</p>
            
            <p>The federal budget was handed down by the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, on Tuesday 14 May. It forecast a record deficit for 2012–2013 of AUS$19.4 billion and AUS$18 billion for 2013–2014 with the promise of a return to surplus in 2015–2016. Economic growth was forecast to slow to 2.75 per cent in 2013–2014 before returning to 3 per cent in 2014–2015, as unemployment would fall from 5.5 to 5 per cent by 2015–2016. The carbon tax was forecast to fall from AUS$29 a tonne to AUS$12.10 in 2015–2016.</p>
            
            <p>Despite the relatively good economic news, Gillard remained unpopular, and by June Rudd was ready to try again to take her place. Those who opposed Gillard were aware that the final sitting week of the federal parliament before the scheduled election would come at the end of June, and that failure to act before the parliamentary term ended would secure Gillard's position as Prime Minister through to election day. Determined to avoid a Gillard‐led campaign that they expected to be disastrous, her opponents forced a challenge on the night of Wednesday 26 June and 57 members of the caucus voted for Rudd with only 45 for Gillard. She resigned as Prime Minister that night and on the morning of Thursday 27 June Rudd was sworn in by the Governor‐General, Quentin Bryce. The first thing Rudd did was to announce that he would not be bound to the idea that the election be held on 14 September.</p>
            
            <p>There was an immediate bounce in the polls for Labor to the point where several pundits started to predict a Labor win should Rudd follow through with Gillard's election pledge. Rudd further strengthened his position on Friday 19 July when he announced an agreement with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea (PNG), Peter O'Neill, whereby all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be sent to PNG for processing and resettlement – a step that would enable the Australian government to discourage asylum seekers by advertising to anyone arriving by boat that ‘you will never be given permanent residence in Australia’. That was a major deterrent and helped to neutralise the problem for Labor, though it did not silence the centre‐right entirely. Liberal and National party leaders promised that they would keep Rudd's ‘PNG Solution’, but would go one better by using the navy to turn boats back to Indonesia by force.</p>
            
            <p>On the afternoon of Sunday 4 August Rudd visited the Governor‐General to seek dissolution of the House of Representatives and an election day was announced for 7 September, one week earlier than Gillard had planned.</p>
            
            <p>The campaign itself was uneventful but marked by an erosion of the bounce that Labor had gained with Rudd's accession. Opinion poll results for Labor steadily deteriorated to the point that, in the final week of the campaign, no serious pundit was predicting a Labor win.</p>
            
            <p>In a previous commentary on the 2010 election I argued that:
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Under [Australia's] system of full preferential voting, a statement of first preference votes for the House of Representatives … sometimes does not give a meaningful interpretation of the popular vote [and] a much better guide is the so‐called ‘two‐party preferred vote’ which is counted out officially for information purposes. (Mackerras <span title=""><a href="#epdy12037-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12037-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 892)</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
            
            
            <p>In 2013, the two‐party preferred vote was as follows: 6,908,710 votes for the Liberal‐National coalition (53.5 per cent) and 6,006,217 votes for Labor (46.5 per cent). The swing away from Labor in 2013 was 3.6 per cent in comparison to 2010 and 6.2 per cent in comparison to 2007.</p>
            
            <p>Because the electoral system for the House of Representatives is based on single‐member constituencies, however, it lends itself to landslides and a relatively small swing in votes can shift a goodly number of seats. This is precisely what happened in 2013. Labor lost seats in five of the six states: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. In Victoria, however, Labor was still able to win a majority of the House seats as well as a majority of the two‐party preferred vote. While supporters of the incoming government were celebrating what they considered to be a landslide victory, the reality is that the victory of the Liberal‐National coalition under Tony Abbott was actually weaker than those of his predecessors who had taken the Liberal Party from the opposition benches into government. Robert Menzies (1949), Malcolm Fraser (1975) and John Howard (1996) all achieved victories more impressive than Abbott achieved in September 2013.</p>

            <p>If the Coalition's House of Representatives victory was not much to write home about, the same can be said with greater force about the Senate election. In that vote, the Coalition's percentage has fallen consistently over the years. Whereas the House system is non‐proportional the Senate system is semi‐proportional. Back in October 2004, the Liberal‐National coalition under John Howard was able to win a Senate majority with a share of 45.1 per cent, but these levels declined over time to 39.9 per cent in November 2007, 38.6 per cent in August 2010 and 37.7 per cent in September 2013 (and 37.0 per cent after adjustment of figures for the below‐mentioned April 2014 re‐vote in Western Australia).</p>
            
            <p>However, if the Coalition's performance was dismal, Labor's vote was abysmal. It appears that a substantial number of Australians dislike all of the Liberals, the Nationals, Labor and the Greens, and so prefer to vote for anyone else but these four main parties.</p>
            
            <p>In the Senate election, the most interesting state by far was Western Australia. Since senators do not take their seats for several months after election and, if defeated, continue to serve for several months after defeat, there is no hurry about declaring the election results. In early November, after an initial count, a ‘fresh scrutiny’ (or recheck of votes cast) and a ‘re‐count’, three Liberal senators were elected along with one each from Labor, the Greens and the Australian Sports Party. Due to the fact that 1,370 votes had been lost between the fresh scrutiny and the re‐count, a challenge was issued to the result in mid‐December, and in mid‐February 2014 the High Court (sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns) declared the result to be ‘absolutely void’. The ‘re‐election’ held on 5 April produced an identical result except for the substitution of the Sports Party senator by one from the Palmer United Party.</p>

         <p>Though both Gillard and Rudd were from the Labor Party, the cabinet of Rudd II differs significantly from Gillard I because a significant number of ministers under Gillard were so loyal to her that they refused to serve under Rudd. That explains why the cabinet of Rudd (Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12037-tbl-0004">2.2</a>) differs so greatly from that of Gillard (Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12037-tbl-0003">2.1</a>). Almost all the ministers who did not join the Rudd cabinet (including Gillard herself) announced that they would not be contesting the forthcoming election. In the case of Gillard, she indicated that she would not campaign for Labor but she intended ‘to give the party the gift of silence’.

         <p>The announcement of the Abbott cabinet on 16 September contained few surprises but excited the hostility of some commentators because of the relative absence of women. Whereas the Gillard I cabinet included four women, including Gillard herself, and the Rudd II cabinet included six women, the Abbott cabinet, by contrast, had only one woman out of 19 members: Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. One has to go back to the days of Menzies in 1949 to find a cabinet with so few women.</p>

         <p>The year 2013 did not see any formal institutional changes, but there were significant intra‐party changes even after the election. Kevin Rudd surrendered his leadership of Labor immediately upon his election loss. Two candidates emerged to lead Labor, both of whom had been ministers in the Gillard and Rudd governments: Anthony Albanese, representing the left and inner‐metropolitan working‐class seats in Sydney; and Bill Shorten, representing the party's right and its metropolitan seats in Melbourne. The result was announced on Sunday 13 October. Chris Bowen (also a minister in both Labor governments) had been interim leader.</p>
         
         <p>The situation was well summed up by Mark Kenny in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> under the heading ‘Shorten takes the reins’:
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Bill Shorten has promised to be ‘less relentlessly negative’ than Tony Abbott was as opposition leader but will not wave through the repeal of the pollution tax, setting up a showdown over carbon pricing within months. Mr Shorten, 46, was announced as Labor's 20<sup>th</sup> parliamentary leader on Sunday after an exhaustive double‐blind ballot of branch members and MPs, in which six out of 10 ordinary ALP members opted for Anthony Albanese. But Mr Shorten, who entered Parliament only in 2007, secured the bulk of the caucus votes which, under the two‐ballot system, were worth about 350 ordinary branch votes. (Kenny <span title=""><a href="#epdy12037-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12037-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>)</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>
         
         
         <p>The deputy leadership went to inner‐Sydney MP Tanya Plibersek of the left, giving cross‐factional, cross‐state and cross‐gender balance to the leadership.</p>
         
         <p>In 2013 the position of head of government changed in Victoria and the Northern Territory. In Victoria, the office of Premier changed from Ted Baillieu to Denis Napthine. In the Northern Territory, the office of Chief Minister changed from Terry Mills to Adam Giles. Giles is the first aborigine to head an Australia government. By a coincidence, the Liberal Party changed its leader in both jurisdictions in March.</p>

         <p>The new Liberal‐National government of Tony Abbott gave top priority to stopping the boats carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia. The government toughened a policy turning back boats, which was largely successful in achieving its goals, but which a former chief of Australia's defence force personnel noted could in some circumstances constitute piracy or provoke other international sanctions. Consequently, the first few months of the new government were characterised by no boats arriving in Australia. The policy offended Indonesia, but there was nothing the Indonesians could do about it except complain when Australian ships entered Indonesian waters.</p>
         
         <p>When the new Parliament (the 44<sup>th</sup>) first met on Tuesday 12 November, the government presented bills to repeal Labor's Clean Energy Future Legislation (known popularly as the ‘carbon tax’) and Labor's Minerals Resource Rent Tax (known popularly as the ‘mining tax’). However, given the lack of a Senate majority at the time (the 76‐strong Senate having 31 Labor and nine Greens Senators, making a total of 40) the government knew it would need to wait until July 2014 before it could succeed in its determination on repeal. On other less contentious legislation, the government relied on occasional Senate support from either Labor or the Greens.
