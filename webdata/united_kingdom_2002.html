         <p>The year 2003 saw the second round of elections for the devolved institutions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, local elections in Scotland and in parts of England, as well as a parliamentary by‐election. In the Scottish Parliament elections, the principal changes were a reduction in the number of Labour and Scottish National Party (SNP) seats and a growth in the number gained by the smaller parties. Both the Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party benefited from the Additional Member System (AMS), gaining seven and six seats, respectively. The losses for the SNP were a particular disappointment – although they gained two seats in the constituencies, they lost ten in the list results. Overall, the result meant that the executive in Scotland was unchanged – Labour continued to govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.</p>
         
         <p>In the Welsh Assembly elections, also held under AMS, Plaid Cymru suffered a similar fate to the SNP – both its vote share and seats total fell, leaving the party with five fewer seats in the new Assembly. By way of contrast, both Labour and the Conservatives made gains, allowing Labour to govern alone (albeit without an absolute majority), rather than alongside the Liberal Democrats as they had done in the previous session.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the Northern Ireland Assembly being suspended since the previous year, elections were held in November. The less consensual parties on each side of the divide made the principal gains, as in the 2001 general election. The Democratic Unionist Party gained 10 seats, making it the largest party in the Assembly. Sinn Fein also made six gains, making it the largest party on the nationalist side. The elections, held using the Single Transferable Vote, saw the previously dominant Ulster Unionist Party make a net loss of two seats and the Social Democratic and Labour Party lose six. However, despite the elections, the Assembly remained suspended.<a href="#t1%20#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The complex set‐up of local government in Britain saw elections in Metropolitan Boroughs, Shire Districts and Unitary Authorities in England, and Unitary Councils in Scotland. The Conservatives were the principal winners, gaining 31.5 per cent of the vote compared to 27.9 for Labour and 24.2 for the Liberal Democrats. This resulted in gains of approximately 660 seats for the Conservatives and 170 seats for the Liberal Democrats, while Labour lost approximately 880 seats and control of 36 councils. Liberal Democrats also made gains in local government by‐elections.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the by‐election in Brent East, caused by the death of the sitting Labour MP, saw Labour lose its first by‐election since coming to power in 1997. The victorious Liberal Democrat candidate saw her party come from third place in the 2001 general election, improving the party's share of the vote by 28.5 per cent. Labour's vote share fell by 29.4 per cent, but perhaps more tellingly, that of the Conservatives also fell by 2 per cent. Given that the party was placed a clear second in 2001, it might reasonably have expected to do better.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The parties</h2>
         
         <p>For all parties, the war in Iraq cast a shadow over activities. It had a particularly stark impact upon the governing party. While its performance in Scotland and Wales gave reason for cheer, the local government results were clearly disappointing. These problems were also reflected in the polls. Labour began the year with a mean eight‐point lead over the Conservatives. By July, the parties were neck and neck (on 36 per cent). Although by December, Labour had regained a four‐point lead, the standing on 38 per cent was below the party's election share and far lower than polls at this stage of the last Parliament. Nevertheless, Labour did at least succeed in not falling behind the opposition.</p>
         
         <p>The picture was less good for the Prime Minister: Blair was increasingly unpopular (despite a brief rally during the Iraq conflict). By June, his net approval rating was worse than that of Conservative leader, Iain Duncan‐Smith, and although his popularity improved a little towards the end of the year, he was the only party leader with a negative net rating (−19). Nevertheless, he remained the person most favoured to be Prime Minister, outscoring even the new Conservative leader. Satisfaction with the Government's record also worsened, reaching a net score of −43 in August, before settling on −31 by December, some five points worse than at the comparable point in 2002. On the upside, prospective economic evaluations improved throughout the year, suggesting some future electoral cheer for the governing party.</p>
         
         <p>Aside from the polls, Labour had to contend with a series of rebellions and high‐profile resignations throughout the year. Indeed, Labour MPs were rebelling more often than Government MPs in any postwar Parliament. In January, 45 backbenchers rebelled against plans to introduce foundation hospitals, while, in February, fully 121 Labour backbenchers voted against the Government over the case for war in Iraq. Then, in early March, Cabinet member Clare Short declared her intention to resign if the Government sanctioned military action in Iraq without a second resolution from the United Nations. Short did not carry out her threat, to subsequent derision. More seriously, on 17 March, the Leader of the House, former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, resigned from the Government over the impending war. In what was regarded as a landmark speech, his personal resignation statement received a standing ovation in the House of Commons. The following day, following a Commons debate on Iraq that lasted for over nine hours, 139 Labour MPs voted against the Government – the largest rebellion since that over the Corn Laws in the 1830s. Notwithstanding, the Government won the vote and the invasion of Iraq began two days later.</p>
         
         <p>In May, there were further sizeable rebellions, the largest being when 65 Labour backbenchers voted against the Health and Social Care bill. There was a further revolt on the bill in November when 62 rebelled. And despite the formal end to the conflict the previous month, Iraq continued to cause problems for the party. First, MP George Galloway was suspended from the party after complaints that the manner of his opposition to the war in Iraq had brought the party into disrepute. Among many comments made by the MP, he reportedly said in an interview with Abu Dhabi television that British troops should refuse to follow what he said were illegal orders. He was expelled from the party in October. The International Development Secretary, Claire Short, finally resigned from the Cabinet later in the month and became an outspoken critic of the party leadership.</p>
         
         <p>In June, there were further cabinet resignations. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine resigned as the Government was due to announce changes to the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary, and Health Secretary Alan Milburn resigned, in this case for family reasons. This prompted an earlier than expected Cabinet re‐shuffle. Leader of the House John Reid became Health Secretary. Welsh Secretary Peter Hain in turn replaced him. However, in recognition of the reduced importance of the Welsh role post‐devolution, Hain also retained the Welsh post. The same was true of the Scottish Secretary, with Transport Secretary, Alistair Darling, now taking over the dual role. In a further constitutional change, the Lord Chancellor's Department was abolished and replaced with a new Department of Constitutional Affairs. The new Secretary of State was Lord Falconer, though during the ‘transitional period’ he continued to be known as the ‘Lord Chancellor’.</p>
         
         <p>The question of rebellions re‐surfaced in July. Since devolution, the so‐called ‘West Lothian’ question had been unresolved. This refers to the fact that Scottish MPs may vote in the Commons on policy that affects England, but English MPs may not vote on any matters dealt with by the Scottish Parliament. As a consequence, the Conservatives claimed that the Government had only been able to pass legislation on foundation hospitals on account of the support of Scottish Labour MPs, whose constituents would be unaffected by the change (health being one of the policy areas devolved to the Scottish Parliament).</p>
         
         <p>Labour leader Tony Blair was unbowed by the difficulties, however. At the party's annual conference in September, he renewed his commitment to reform in the health service and university fees (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below), as well as the decision to go to war with Iraq. Although a rank‐and‐file revolt was predicted, none materialised. The Prime Minister's bullish mood was also in evidence in November, when he appointed two junior ministers to the party's National Executive Committee (NEC), passing over the expected appointment of Chancellor Gordon Brown. Finally, in December, the NEC, with the Prime Minister's support, voted to re‐admit London Mayor Ken Livingstone to the party. Livingstone had been expelled for standing against the official Labour candidate in the 2000 London mayoral election. The recommendation to re‐admit was made in advance of the 2004 mayoral election, despite Livingstone not having served the standard term of expulsion.
         </p>
         
         <p>Despite Labour's troubles, the Conservatives did not capitalise as much as they might have done. Notwithstanding good showings in the local and devolved elections, the party's poll ratings were not as impressive as the party might have hoped in the mid‐term of an increasingly unpopular Government. Despite drawing level with Labour in the summer, the party's mean poll rating did not exceed 36 per cent and no individual poll placed it above 38 per cent. The ratings for the party leader did, however, give some cause for cheer. While Iain Duncan‐Smith registered continual and worsening negative ratings, new leader Michael Howard registered the first positive net ratings for a Conservative leader since Duncan‐Smith had first become leader in 2001. Not only that, while more people thought Tony Blair was the best man to be Prime Minister, Howard's rating at the end of the year was only six points behind. For most of the year, Duncan‐Smith had trailed Blair on average by 18 points.</p>
         
         <p>Indeed, the issue of the party's leadership was the principal issue of concern throughout the year. In his New Year message, Iain Duncan‐Smith was prompted to flag the forthcoming local elections in May as a test of his leadership. By February, the leader was in trouble after having sacked some prominent staff at Conservative Central Office. He was forced to apologise over the matter to the backbench 1922 Committee. By May, the problems had worsened. The shadow trade minister, Crispin Blunt, resigned from the party's front bench and called for a leadership election. However, the party's credible performance in the local elections meant that the issue died down for the time being. By mid‐June, however, it re‐surfaced. The party's treasurer, Sir Stanley Kalms, resigned after a series of rows with Iain Duncan‐Smith over staff changes at Conservative Central Office, and in early July, the leader was condemned by the candidate whom he beat for the leadership, Kenneth Clarke, for making the party unelectable by attempting to force Britain out of the European Union (EU). This attack was made only hours before a high‐profile speech by the leader in Prague opposing the single currency. Internal party feuding continued over the summer and by late September, former Conservative deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine publicly declared that the party could not win the next general election.</p>
         
         <p>Not surprisingly, the party's conference in early October was overshadowed by speculation about the leader's future. And, to add insult to injury, claims were made that Duncan‐Smith had made improper salary payments to his wife (the allegations were later rejected by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner). Despite a bullish performance from Duncan‐Smith at the conference, a prominent party donor, Stuart Wheeler, called for his removal. And, indeed, he did resign at the end of October, following a vote of no confidence among the party's MPs. As a result, the party prepared for its sixth leadership election since 1989, and the third since losing power in 1997. In the end, there was no formal election as there was only one candidate nominated: Michael Howard. Thus, despite having enfranchised party members for the first time in the election of Duncan‐Smith, the rank‐and‐file were denied the opportunity to vote on this occasion. Howard's election as party leader was closely followed by the announcement by former leadership hopeful Michael Portillo that he would stand down at the next election.</p>
         
         <p>The new leader was swift to make his mark on the party. He sacked Theresa May as party chairwoman and announced a new ‘slimline’ shadow cabinet. The previous shadow cabinet had 26 members, the new one, with a number of shared roles, had 12. Later in November, the party engaged in a novel form of candidate selection. In the constituency of Warrington South, the Conservative candidate was selected on the basis of a ‘primary’ election – open to all constituents on the electoral register. It was a device to encourage local Conservative Associations to select fewer white, middle‐aged men as candidates.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberal Democrats also failed to make as many inroads as the party might have hoped. Despite a more sceptical tone on the Iraq War, the party did not make much progress in the polls. Beginning the year at 23 per cent, it ended it on 21 per cent, having reached a peak of 25 per cent in September. Charles Kennedy was by far the most popular leader, but his net positive score at the end of the year (+19) was actually three points lower than that at the beginning. Indeed, the middle of the year saw his ratings take a fall (down to +6 in September). His ratings as best person to be prime minister also declined. Beginning the year on 31 per cent (just two points behind Blair and some 16 ahead of Iain Duncan‐Smith), he finished the year on +13.</p>
         
         <p>The far‐right British National Party (BNP) again made some electoral gains. In the May local elections, the party won 11 seats, including seven in Burnley, making it the largest opposition party in the City Council. In September, the party won its eighteenth United Kingdom council seat in a by‐election in Essex. However, in a by‐election in the same month (caused by the resignation of one of the new BNP Councillors in Burnley following a brawl), the BNP was defeated by the Liberal Democrats.</p>

         <p>The war in Iraq dominated national politics throughout the year. In January, Britain signalled its willingness to stand aside from some of its key EU partners when it signed a statement supporting the United States’ stance on Iraq. This initiative, co‐signed by Spain, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic was taken without consultation with either France or Germany and came only days after EU foreign ministers had agreed upon a policy of peaceful diplomacy. Early in February, the Prime Minister declared his intention to disarm by force if Iraq rejected the ‘peaceful route’. The Conservatives supported the PM's stance, while the Liberal Democrat leader argued that the case for war was not yet proven. The situation intensified that month with Chief Weapons Inspector Hans Blix informing the United Nations Security Council that many proscribed weapons were still unaccounted for in Iraq. While France, Germany and Russia argued that inspectors should be given more time, Britain and the United States asserted the case for war. This was followed on 15 February by the biggest peace rally in British history, when many hundreds of thousands of anti‐war protesters marched through London. By early March, the Attorney General advised the Government that the use of armed force against Iraq was legal and the invasion began on 20 March. By 14 April, Tony Blair declared victory.</p>
         
         <p>British public opinion on the war changed rapidly once the invasion had begun. In polls from the previous August up until just before the invasion, the proportion disapproving of military action had always been higher than those approving, though there was a sizeable proportion not expressing a firm opinion. Post‐invasion, however, significantly more people expressed approval. By the end of the war, 63 per cent were in favour of military action and 23 per cent were opposed. In the months that followed, when asked whether military action was justified to remove Saddam Hussein opinion was, with the exception of one month (September), consistently positive.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the military victory, the issue of Iraq did not disappear. On 22 May, the United Nations declared that the United States and Britain had international legal backing for the occupation of Iraq. However, in a report broadcast a week later, a BBC journalist (Andrew Gilligan) claimed that the Government had exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq in order to strengthen the case for war. This claim provoked a huge political controversy, particularly after the same journalist in a hearing before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, repeated his allegations and claimed that the source of his story was a senior official. The claims of deception were robustly denied by the Government's director of communications, Alistair Campbell, days later in the same select committee, and he demanded that the BBC apologise. This led the BBC (as it turned out, somewhat hastily) to issue a statement supporting the journalist. By early July, the source of Gilligan's story was revealed as Dr David Kelly, who was subsequently summoned to give evidence to the select committee. Three days later, Kelly was found dead, having committed suicide. In the subsequent furore, it was announced that a public inquiry would be set up to investigate the circumstances leading up to Dr Kelly's death. It was to be chaired by Lord Hutton and commenced on 1 August. Both the Defence Secretary and the Prime Minister appeared before the inquiry, as well as Gilligan and Andrew Campbell. In Gilligan's evidence, he admitted to misreporting the views conveyed to him by Kelly. When the inquiry reported in January 2004, the Government was cleared of any wrongdoing and the BBC criticised. It led to the resignation of the Chairman and Director‐General and, ultimately, Gilligan.</p>
         
         <p>Aside from Iraq, the Government's piecemeal programme of constitutional reform continued, though not entirely smoothly. In February, the Prime Minister's preferred option of a wholly appointed second chamber was defeated in a Commons vote. Indeed, the Commons was unable to agree on any of the options put forward by the Joint Select Committee on Lords Reform. In May, the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act received royal assent. This provided for the holding of referendums on the establishment of elected regional assemblies in England, and shortly after receiving assent, the Deputy Prime Minister announced plans to hold such referendums in the North‐East, North‐West, and Yorkshire and the Humber in 2004. May also saw the passing of the European Parliament (Representation) Act, which allowed Gibraltar to become part of a United Kingdom region (the South‐West) for elections to the European Parliament. In June, the Lord Chancellor's Department was abolished and replaced by a new Department for Constitutional Affairs. Proposed substantive changes included the creation of a Supreme Court, separate from Parliament, to replace the House of Lords as the highest court of appeal. In September, further proposals from the new department included legislation to exclude the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the House of Lords, a commission to oversee and select appointments to the Lords and legislation to enable the expulsion of convicted peers.</p>
         
         <p>Following reform in the health service, higher education became the next domestic policy battleground. Government proposals included introducing so‐called student ‘top‐up’ fees of up to £3,000 per annum. The policy was to prove unpopular with many Labour MPs who argued that the proposed variability in fees between both universities and courses would discriminate against some students. The Government pressed on, announcing its intention to replace up‐front fees (of around £1,000) with the new ‘top‐up’ fees (payable after graduation) in the Queen's Speech. In other areas of note, the Chancellor announced in June that the so‐called ‘five economic tests’ for United Kingdom membership of the euro had not yet been passed. Thus, while the intention to hold a referendum on the issue was included in the Queen's Speech, the caveat of the five economic tests remained, suggesting that a referendum would be unlikely to occur before the next general election. Such a policy chimed with public opinion, where opposition to membership appeared, if anything, to grow stronger. By December, fully 66 per cent claimed that they would vote against membership in a referendum.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the political difficulties in Northern Ireland continued. In January, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble made the official disbanding of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) a prerequisite for the resumption of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suspended since October 2002. The continuing deadlock saw the passing of the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections Act in March, which allowed for the postponement of elections. Despite the war in Iraq, the Prime Minister continued to try to break the deadlock. At a March summit in Northern Ireland with the American President, he found time to issue a joint statement with Irish premier Bertie Ahern calling for an end to all paramilitary activity – a statement endorsed by President Bush. However, the continuing failure of the IRA to declare an unequivocal end to paramilitary activities by May saw an official postponement of elections. In June, David Trimble won a narrow victory from his party to endorse the negotiated settlement laid out by the London and Dublin governments, but at a cost – three Ulster Unionist MPs reassigned the party whip in protest. Voters did finally go to the polls in November, but the Assembly remained suspended after the anti‐Good Friday Agreement Democratic Unionist Party performed so well.</p>
