         <p>British politics in 2010 was dominated by a general election campaign that effectively began early in the year, and the subsequent formation of the first coalition government in the United Kingdom since the Second World War. Debates about how best to deal with the continuing economic malaise featured heavily throughout the year. The election campaign had seen the first televised leaders' debates in Britain, out of which Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg emerged with a much higher profile but only a modest increase in vote share for his party. Once the novelty of putting together a coalition administration had worn off, attention in the second half of 2010 focused on the Government's programme of spending cuts and constitutional reform as well as the Labour Party leadership election. The year came to an end with a controversial decision to allow university tuition fees to be raised to £9,000, and Vince Cable finding himself in hot water after undercover journalists recorded him discussing his importance within the coalition and his views of Rupert Murdoch.</p>
         
         <p>The year began with the re‐appearance of a theme from 2009 (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Whitaker 2010</a></span>): attempts to oust Gordon Brown from office. On 6 January, two former cabinet ministers, Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt, called for a secret ballot on the leadership of the Labour Party. Although Foreign Secretary David Miliband's support for Brown was rather tardy and lukewarm, Hoon and Hewitt's campaign failed to gather sufficient momentum for a ballot to go ahead. This was an inauspicious start to the year for the Prime Minister, but a Populus poll in <i>The Times</i>, a week later showed his ratings to be on the increase.
         </p>
         
         <p>While the economy came out of recession in the final quarter of 2009, questions of how to reduce public spending were to dominate the political agenda in the opening months of 2010. Economic conditions remained fragile with slightly lower growth in the first three months of the year compared with the last quarter of 2009. In his final budget, on 24 March, Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling predicted growth of 1–1.25 per cent for 2010 and lowered the forecast for economic expansion in 2011. His attempts to stimulate economic activity included cuts in business rates for one year and dropping stamp duty for homes up to £250,000 for first‐time buyers for two years. In April, Office for National Statistics figures showed government borrowing at a record high of £163.4 billion for the 2009/2010 financial year. The second quarter of 2010 saw unexpectedly high economic growth of 1.2 per cent, but the economy was to contract again in the final quarter.</p>
         
         <p>The expenses scandal, which had been a major theme in 2009 (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Whitaker 2010</a></span>), continued to make headlines with the publication in February of Sir Thomas Legg's report on MPs' expenses. The report required £1.12 million of repayments of claims made on second homes – a figure lower than it would have been in the absence of appeals made by parliamentarians. February also saw the announcement that three Labour MPs (Elliot Morley, Jim Devine and David Chaytor) and one Conservative peer (Lord Hanningfield) would be charged with false accounting over their expenses claims. Labour removed the whip from the three MPs as did the Conservatives from Lord Hanningfield. Chaytor pleaded guilty to three counts of false accounting in December, but trials for the others did not take place until 2011.
         </p>
         
         <p>Campaigning for the election began early in the year with the publication on 4 January of a Conservative draft manifesto on health policy alongside a poster campaign stating that the National Health Service would be the party's ‘number one priority’. Labour responded with the publication <i>Conservative Tax and Spending Policies</i> setting out an alleged £34 billion gap in Conservative spending plans. In early February, Brown attempted to gain the initiative on constitutional reform by saying he would introduce legislation before the election allowing a referendum on the alternative vote (AV) system for elections to Westminster seats. This was to remain on the political agenda well into 2011, having been taken on as part of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement (discussed below). Later in February Brown launched Labour's campaign themes under the slogan ‘A future fair for all’, but this was to be over‐shadowed by the publication of <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Andrew Rawnsley's (2010</a></span>) book, <i>The End of the Party</i>, which included allegations that Brown had behaved abusively towards staff. Despite this, the earlier attempt to oust Brown and the charging of three Labour MPs over expenses, the gap between the two main parties in the polls broadly declined over the opening months of the year, with several polls in February showing only a six‐point lead for the Conservatives, which was not enough to ensure a majority in Parliament. Polling data also showed Cameron's lead over Brown having halved in the five months up to February (<a href="http://www.politicshome.com" class="linkBehavior">http://www.politicshome.com</a>, 19 February 2010).
         </p>
         
         <p>On 6 April, Gordon Brown called an election for 6 May. The first week of the official campaign was dominated by discussion of Labour's planned increase in national insurance payments, its merits as a way of raising government revenue and its potential effect on jobs. The second week saw the main parties launching their manifestos. Labour's document, ‘A future fair for all’, concentrated on three themes: rebuilding the economy, protecting public services and strengthening society, and ‘a new politics’. On the first of these, Labour promised to reduce the government deficit by more than half over four years but not to begin cuts until 2011/2012 – a crucial difference from the Conservative position. On the second theme, ‘frontline spending’ on childcare, schools, the NHS and police would be protected from cuts, and public services were to become more personalised. On ‘new politics’, in addition to a referendum on AV, Labour promised fixed‐term parliaments and moves towards a written constitution.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservative manifesto was billed as an ‘Invitation to join the government of Britain’, based around the theme of moving from big government to ‘the Big Society’. The latter included ideas about empowering citizens and their communities, and encouraging greater social responsibility. For instance, parents would be able to set up schools, local residents could take over the running of libraries and the police should be more accountable to citizens. The ‘Big Society’ proved hard to sell and was to feature less prominently as the campaign proceeded. On the economy, the party promised to increase spending on health annually in real terms and to maintain spending commitments on international development. At the same time they would immediately begin cutting public spending overall with the aim of removing ‘the bulk’ of the deficit before the next election. On reform of politics, the Conservatives promised to cut the number of MPs, make constituency sizes more equal, introduce recall of MPs convicted of wrongdoing and retain the first‐past‐the‐post electoral system. Other themes included a commitment to protect the environment, and a policy towards the European Union (EU) based on referenda over any further transfer of powers alongside legislation explicitly setting out the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberal Democrats' manifesto, under the title ‘Change that works for you’, set out their plans under four headings: fair taxes, a fair chance for every child, a fair future (creating jobs with a green economy) and a fair deal, based on reform of politics. On the first of these, the party promised to raise the threshold on which income tax is levied to £10,000, paid for partly by a tax on properties worth more than £2 million, quickly dubbed a ‘mansion tax’ by parts of the media. They set out plans to cut government spending, like Labour, from 2011/2012 rather than immediately after an election. They chose not to protect the budgets of any particular departments but said they had no plans to make net cuts in frontline NHS spending. Their ‘fair chance for every child’ promised financial support for the most disadvantaged school children. On the third theme they set out a green stimulus plan to create 100,000 jobs. On political reform they promised the single transferable vote (STV) for Westminster elections, and, as did the Conservatives, cuts to the number of MPs and a recall system for MPs found to have engaged in ‘serious wrongdoing’. Like Labour, they also promised fixed‐term parliaments.</p>
         
         <p>Differences between the three main parties were therefore mainly about when to begin spending cuts, how far they should go and how much protection should be afforded to specific public services.</p>
         
         <p>Much of the election campaign that followed was dominated by the three televised leaders' debates which took place weekly from the 15 April. The first of these was the most talked about as, unexpectedly, Nick Clegg was the clear winner in terms of his performance, dealing more comfortably with the format, at least initially, than Cameron. The associated surge in support for the Liberal Democrats shown in opinion polls was not reflected in the election result but the profile of the party and its leader rose, affecting the tone of the following two debates, with much more media attention having been given to the Liberal Democrats' policies and to Clegg himself. The content of the debates focused mainly on domestic policy (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Allen et al. 2011</a></span>), which fitted with the salience of the economy during the election campaign. A day before the final debate, Brown was to find himself in the news for all the wrong reasons. The Prime Minister was recorded, via a microphone accidentally left on, describing a woman he had just met during a visit to Rochdale as ‘bigoted’ on the basis of remarks she made about immigrants. While he attempted to brush this off in the final debate, opinion polls showed him in third place in all three leaders' debates.
         </p>
         
         <p>The results of the election, in which no main party achieved an overall majority, were something of a mixed bag for all three of them. The Conservatives managed a 3.7‐point increase in vote share and achieved a net gain of 96 seats, making them the largest party but short of a majority by 20 seats. Labour made a net loss of 90 seats and dropped 6.2 points in vote share. The Liberal Democrats gained a point in share of the vote, but made a net loss of five seats, which was particularly disappointing for them, especially after their polling figures had soared earlier in the campaign. After the three main parties, the United Kingdom Independence Party was next with 3.1 per cent of the vote – the highest score for a fourth‐placed party since 1950, and roughly one point up on its vote share at the previous general election. This did not translate into any seats in Parliament, but the Green Party, with much more geographically concentrated support, won their first seat with a victory in the constituency of Brighton Pavilion. The radical right British National Party (BNP) also managed to increase their vote share by 1.2 points to 1.9 per cent but without winning a seat. The share of the vote for parties other than the main three was the highest in Great Britain since the nineteenth century (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Curtice 2010</a></span>: 627), reflecting changes in the party system.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Northern Ireland the most dramatic result was that of Peter Robinson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), losing his seat along with a decline of nearly nine points in vote share for the party. The DUP's loss was to be the non‐sectarian Alliance Party's gain. The alliance between the Ulster Unionists and Conservatives, known as ‘Ulster Conservatives and Unionists New Force’, failed to win a seat, as did the Traditional Unionist Voice – a breakaway group from the DUP. Sinn Féin moved into first place but, along with the Social Democratic and Labour Party, maintained its number of seats. A further seat was won by Lady Sylvia Hermon, an independent and former Ulster Unionist MP.</p>
         
         <p>It took five days from 7 May for the first coalition government in the United Kingdom since 1945 to be put together. The day after the election saw talks begin between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. By 10 May Gordon Brown announced he would resign as Labour Party leader and the Conservatives offered a coalition to the Liberal Democrats. The following evening, Brown resigned as Prime Minister and the agreement of a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition became public. The Liberal Democrats were perceived to have done well out of the deal, achieving the Cabinet posts of Deputy Prime Minister, Secretaries of State for Business, Energy and Climate Change, and Scotland, as well as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In policy terms, both parties succeeded in areas that were of importance to them, although cutting the deficit was to take priority over all other measures, reflecting the Conservatives' concern to begin reducing government expenditure as soon as practicable. The Liberal Democrats gained a referendum on a change to the AV system for Westminster elections, while the Conservatives ensured that reducing the deficit, a tough immigration policy, Euroscepticism and strong defence were part of the agreement, although there were modifications and some dilution of the position on relations with the European Union (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Quinn et al. 2011</a></span>). The first opinion polls taken after the new government was formed showed a slight drop in support for the Liberal Democrats – something that was to continue through the rest of the year – and a rise in support for Labour, with the Conservatives remaining static.
         </p>
         
         <p>The coalition was rocked early in its life by the resignation on 29 May of David Laws, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, a Liberal Democrat and one of the key players in brokering the coalition deal (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Laws 2010</a></span>). The expenses saga had reared its head again as Laws admitted having claimed £40,000 in rent, paid to his partner. But life for the coalition went on with an emergency budget on 22 June. Value Added Tax was to rise from 17.5 to 20 per cent and spending was to be cut with measures including a two‐year freeze on public sector pay, a three‐year freeze in child benefit and reduced tax credits for families earning more than £40,000. A £1,000 rise in the income tax threshold was also promised. Details of how public expenditure would be cut were set out in the Government's Spending Review in October. This established that a little under half a million public sector jobs would go in the period up to 2015 along with average spending cuts per department of 19 per cent. The Government stuck to the Conservative promise of increased expenditure on health while funding to the police was to be cut by 4 per cent per year.
         </p>
         
         <p>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg set out the Government's proposals for constitutional reform in July, including plans for a referendum on 5 May 2011 on changing the voting system for Westminster elections to AV, a review of constituency boundaries and corresponding reduction in the number of MPs to 600, and the introduction of fixed‐term parliaments. By the end of the year, the Fixed Term Parliaments Bill had completed its committee stage in the Commons while the legislation providing for a referendum on AV and a reduction in the number of MPs had passed through the Commons and started what was to be a lengthy period of scrutiny in the upper chamber.</p>
         
         <p>While the opposition among Government backbenchers to these constitutional bills was limited, the Government was to experience a much bumpier ride when Parliament passed legislation in early December to raise the cap on university tuition fees to £9,000 per year. The vote had been preceded by major protests in several cities across Britain, including sit‐ins by students on university premises. It was particularly difficult for the Liberal Democrats as all of their MPs had signed a pledge, prior to the election, promising not to increase tuition fees in the next Parliament – something that was also promised in their manifesto. However, the Government agreed to a policy of increasing the cap, on the basis of recommendations in the Browne Report on the future of higher education in England, set up under the previous government and published in October. The Government's majority was cut to 21, with 21 Liberal Democrat MPs (37 per cent) voting against the motion – the largest rebellion against the leadership in the party's history. By the end of the year, and no doubt partly related to this, the Liberal Democrats were scoring around 9–11 per cent in most polls, around half the level of support they were receiving just prior to the general election.</p>
         
         <p>The second half of the year also saw a Labour Party leadership election. For much of the campaign, which ran from June to September, David Miliband, towards the right of his party and a Foreign Secretary in Gordon Brown's Government, was expected to win. Under the alternative vote system used for the election, he was ahead until the final round of re‐distributing preferences, at which point his brother Ed, perceived to be more left‐wing, won by a small margin. This surprising result saw David Miliband leaving frontline British politics, fearing that taking a place in Ed's shadow cabinet would lead to frequent media speculation about differences between the brothers. Ed Miliband supported cutting the deficit but more slowly than proposed by the Government, promised to make his the party of enterprise and small business, favoured a ‘living wage’ and declared his opposition to the Iraq War, promising foreign policy based on values, not just alliances. As 2010 came to an end, Labour were scoring around 39–41 per cent in opinion polls, many of which gave them a lead of around two points over the Conservatives. Much of Labour's gain had been at the expense of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
         
         <p>On foreign policy, in July the Government stated its aim that, by 2014, British troops should operate only in a training capacity in Afghanistan. They also published a National Security Strategy on 19 October setting out major threats including cyber attack and terrorism. This was followed by publication of the Strategic Defence and Security Review which established plans for an 8 per cent cut in defence spending over four years, involving the loss of 42,000 jobs in the Ministry of Defence and armed services over the same period.</p>
         
         <p>In Scottish developments, legislation implementing many of the recommendations of the Calman Commission (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Whitaker 2010</a></span>: 1198) began its passage through Westminster in late November. This would give the Scottish Executive a smaller budget from London but much more power to set income tax rates, with the aim of increasing the Executive's accountability to Scottish voters. The bill would also devolve powers to Scotland in a number of new areas, including speed limits and drink‐driving laws.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Wales, the National Assembly passed a motion in February that eventually led to a referendum in 2011 on granting direct legislative powers to the Assembly.</p>
         
         <p>In Northern Ireland, First Minister Peter Robinson stood down from his post for six weeks from 11 January following allegations about his wife's private life and the couple's financial affairs. He returned in February after an enquiry found no evidence he had departed from the ministerial code. The same month also saw an announcement that the Irish National Liberation Army, the Official Irish Republican Army and the Ulster Defence Association had decommissioned their weapons. After a long and difficult process of reaching agreement among the parties, policing and justice powers were devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 12 April with the Alliance party leader, David Ford, taking up the relevant ministerial post. On 15 June, the report of the Saville Inquiry into ‘Bloody Sunday’ (30 January 1972), when British soldiers killed a number of civilians in Derry/Londonderry, was finally published after more than a decade of investigation. The findings, which indicated that those killed were unarmed, led David Cameron to issue a formal apology for the deaths.</p>

         <p>The coalition government created a new Office for Budgetary Responsibility in May, the role of which is to provide independent analysis of the United Kingdom's economy and public finances, and to measure how far the government is meeting its fiscal aims. Changes to the standing orders of the House of Commons in March allowed, for the first time, the election by secret ballot of the chairs and members of select committees. The aim was to reduce the power of party whips over the membership of these committees and therefore increase their independence from government. Elections to the committees took place in June when the Commons also changed its rules to allow the establishment of a Backbench Business Committee, which was elected by the end of the month. This has responsibility for scheduling non‐government business, including legislation and debates, on 35 days a year.</p>
