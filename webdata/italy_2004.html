         <p>Regional elections, referenda on medically assisted fertilisation, a reshuffle of government and centre‐right unrest, primaries for the centre‐left candidate for prime minister, reform of the constitution and of the electoral law, Iraq, economic stagnation, a crisis of the governorship of the Bank of Italy and raiders' activity in the stock market were the main issues of Italian politics in 2005.</p>
         
         <p>On the electoral scene, the most crucial event concerned the regional elections, held on 3–4 April. That confrontation was seen as the last and most probing test before the general elections called for 2006, since 14 regions out of 20 were affected by the vote on the same day (plus two more, albeit minor, regions in the fall). The centre‐right government coalition contested the elections with the same format with which it had contested the 2001 general elections since it had not experienced any changes in its composition. Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Fini's Alleanza Nazionale, Bossi's Lega Nord and Casini's minor Catholic party, the UDC, still made up the centre‐right offer. On the other side, the landscape of the centre‐left was more diversified and somewhat different compared to 2001. The debate on the creation of a unified party encompassing the DS, the Daisy, and the minuscule socialists and republicans continued to attract the attention of the media – to the discomfort of the centre‐left voters. The universally recognised leader of the centre‐left, Romano Prodi (who was no longer a member of any party), pushed for the establishment of a ‘new, reformist party’– sometimes identified as ‘democratic party’– while the leaders of the major formations (DS and above all Daisy) were less enthusiastic about such a radical transformation and tended to downgrade the alliance to an electoral cartel. Actually, Romano Prodi felt himself quite isolated in advocating a radical transformation of the partisan alignments on the left.</p>
         
         <p>The stronger resistance arose from the Daisy, a party that had also originated as a Prodi initiative before he moved on to the presidency of the European Commission in 1999. The leader of the Daisy, Francesco Rutelli, was quite tough in pinpointing the need of his own party to reinforce itself before and beyond moving into a new, larger organisation together with the (strong) DS. This organisational defence was supplanted by an emphasis on the Catholic imprint of the party, contrary to the secular alignment of the DS. This confessional character represented a subtle and intriguing challenge for Prodi himself, given his profound Catholic roots. The Daisy's resistance towards a new party – a resistance that was also present in the DS, but with much less intensity – inhibited the presentation of a common list of the Olive Tree (comprising DS, Daisy, socialists and republicans) in every region at the regional elections; after a long ‘<i>bras de fer</i>’, Prodi obtained the presentation of the common list in 9 regions out of 14.
         </p>
         
         <p>The regional electoral system provides two ballots: one for the direct election (first‐past‐the‐post) of the region's president, and one for the regional council using a PR with bonus party list system. Given the power of the president, the first vote is by far the more important. In 12 out of 14 regions, the centre‐left won the presidency, conquering six more regions compared to the 2000 elections. This landslide victory did not entail, however, a dramatic increase in votes as far as the party lists were concerned. Within the centre‐left, the common list called ‘United in the Olive Tree’ (‘Uniti nell'Ulivo’) (DS, Daisy, socialists and republicans) was presented in nine regions, whereas those parties competed separately in the other five. Their increase compared to the previous regional elections was similar (+3.1 per cent) whether they competed united or separately. The endless debate on the efficacy/profitability of a common list did not find a final answer. On the other side, Forza Italia suffered a blow, losing more than 8 percentage points and AN also lost, while the more centrist UDC doubled its share of the votes with a spectacular increase in the south.</p>
         
         <p>The negative electoral result of the centre‐right ignited a confrontation between Berlusconi (flanked by Bossi's Lega) on the one side, and the other two parties (AN and UDC) on the other. The latter advocated for a ‘sign of discontinuity’ in the government composition and activity in order to counteract the opposition advance. Their criticism concerned the excessive role granted to the Lega Nord by the prime minister himself: this imbalance towards extremist, xenophobic and anti‐European positions was considered one of the reasons for the electoral defeat. Berlusconi resisted for a while, but in the face of the resignation of the UDC ministers resigned himself on 20 April. The Berlusconi III government was little more than a reshuffle and the internal balance of power within the coalition did not change much: in the new government AN had more voice thanks to a shrinking of the Forza Italia ministries. Actually, Berlusconi proved once again quite capable in managing a critical occurrence. Even the sudden resignation of the powerful Minister of Economics in September was overcome with haste.</p>
         
         <p>The second electoral contest of the year concerned a series of four abrogative referenda on medically assisted fertilisation. The law passed in 2004 was quite restrictive: thus the DS and other secular parties and voluntary organisations collected signatures calling for an abrogative referendum. The question was quite divisive for the centre‐left since a large part of the Daisy supported the law and opposed its abrogation, in contrast to the DS. Quite surprisingly, even in the centre‐right, some fissures emerged: the (female) Minister of Equal Opportunity and, above all, AN leader Gianfranco Fini declared their opposition to the law in favour of a more liberal approach. Fini's position raised an enormous noise, and for the first time he was openly challenged within his own party, which had attentively cultivated good relations with the Catholic hierarchy over all those years. The electoral campaign was not centred on the law itself since the tool adopted by the supporters of the present law played on abstention: in Italy, a referendum is invalid when less than 50 per cent +1 go to the polls. The Church – whose intervention in the political domain was quite invasive – praised abstention, and all its political supporters followed. Actually, in line with the turnout of the previous referenda in the last decade, only a quarter of electors voted, thus nullifying the attempt to cancel the law. This ‘ethical’ issue heightened the tension between the Catholic hierarchy and the secular component of the centre‐left; and even a well‐known Catholic such as Prodi was under attack for his attempt to defend the distinction between politics and religion. Other ethical issues, such as the legal recognition of same‐sex unions, got attention in the political domain and reproduced the same cleavage exhibited on the issue of medically assisted fertilisation, but they were finally left aside by the centre‐left notwithstanding the repeated attempts by the centre‐right to revive them.</p>
         
         <p>The landmark success of the centre‐left in the regional elections reduced the internal tensions between Prodi and the major parties on the one side, and among the various partners of the coalition on the other. In particular, the unexpected victory in the Apulia region of the radical candidate from Rifondazione comunista (Communist Refoundation), who had previously unaccountably defeated the more moderate Daisy‐sponsored candidate in the regional primaries inside the centre‐left, finally provided Rifondazione with the recognition of its positive role that it had long been looking for; on the same track, Rifondazione's national congress had (not without dissent, however) diluted its more radical positions, following the more pragmatic approach of its leader, Fausto Bertinotti.</p>
         
         <p>The aftermath of regional elections convinced Prodi of the uselessness of a primary for his investiture as the centre‐left candidate for the upcoming general elections. In the summer, however, the refusal of the main parties to proceed with the definition of a common list for the general elections brought the question again to the fore and finally the primaries were held on 16 October. Prodi was challenged by Bertinotti on his left and by Clemente Mastella, leader of the tiny and moderate UDEUR, on his right. Prodi, supported by the main parties, collected 74.1 per cent of the votes, but the impact of that event was the unexplained and amazing number of people who participated in this self‐administered, while rigorous, internal competition. Notwithstanding that people had to present themselves with their electoral certificates at the polling stations previously indicated by the organisers on the basis of their residence and pay at least €1 in order to vote, more than four million people went to the polls (4,273,832). The primaries expressed a tremendously widespread desire, or need, to participate, and ultimately crowned Prodi as leader of the centre‐left.</p>
         
         <p>On the economic side, the expectations of an economic recovery were nullified by the collapse in industrial production, in the export rate and in productivity, and by a steep increase in public‐sector expenditures. Prime Minister Berlusconi insisted on promoting a radical tax cut, but the Minister of the Economy stopped him because of the critical balance of state finances and allowed only a minimal reduction that had no impact at all, either on the economy or on the government's image. At the end of the year, GNP growth went to zero and, for the first time since 1992, the public debt increased.</p>
         
         <p>This disastrous performance of the economy was, in a way, ‘accompanied’ by the crisis of credibility of the Bank of Italy. The central bank had the reputation of a very rigorous, efficient and high‐profile institution. The highly respected President of the Republic and former Prime Minister and Treasury Minister, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, had long been the governor of the Bank of Italy. The present governor, Antonio Fazio, had been under attack by one of Berlusconi's Economics Ministers, Giulio Tremonti, for carelessness in the Parmalat and Cirio default and in the circulation of their treasury bonds among the banks' clients. Fazio resisted these attacks for a long time, but in the summer a series of intertwined financial ‘affairs’ revealed that Fazio's involvement went well beyond his institutional role. The crucial affair concerned the sponsorship Fazio granted to a medium‐sized banker (Giampiero Fiorani, head of the Banca Popolare di Lodi) for his strategy of expansion (along with which the incorporation of the failed bank of the Lega Nord must be included) and above all for his contrasting activity in opposition to the attempted take‐over by the Dutch bank Abn Amro of the Italian bank Antonveneta. In the same period, the same kind of activity was carried on by the insurance company, Unipol, against the Bilbao bank, which was trying to buy the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. In the latter case, Fazio was less directly involved, but he supported Fiorani's initiatives to an extent well beyond that appropriate to his role as governor of the Bank of Italy.</p>
         
         <p>The magistrates once more moved before the political class had acted. In July, their investigation revealed Fazio's inappropriate interventions in support of Fiorani and, at the same time, a nested network of relationships among finance tycoons and construction entrepreneurs willing to control – or distort – the finance market and buy the influential, leading Italian newspaper,<i> Corriere della Sera</i>. By the end of the year, Fiorani was put into jail and confessed to, among other things, appalling bribery against the interests of his bank's ordinary clients; the tycoons' raids stopped, the Unipol chief executive officer and his deputy were forced to resign; and finally Fazio himself resigned (the comeback of Tremonti as Minister of Economics in September favoured that outcome). These events, which captured the public's attention for many months, affected both the centre‐right and the centre‐left. While Fiorani and other tycoons were clearly linked to the centre‐right, Unipol was the insurance company of the cooperative movement, traditionally strictly linked to the left and to the DS in particular.
         </p>
         
         <p>The presence of Italian troops in Iraq continued to be at the forefront of political debate. The government repeatedly announced – even if it used ambiguous formulations – that it would withdraw Italian troops by 2006. The centre‐left, on the contrary, argued for an immediate withdrawal. Public opinion, which had always been inclined against the war, reinforced its opposition after the dramatic events of the liberation of an Italian journalist kidnapped in Iraq. Immediately after her liberation, on the road toward the airport, the car was inexplicably fired upon by an American patrol, leading to the death of the well‐regarded state security agent Nicola Calipari, who was escorting the journalist and who protected and saved her from the bullets with his own body. This tragic occurrence provoked high emotion among the public and even the strongly pro‐American Italian government initially took a fierce position by requesting an active and joint investigation. This position, however, did not produce any result since the United States failed to recognise its responsibility and limited its response to a diplomatic, standard, statement of regret.</p>

         <p>By the end of the year, a new electoral law was approved by the government amid a very hot confrontation with the opposition. The new regulation re‐introduced a party‐list proportional representation system with a bonus for the winning coalition in each chamber – although with some differences between the Chamber of Deputies (<i>Camera</i>) and the Senate (<i>Senato</i>). In the Chamber, the bonus, granting 54 per cent of the seats, is allotted to the coalition that gets the relative majority, provided that it reaches a minimum of 10 per cent of the votes and that one of the parties of the coalition reaches a minimum of 2 per cent of the votes. Parties in a coalition gain representation only if they get more than 2 per cent (plus the largest one below 2 per cent). Parties that do not join any coalition and stand on their own must get at least 4 per cent to obtain representation. The same rules apply to the Senate with two differences: first, the quotas to get representation are 20 per cent for a coalition, 3 per cent minimum for parties in a coalition and 8 per cent for parties outside a coalition; second, and much more importantly, the bonus (assuring 55 per cent of the seats) is not calculated on the total votes cast nationally, but <i>region by region</i>, and therefore is calculated on the basis of the number of seats assigned to each region. This implies that winning in large regions such as Lombardy, Campania, Latium or Sicily offers an important asset for final victory in the Senate. The party lists are closed; thus no expression of an intraparty preference is possible.
         </p>
         
         <p>The most apparent and relevant accomplishment of the government was the profound reform of the Constitution. The government modified some fifty articles (almost a third) without the consent or the contribution of the opposition, thus even further poisoning the relationship between the two camps. These changes are still <i>sub judice</i> since the centre‐left called for a referendum, which is the last chance to derail the enforcement of the new Constitution – whose implementation, however, has been postponed to 2011, and even to 2016 for some articles. The referendum will take place in first half of 2006.
