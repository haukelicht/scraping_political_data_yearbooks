         <p>The Zachopoulos scandal (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2008</a></span>: 997) continued to unfold in January 2008, provoking the temporary exit of one MP from ND, whose majority was thereby reduced to 151 – the bare minimum in a parliament of 300 members. Nevertheless, the pitiful affair was soon to be forgotten. It was supplanted by the Greek end of a major international scandal involving bribes by the German firm Siemens to Greek government officials and, apparently, to both major Greek parties, mostly before 2004 (i.e., under PASOK). The belated inquiry by the Greek judiciary was to drag on into the next year.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 28 January, Archbishop Christodoulos died of cancer. Gifted and ambitious, for almost ten years he had sought for himself an enlarged political or ‘national’ role, provoking conflict on many fronts and squandering his initial popularity (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2001</a></span>: 318–319, <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2003a</a></span>: 122–124, 130–132, <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2003b</a></span>: 966, <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2006</a></span>: 1118). On 7 February, he was succeeded by Hieronymos II, a low‐key prelate who had been prevented from seeking the highest ecclesiastical office back in 1998 by fabricated charges of financial mismanagement. This time he won by a handsome margin (45 bishops voted for him, against 27 for his rival). More than ever before, the election appeared free of outside influence (cf. <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2003a</a></span>: 126).
         </p>
         
         <p>Two party congresses were held soon thereafter. Earlier, Alekos Alavanos had ostensibly resigned the party leadership of SYN and handpicked the 33 year‐old Alexis Tsipras as his successor. On 10 February, the 5th Congress of SYN duly ratified this choice by a 70 per cent majority. The choice of Tsipras was an obvious marketing ploy to promote SYN as the party of youth. Indeed, polls indicated a precipitous rise in support for SYRIZA (the electoral alliance around SYN), reaching as high as 18 per cent. For his part, Alavanos, unreliable as ever, had no intention whatsoever of retiring. He remained as the strident parliamentary spokesman and chairman of SYRIZA (while Tsipras was not even an MP). The end result was that the party not only had two faces, as SYN and as SYRIZA, but also henceforth spoke with two voices, the louder of which continued to be that of Alavanos.</p>
         
         <p>In March, the 8th PASOK Congress convened, with as many as 7,000 participants. It failed utterly to provide a ‘new beginning’, as promised. Despite a deceptive show of unity, G. Papandreou's leadership was repeatedly challenged. Out of 150 elected members of the new National Council, he barely managed to fill 90 positions with his own supporters, whereas his rival E. Venizelos won 56. Moreover, Papandreou's choice for the post of Secretary (Yannis Rangousis) was elected by a bare majority of the National Council (159 out of 273 voting). In contrast, his previous choices had mustered at least 80 per cent (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2006</a></span>: 1117, <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2007</a></span>: 964). Papandreou's proposal to the National Council for the election of the 14‐member Political Council included four Venizelos supporters. Moreover, his favourite, F. Gennimata, received a mere 71 votes and was elected only because of the mandatory quota for women. Although popular and much applauded by the Congress, Papandreou's decision to exclude all former ministers and vice‐ministers from the new Political Council meant that this would henceforth be a lightweight body of little consequence – quite unlike the old Executive Bureau that it replaced.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Karamanlis Government finally managed to pass its controversial pension reform bill (see <span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2008</a></span>: 997) in late March. Although far less radical than the reform that was actually required, it upset or threatened the vested interests of various privileged groups, who reacted fiercely. For almost a month, the country suffered from strikes affecting garbage collection and electricity supplies, while the journalists were also ordered occasionally by their archaic guild to impose a complete news blackout. For their part, striking employees of the Bank of Greece managed to shut down the Athens stock exchange for several days. So much for globalisation . . . Other long‐delayed reforms that were pushed through during 2008 despite savage and violent resistance included the (partial) privatisation of OTE (telecommunications), whose management passed to Deutsche Telekom, and of container facilities in the port of Piraeus, whose management passed to Cosco, a Chinese company.
         </p>
         
         <p>In early April, during the NATO summit in Bucharest, Prime Minister Karamanlis won a Pyrrhic victory by preventing the projected invitation to FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) to join the organisation, as the United States insisted. As Greece desired, it was agreed that the controversy over the state's official name had to be resolved first. The ongoing bilateral negotiations under United Nations auspices made no progress during 2008, partly because of increased intransigence on the part of FYROM after the rebuff at Bucharest.</p>
         
         <p>The Greek parliament approved the European Union's Lisbon Treaty on 11 June 2008 by an overwhelming majority (250 out of 292 present) comprising both major parties (ND and PASOK). Both ends of the party spectrum (KKE and SYRIZA on the left, LAOS on the right) voted against. Although it voted in favour, PASOK was concerned not to appear less ‘radical’ than SYRIZA and KKE, and so joined them in asking for a referendum on the Treaty. Angered by such blatant inconsistency, PASOK's previous leader and former Prime Minister K. Simitis disagreed publicly and Papandreou promptly expelled him from the parliamentary group (though not from the party).</p>
         
         <p>A new and bizarre scandal broke out in late August, involving hundreds of swaps of public land with a disputed lake to the advantage of the venerable Vatopedion monastery on Mount Athos – surreptitiously transformed by its latest abbot into a booming financial business, including several offshore companies. Minister of Marine and Island Policy G. Voulgarakis was eventually forced to resign in disgrace because of the central (and eminently lucrative) role played in this affair by his wife (a notary public) and by his father‐in‐law (a lawyer), but also because of his own questionable financial arrangements. He was replaced on 13 September by A. Papaligouras, Minister of Justice in the previous government.</p>
         
         <p>Voulgarakis was not the only victim of the Vatopedion affair. On 23 October, the powerful Minister of State Th. Roussopoulos – considered to be the Prime Minister's most influential crony – was also forced to resign on account of his cozy ‘spiritual’ ties to the enterprising abbot. He was replaced only as government spokesman, not as minister (being, in effect, ‘without portfolio’). Despite the sacrifice of two key ministers, and although the ensuing parliamentary inquiry eventually found no evidence of criminal conduct, the Vatopedion scandal dealt a blow to the Karamanlis Government from which it was not to recover. For the first time since the 2007 election, PASOK overtook ND in the polls and was to increase its lead in the following months. In another development, the troublesome disgruntled former vice‐minister P. Tatoulis was finally expelled from ND on 10 November, thereby definitively reducing the government's parliamentary majority to just 151 seats.</p>
         
         <p>On 6 December, the wanton killing of a teenager by a trigger‐happy policeman in Exarcheia, the ‘anarchist’ neighbourhood of Athens, set off an unexpected social explosion and the worst riots in Greece since the end of the military dictatorship in 1974. These events stemmed from the confluence of diverse factors, on several levels, which one needs to disentangle. This was a spontaneous but inchoate youthful rebellion, lit by anger over the killing and fuelled by economic insecurity. Yet it was encouraged and exploited by opposition forces and above all by SYRIZA in the most extravagant and irresponsible manner. Of key practical significance was the sanctuary offered to rioters by the so‐called ‘university asylum’ (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2008</a></span>: 993) and by Exarcheia as an area long considered off‐limits to the police.
         </p>
         
         <p>These circumstances provided an evidently long‐awaited opportunity for action by a well‐organised network of anarchist groups, well‐stocked with crowbars and Molotov cocktails. They did most of the damage, torching, breaking and looting buildings and cars. In what was their most spectacular and protracted campaign to date, these groups also exhibited, for the first time, unmistakable signs of strict discipline, hierarchical control and nationwide coordination. It was amazing but telling that in all this terrifying orgy of violence and destruction no civilian was actually attacked or seriously hurt. The police were the only enemy.</p>
         
         <p>Petrified by the prospect of more deaths, the Karamanlis Government opted for what was dubbed euphemistically a ‘defensive’ posture: letting the rioters exhaust themselves. Consequently, once again, the police appeared both unable and unwilling to restore order and, especially, to protect hundreds of mostly small stores, private cars and so on. The riots were to continue into the next year and produce an unprecedented widespread feeling of insecurity.</p>
         
         <p>It is remarkable – even amazing, in a comparative perspective – that no extreme right‐wing forces took advantage of the situation. Even LAOS, the closest to a far‐right party that Greece actually possesses, remained circumspect and restrained. The explanation has to do with the experience of the military dictatorship (1967–1974), which continues to haunt Greek public life, thanks to the official memory promoted in the most methodical and intimidating manner by the left. It may be said, in a nutshell, that the experience of the dictatorship has inoculated Greek public opinion against the appeal of authoritarian solutions. On the other hand, in the eyes of many, the selfsame experience continues to legitimise as ‘democratic’ violent actions – as if the regime was still a repressive one. Both as a government and as a centre‐right party, ND has utterly failed to redress the balance in favour of the law and order required by a democracy.</p>

         <p>Originally announced in December 2005 (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2006</a></span>: 1119), ND's perfunctory project of constitutional revision concluded on 27 May 2008. Its major consequence is that no new revision can be formally initiated before June 2013. Otherwise, out of 38 initially proposed constitutional amendments, only three were eventually approved by the parliament: special treatment for island and mountain areas; the repeal of the prohibition voted in the previous revision in 2001 (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2002</a></span>: 967) against the private practice by MPs of their respective professions; and the possibility to amend particular items of the budget. Only these three changes received more than the required 180 votes thanks to an unlikely consensus among all parties (ND, SYRIZA, KKE, LAOS) except PASOK, which simply walked out, once again (cf. <span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2008</a></span>: 990).
