         <p>As with last year, this article considers the events during the year in their order of importance as assessed by me. However, first let it be noted that there were certain characteristics identical between 1 January 2005 and 1 January 2006. The Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party was identical, John Howard. So, too, were the leaders of the Democrats (Senator Lyn Allison) and the Greens (Senator Bob Brown). The differences in party leadership related to the Labor Party and the National Party. I explained much of the detail of the Labor case last year. Suffice it here to note that on 1 January 2005 the Labor leader was <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mark Latham</a></span>, while on 1 January 2006 the leader was Kim Beazley. <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Latham</a></span> ceded the leadership to Beazley on 28 January 2005. There is every reason to believe that Beazley will lead Labor into the next election, due towards the end of 2007.
         </p>
         
         <p>Before I consign <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Latham</a></span> to the rubbish bin of history there is one thing to note about his activities in 2005. In September he published diaries he had been keeping for the years he had been in parliament. These diaries amounted to dirt thrown at everyone, particularly his Labor colleagues. They sold quite well – though not as well as expected. They had a very brief negative effect on Labor's standing in the opinion polls. Book reviews were very harsh on Latham and few observers would dispute my assertion that <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mark Latham</a></span> was by far the worst leader Labor ever had.
         </p>
         
         <p>The change in the leadership of the National Party offered a great contrast to that of Labor. On 23 June, the Leader of the Nationals, John Anderson, announced that he would retire from his seat of Gwydir (NSW) at the expiration of the life of the parliament. His resignation as party leader, Deputy Prime Minister and cabinet minister would be effective forthwith. Consequently, the Nationals elected a new leader, Mark Vaile, and there was a cabinet reshuffle – effective on 6 July. Changes among Liberal ministers were trivial, just a little change in titles and rankings here and there. However, the three National Party members of the cabinet changed and these changes can be seen in <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a>. The new member of the cabinet is Peter McGauran, the National Party member for Gippsland in Victoria who is now the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The reshuffle did not affect the gender balance, party balance or distribution of cabinet places between the Senate and the House of Representatives.

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss2"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss2-title"> Howard and the Senate</h3>
            
            <p>The most significant feature of the October 2004 election result was that the Howard Government would have a majority in the Senate from July 2005. The Coalition parties gained four seats, rising from 35 to 39 out of 76 seats. Hence, the upper house is worth more than its usual consideration here. Although the term ‘control freak’ is not widely used in Australia that is what Howard is. For this reason, he expressed great frustration during his first three terms (1996–1998, 1998–2001 and 2001–2004). His lack of a Senate majority meant that not everything would be done his way. Furthermore, the non‐Coalition majority in the Senate could set up embarrassing enquiries into aspects of Howard policy and behavior – quite apart from rejecting legislation it did not like.</p>
            
            <p>Last year I expressed the view that: ‘Party discipline is so strong in Australia that a Senate majority for a government is almost as good as abolishing the upper house’, and continued with this prediction:</p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Clearly the new Senate will pass all the bills rejected in the last term. However, it will do more than that – a significant amount of the kind of legislative change recently implemented by President Bush in the United States will find its way through the Australian federal parliament as well. (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2005</a></span>: 936–937)</p>

               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>This prediction turned out to be true with a vengeance. During the parliamentary sittings from August through to December both houses passed legislation dear to the hearts of members of the government. The use of the majority was so brutal, and its manner so contemptuous of the Senate, as to lead to the complaint by Howard at year's end quoted below. Clearly stung by criticism, Howard was flagging an intention not to be so aggressive during 2006 and, more importantly, during the election year of 2007. In an interview with Laura Tingle published in the last issue for the year of the <i>Weekend Australian Financial Review</i>, Howard is quoted as saying:
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>We don't want to miss the opportunity we have of doing things we believe in, and that we think are very good. I find it puzzling that words like ‘aggression’ are used in relation to our control of both houses, when the Queensland Labor government has control of the only house and the Victorian Labor government has control of both houses and they are not accused of aggression.</p>
<p>I mean, what's the difference? I find this preoccupation with the fact we use our Senate majority to legislate the things we believe in quite extraordinary. I mean why would we not legislate? It's not aggressive, it's just normal.</p>
<p>Admittedly the past six months of legislative activity were unusual and not likely to be repeated. There was a certain build‐up because so many things were blocked by those that would frustrate the will of the people. In other words, there were a lot of things we wanted to do that we couldn't because we didn't have the numbers in the Senate.</p>
<p>That having changed, it was inevitable that there would be quite a bank‐up of changes we wanted to get through. . . . Telstra, industrial relations, voluntary student unionism, tax cuts. Those are the four things that would distinguish the year.</p>
<p>Looking to 2006 there are not three or four things to take their place, and we are not going to put things up purely for the sake of using our Senate majority.

            <p>The plaintive tone of the above is sick‐making to anyone following Australian politics in detail. By ‘Telstra’ Howard means the full privatization of Australia's telecommunications giant. By ‘industrial relations’ he means the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (more information is given on this subject below).</p>
            
            <p>As to why Howard was so often accused of aggression, the explanation is that his behavior was unusually aggressive. Furthermore, the essential answer was given in my commentary last year. I pointed out that only prime ministers from the Liberal Party (Sir Robert Menzies, 1949–1966; Malcolm Fraser, 1975–1983; and John Howard, since 1996) have ever enjoyed Senate majorities over the past sixty years. I went on as follows:</p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>There is a difference, however. Menzies and Fraser would explicitly ask for a Senate vote. By contrast Howard knew that such a request would meet rejection. Too many people valued the checks and balances given by the Senate. His strategy, therefore, was to get a Senate majority by stealth. Persuade all the commentators that a Senate majority is well‐nigh impossible. The consequence would be that people would give very little thought to their Senate vote. Then rely on the semi‐proportional nature of the system to get a majority of Senate seats without a majority of Senate votes.</p>

         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005</h3>
            
            <p>It could be argued in Howard's defense that the full privatization of Telstra had long been the stated objective of his government. He announced this policy as long ago as 1995 and achieved partial sales of shares during his earlier terms. The Senate allowed him to do this because he explicitly stated in advance of elections that such was his determination. At all times opinion poll findings were negative to his wish, but at least he had been honest in stating his intentions. In that sense he had a mandate to do something opposed by the great majority of voters.</p>
            
            <p>Australia's system of industrial relations has for virtually a century been one of conciliation and arbitration with the state playing an important role. The economists would call it a regulated labor market in which the trade unions have been a key part. Howard has never liked that system. He has always regarded unions as being interfering third parties between employers and employees. Very early in Howard's first term the Senate agreed to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 which provided for a very partial de‐regulation. It was, if you like, the thin end of the wedge to replacing state‐mandated industrial awards by what are now known as ‘Australian Workplace Agreements’.</p>
            
            <p>No sooner had Howard won his Senate majority than he announced an industrial relations revolution. No notice of this had been given during the 2004 general election campaign. When the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) mounted an advertising campaign (paid for from its own resources), Howard responded with a AUS$55 million taxpayer‐funded campaign of his own. The ACTU argued that this campaign should have been funded by the Liberal Party since there was not even legislation on the table to implement the changes. Unfortunately for the ACTU, the High Court held that this spending of public money was permitted by the Australian Constitution. Both sides considered the other's advertisements (in newspapers, on radio and on television) to be dishonest.</p>
            
            <p>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 is universally regarded as the most important piece of legislation passed during the year. Its opponents see it as a revolution designed simply to enhance the power of employers and weaken the trade unions and, therefore, individual employees. The government describes the Act as bringing about ‘measured changes’ to strengthen the economy. The Act, which stretches to nearly 700 pages, was passed by the Senate (and received royal assent) in December.</p>
            
            <p>As a consequence of the Telstra privatization combined with the so‐called ‘work choices’ legislation, opinion polls at year's end had the Howard Government losing in a landslide any general election held at that time. The polls did not worry the government. With two years to go before the actual vote late in 2007, Howard expressed confidence that the public would realize that the sky had not fallen and that the economy had been strengthened.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> Howard's second longest term</h3>
            
            <p>In December 2004, Howard became the second longest‐serving Australian prime minister. It is, therefore, worth setting out the details of the terms of office of the four men longest‐serving in that office. Robert Menzies was prime minister from April 1939 to August 1941 – a total of two years, four months and four days. Then he served another term from December 1949 to January 1966 – a total of sixteen years, one month and eight days. Howard's term is likely to be somewhere between ten and fifteen years. Robert Hawke (Labor) was prime minister from March 1983 to December 1991 – a total of eight years, nine months and eight days. Malcolm Fraser's term accounted for seven years and four months exactly.</p>
            
            <p>During 2005 there was continual media speculation that the deputy leader of the Liberal Party, Peter Costello (also the Treasurer in the Howard Government), would challenge Howard for the top job. However, no challenge eventuated. Media analysts agree that the position of Howard <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> Costello was stronger at the end of the year than it had been at the beginning. Analysts are now divided fifty‐fifty between those who expect Howard to lead his party in the 2007 election campaign and those who expect his earlier retirement in Costello's favor.

            <p>Since March 2002, all six State Premiers and both Territory Chief Ministers have been from the Labor Party, the party that constitutes the federal Opposition. However, the person holding the office of Premier of New South Wales changed in August 2005 when Bob Carr (Labor), who had been Premier from April 1995 to August 2005, resigned his office to, as he expressed it, ‘enjoy the Sydney sunshine’. He later gained a lucrative job with a private bank. Two other ministers in the Carr Government also retired. The three seats were all easily retained by Labor at subsequent by‐elections in September.</p>
            
            <p>The only notable event so far in the premiership of Morris Iemma was that on Sunday 11 December there were race riots at Cronulla beach in Sydney's southern suburbs. The trouble arose from tensions between traditional Australians of Anglo‐Celtic background and men described as being ‘of Middle Eastern appearance’. The essential problem was the heavily Anglo‐Celtic nature of the Cronulla area and the fact that the outsiders came from distant suburbs. Commentators agreed that Iemma handled the problem well. Although these race riots gave Australia some bad publicity internationally, it did no lasting harm.</p>
            
            <p>On Saturday 26 February there was a state general election in Western Australia at which the Gallop Labor Government was returned with a slightly reduced majority. The result was that Labor won 32 seats in the Legislative Assembly, the Liberal Party won 18 and the National Party five. In addition, two Independents were elected. That means Labor won seven seats more than the combination of all the others. On Saturday 18 June there was a general election in the Northern Territory, producing a landslide re‐election for the Martin Labor Government. Labor won 19 seats in the Legislative Assembly and the Opposition Country Liberal Party only four. Two Independents were elected. That means Labor won 13 seats more than the combination of its opponents.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss6"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss6-title"> Two well‐publicized Australian deaths</h3>
            
            <p>In December there occurred two deaths of Australian citizens receiving an unusual degree of publicity – though the circumstances could scarcely be more different. The only similarity (apart from their both being male) is that each death produced an outpouring of praise for the dead out of all proportion to their virtue. Early in the morning of Friday 2 December the Government of Singapore executed (by hanging) a young criminal, Nguyen Tuong Van, aged 25 at the time of his death. In 2003 he had been arrested at Changi Airport with 396 grams of heroin strapped to his body. His botched smuggling run was meant to generate cash to pay the debts of his drug‐addicted twin brother. After being hanged, his body was flown back to Australia for a burial service amid comments that he had rehabilitated and did not deserve to die so young. Most Australian politicians made the pretence of being opposed to the death penalty, but opinion polls suggested there was little sympathy for him among the general public. Many pleas were made by influential Australians, but the Singapore cabinet repeatedly refused clemency. Late in the evening of Boxing Day (Monday 26 December), Australia's richest person, Kerry Packer, died at the age of 68, leaving behind a fortune estimated to be worth AUS$7 billion. He had inherited a media empire in 1974 upon the death of his father, Sir Frank Packer, but added to a business that now includes a television network, magazines, casinos, ski resorts, rural properties and coal mines. At the time of his death he was estimated to be the 94th richest person in the world.</p>
