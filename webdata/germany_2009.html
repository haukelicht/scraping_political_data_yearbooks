         <p>The year following the national election was marked by an unprecedented slump in the poll ratings of the junior coalition partner the <i>Freie Demokratische Partei</i> (Free Democratic Party, FDP). Arguably, the FDP was paying the price for entering the government without a sound programmatic base. What had been visible already during the coalition negotiations in autumn 2009 (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Poguntke 2010</a></span>) became obvious in the following year: The Christian‐Liberal coalition lacked a common vision and was plagued from the start by a debate over tax reductions which was the core (if not only) concern of the FDP, while the Christian parties pointed to the financial burden as a result of the banking crisis and favoured a course of budget consolidation. It clearly did not help the prestige of the FDP that the only tax cut the government implemented shortly after it took office favoured the hotel industry while one of its leading protagonists had given large financial donations to the FDP. When the euro crisis reached it first peak in May, Chancellor Merkel one‐sidedly declared on the night of the North Rhine‐Westphalian <i>Land</i> elections that tax cuts were finally off the agenda. This left the FDP without any major policy project and their downward trend continued, reaching the low mark of the 5 per cent hurdle in the polls by mid‐2010.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another important factor which contributed to the tide turning against the FDP was the debate following a decision by the February Constitutional Court ruling that the method of deciding the amount of social security payments (the so‐called ‘Hart IV payments’) was unconstitutional. While the public debate was widely expecting rising payments, liberal leader and Vice‐Chancellor Guido Westerwelle infamously compared such expectations to ‘late Roman decadence’. This sparked off a heated debate about social justice and left the FDP leader out in the political wilderness.</p>
         
         <p>The <i>Land</i> election of North Rhine‐Westphalia was an important landmark in the evolution of German politics for two reasons. First, the government camp lost control over the largest <i>Land</i> and, as a result, could no longer count on a Christian‐Liberal majority in the <i>Bundesrat</i>. Second, the post‐Communist party <i>Die Linke</i> (The Left) effectively became part of the governing formula. After long negotiations, a red–green minority coalition was formed which depended on the toleration of <i>Die Linke</i>, which had won seats in the <i>Land</i> parliament for the first time. This marked a substantial departure from the line of the Social Democrats who had so far not been relying on support from <i>Die Linke</i> in the Western part of Germany; an attempt in Hesse had failed spectacularly in 2008–2009 (see <span title=""><a href="#b1001%20#b2" id="#b1001 #b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Poguntke 2009, 2010</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Shortly after the North Rhine‐Westphalian <i>Land</i> election, the coalition suffered another blow when federal president Horst Köhler, who had been supported by the Christian‐Liberal camp, suddenly resigned over a minor row about a somewhat unfortunate statement concerning the need also to consider economic interests when deciding about German military engagement abroad. The Social Democrats and Greens swiftly put forward the popular previous head of the Stasi Archives Joachim Gauck. The former protestant priest had been a leading figure in the opposition against the Communist regime in East Germany and was presented as a cross‐party candidate for the election by the <i>Bundesversammlung</i> on 29 June. The coalition parties countered with Lower Saxony Prime Minister Christian Wulff who needed three ballots to get elected because Joachim Gauck apparently attracted dissenting votes from the bourgeois camp. In the end, the government could consider itself lucky that <i>Die Linke</i> fielded their own candidate instead of supporting the red–green candidate. Clearly, this was an important signal that a majority of the left will not come about easily.
         </p>
         
         <p>Several major players within the <i>Christlich Demokratische Union</i> (Christian Democratic Union, CDU) left the national stage in 2010 which left Chancellor Merkel in an unrivalled position as a CDU leader. Baden‐Württemberg Prime Minister Günther Oettinger was nominated by the Chancellor for a top job in Brussels and joined the Commission in February; Christian Wulff was promoted to the largely representative office of federal presidency and hence removed from a serious position of power. The arguably strongest contender, Roland Koch, announced in May that he would leave politics for a second career and business and, finally, the Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust resigned in July after his CDU–Green coalition had suffered a major setback in a controversy over school reform which was successfully challenged by a popular referendum initiative.
         </p>
         
         <p>The summer was dominated by a heated debate about a book by Thilo Sarrazin, former SPD Berlin Finance Senator and then Board Member of the <i>Bundesbank</i> which was widely perceived as having anti‐immigration overtones. The book quickly reached seven‐digit sales figures while Sarrazin was forced to resign from his <i>Bundesbank</i> post and faced an (unsuccessful) attempt to strip him of his SPD membership.
         </p>
         
         <p>After a fairly unsuccessful first year at the helm of a Christian‐Liberal government, Chancellor Merkel decided in the autumn to seek a more confrontational stance <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the opposition parties. First, she declared a highly controversial multi‐billion euro railway station construction project in the Baden‐Württemberg city of Stuttgart to be a touchstone of the ability of politics to push for economic modernisation. Second, she pushed for a substantially extended period of time before nuclear energy production would be ended in Germany. This represented a fundamental departure from the so‐called ‘nuclear consensus’ which had been reached under the red–green Schröder government in 2000. Both decisions were widely perceived as excluding future Christian–green cooperation – not least in the crucial region of Baden‐Württemberg where a <i>Land</i> election was to be held in spring 2011. The shift in nuclear policies led to a quick mobilisation of the anti‐nuclear movement in Germany. Also, the start of the Stuttgart construction project resulted in the massive mobilisation of street protests. In the end, it could only be contained by the Christian–Liberal <i>Land</i> government agreeing to appoint a moderator who held a public hearing on the pros and cons of the project.
         </p>
         
         <p>Major policy changes included the suspension of the draft which was effectively sealed by a decision of the Christian leadership bodies in September, and the decision by the <i>Bundestag</i> in November to freeze the health insurance contributions by employers. Effectively, this meant a departure from the established model of health finance which had been based on equal contributions by employers and employees. As a result of a Constitutional Court decision, the system of social security payments needed to be reformed. As this required the consent of the <i>Bundesrat</i>, the government needed to negotiate with the SPD and Greens, but no compromise was reached before the deadline of 31 December.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, it was not a good year for the Christian churches in Germany. The Catholic Church was hit by a major scandal over child abuse and the Chair of the Council of the German Protestant Church Bishop Margot Käßmann resigned after drunk driving.</p>
