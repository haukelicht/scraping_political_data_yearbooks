         <p>In early February, the Government chose to unveil (after almost one year of silence) a major scandal of illegal surveillance through Vodafone mobile telephones. Although the Prime Minister himself was among the targets, the Government failed to benefit from its intended image as a victim of the conspiracy. Instead, it projected an image of incompetence and lack of control. All the more so since the mystery (including the suicide of a Vodafone executive) was never resolved, leaving the lingering impression that the American Embassy was involved.</p>
         
         <p>To dispel the negative impressions created by this affair, Prime Minister K. Karamanlis swiftly proceeded with the first reshuffle of his cabinet on 14 February: five ministers left the Government, five new ministers entered it and four (including Deputy Minister of Culture F. Palli‐Petralia) were moved. The most important change was undoubtedly the entry of Dora Bakoyanni, hitherto Mayor of Athens, triumphantly elected in 2002 (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2003</a></span>: 966). Daughter of K. Mitsotakis, former ND leader and Prime Minister (until 1993), she was an obvious choice for Foreign Affairs, and remains the best‐placed future contender for the ND party leadership. Another significant entry was that of the outspoken V. Polydoras, originally excluded from the Karamanlis Government for his careless ‘revanchist’ remarks against PASOK appointees during the 2004 electoral campaign. The resilient S. Tsitouridis returned to the Government after his ignominious resignation in September 2004 over an issue of personal ethics (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2005</a></span>: 1032). Finally, E. Meimarakis left the party apparatus to serve in the Government. He was replaced as ND party secretary by the well‐liked E. Zagoritis. Among those leaving the Government, the venerable P. Molyviatis retired from politics, while N. Kaklamanis was immediately nominated as the ND candidate for the mayorship of Athens in the coming October election.
         </p>
         
         <p>The most protracted and catastrophic confrontation that the Karamanlis Government had experienced so far began in the spring. At issue were its plans for university reform, and for the revision of Article 16 of the Constitution, to allow private (but nonprofit) universities. Vociferous opposition to this prospect of ‘privatisation’ became the battle cry of a coalition of professors, teachers, and student groups sponsored by the Left, both parliamentary (KKE and SYN) and extra‐parliamentary. For its part, PASOK tried to exploit the situation at the expense of the Government, even though its party leader, G. Papandreou, had long expressed identical views against the state's monopoly of higher education.</p>
         
         <p>Although the revision of Article 16 was demonised by opponents, the latter were in fact determined to prevent <i>any</i> change in the <i>public</i> universities, despite their sorry state and continuing decline. Any change would upset and threaten the vested interests of those among the faculty and the students making the least effort, as well as the linked vested interests of party organisations playing a decisive role in the administration and operation of the public universities since the PASOK reforms of 1982. Fueled by the Government's inept tactics and poor timing, the confrontation escalated into a wave of coordinated ‘occupations’ of university buildings by violent student minorities, which paralysed most public universities in May and June. Missed classes and examinations were supposedly replaced in September.
         </p>
         
         <p>Unlike previous occasions, the local elections held in October produced no excitement and no significant change (despite the new wave of corruption charges that preceded them in September). The elections were held under the new law passed by ND requiring only a 42 per cent plurality for the election of mayors and prefects. Previously, an absolute majority had been required; otherwise, a runoff election was held a week later. Under the new law, a runoff was not necessary in most cases, thereby preventing the coalescence of opposition forces that ND apparently feared. For its part, it was even prepared to ally itself with the KKE to prevent PASOK victories in Thessaly (albeit with negative results). Eventually, some municipalities and some prefectures changed hands, but losses and gains between ND and PASOK largely balanced each other. Among the largest cities, the loss of Piraeus by ND was offset by the gain of Patras, hitherto a PASOK stronghold. Under the circumstances, PASOK could not claim victory. The Government, however, could claim that it retained its majority, which was also monotonously confirmed by opinion polls.</p>
         
         <p>Following the disappointing PASOK performance in the local elections, its beleaguered leader, Papandreou, proceeded with his own surprise reshuffle in early December, when he called the party's National Council to elect a new Political Council and a new Secretary (N. Athanasakis). As in 2005 (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2006</a></span>: 965), Papandreou's choices were contested by almost a fifth of the National Council, and once again three people were elected to the Political Council in place of his own nominees. Apart from the reaffirmation of internal opposition, the most novel development (and one at odds with the party's history) was the institution of a new Parliamentary Council of twelve members, which seemed bound to overshadow the Political Council if, as Papandreou announced, Parliament was to be the ‘battlefield’ henceforth.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, in October a month‐long strike by the teachers paralysed elementary education and served as the catalyst for a renewal of the confrontation with the Government over university reform, which was to continue into the next year and escalate further.</p>

         <p>Changing Article 16 to allow private universities seemed the only concrete reason for initiating another constitutional revision at the end of 2005, so soon after the previous one (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2006</a></span>: 967). As it turned out, this was practically the only item of the larger ND project that aroused public interest and passion. Another was the proposed change of the article protecting forests. The overall ND project of constitutional revision, as originally outlined by Prime Minister Karamanlis in January 2006, sounded quite ambitious. However, the actual proposals he eventually presented in May constituted a disappointing anticlimax. This allowed Papandreou to seize the initiative and present more imaginative proposals, including the popular election of the President of the Republic (now elected by Parliament). No details are necessary here since this eventually came to naught.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, a poll published by the newspaper <i>Kathimerini</i> (31 December 2006) revealed the distance between citizen expectations and the meager actual performance of the parties, especially ND. A majority (49 per cent) of those polled thought that the Government lacked a complete plan of reforms. Only 62 per cent of ND supporters thought otherwise. There were also large majorities for changes that were simply missing from the ongoing constitutional revision: for the popular election of the President (80 per cent), for reducing the size of Parliament by one‐third (71 per cent), for referenda by popular initiative (70 per cent). In contrast, changing Article 16 to allow private universities divided citizens almost evenly (50 per cent in favour, 45 per cent against). Ironically, this proved to be the only major reform on the Government's agenda.
