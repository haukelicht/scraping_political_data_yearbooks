         <p>Despite the emphatic election victory in the previous year, Labour had a difficult 2002 fuelled mainly by dissatisfaction with, and the Government's plans for, public services (see below). This led to two cabinet re‐shuffles within five months. In May, the beleaguered Transport Secretary, Stephen Byers, resigned. The ensuing re‐shuffle saw Paul Boateng become Britain's first black cabinet member (as Chief Secretary to the Treasury). In October, there was a further re‐shuffle caused by the resignation of Education Secretary, Estelle Morris.</p>
         
         <p>There was also trouble within Government ranks in the House of Commons. The 2001–2002 parliamentary session saw more rebellions (76) by Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) than during the first session of any previous Labour Government. Even examining 2002 alone, there were 36 rebellions from January to November (the end of the first session), and a further four in the first month of the new session. Labour also suffered the loss of its longest serving MEP (Member of the European Parliament), Richard Balfe, who joined the Conservatives. He was the first elected Labour politician to join the Conservatives since 1977. There was better news in February when Labour continued its record of winning every by‐election it was defending while in government. Despite a swing of 8 per cent to Plaid Cymru, Huw Irranca‐Davies held the seat of Ogmore in Wales, which had become vacant following the death of the sitting MP.<a href="#t1%20#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The generally difficult year was reflected in Labour's poll ratings. Despite remaining the most popular party by some margin, Labour's mean poll rating fell from 48 per cent in January to 39 per cent in December. However, the main beneficiaries of this decline were the Liberal Democrats, rather than Labour's principal opposition, the Conservatives. Not surprisingly, the fall in Labour's poll ratings was mirrored by a significant decline in satisfaction with the Government's record and general economic optimism. Satisfaction ratings for Tony Blair also fell. He began the year with a net rating of +12 and ended it with −16.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the difficulties for the incumbent party, the Conservatives were unable to capitalise. Instead, the party's year was dominated by questions over the suitability of its newly elected leader, Iain Duncan‐Smith. In July, after reportedly suspecting that party chairman David Davies was plotting against him, Duncan‐Smith, re‐shuffled his shadow cabinet, replacing Davies with Theresa May, as well as making other changes. At the party's conference in September, Duncan‐Smith re‐affirmed his commitment to leading the party, warning delegates that they should not ‘underestimate the determination of the quiet man’. Nevertheless, by November, the leader was forced to state publicly that he would not quit. Duncan‐Smith had imposed a three‐line whip on Conservative MPs on an issue that was traditionally one where there would be a free‐vote (over the rights of unmarried and gay couples to adopt children). This prompted a revolt where several senior Conservative MPs, including former leadership challengers Kenneth Clarke and Michael Portillo, defied the party whip. Following the rebellion, a prominent ‘moderniser’ in the shadow cabinet, John Bercow, resigned. Another former leadership candidate, Michael Heseltine, also damaged the leadership when in December he declared that the Conservatives could not win the next election with Duncan‐Smith as leader. This prompted Norman Tebbitt, a senior Thatcherite, to brand Heseltine a ‘serial Conservative assassin’ (Heseltine was instrumental in the fall of Margaret Thatcher in 1990). For all that, Duncan‐Smith did win public approval after his swift sacking of a shadow minister for allegedly having told a racist joke at a public event. Nevertheless, Conservative failings were clearly reflected in opinion polls. The party's mean rating remained virtually static, beginning the year on 29 per cent and ending it on 30 per cent with barely any variation in between. And, whilst the party's ratings remained unchanged, those of the leader fell significantly from a net rating of −8 in January to −30 in December.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberal Democrats attempted to capitalise on Labour's difficulties over public services by seeking a dialogue with the trade unions. In March, the leader, Charles Kennedy, revealed that he was willing to cooperate with unions to promote services, claiming that dialogue with his party was more open than with the trade unions’ traditional political allies. There was bad news for the party in April, where in the run‐up to the local elections, sixty candidates’ nominations for the London Borough of Harrow were declared invalid, because by calling themselves ‘Liberal Democrat Focus Team’, they contravened the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act. The irony here was that the Liberal Democrats had called for the registration of official party names following the 1994 European elections where they apparently lost 10,000 votes to an unknown candidate standing in the name of the ‘<i>Literal</i> Democrats’. Overall, however, the party's fortunes improved over the course of the year. Its mean poll rating rose by 5 percentage points over the year, ending on 23 per cent. Not only that, Charles Kennedy remained the most popular party leader by some margin. Despite his popularity falling during the course of the year, his net rating was still +23 by December (compared with −16 for Blair and −30 for Duncan‐Smith).

         <p>Lastly, while Sinn Fein's four MPs finally took up their offices and allowances at Westminster, they continued to refuse to take an oath of allegiance to the Queen or enter the debating chamber in Parliament.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>National politics was dominated by the public services. There was apparent widespread dissatisfaction with services but, at the same time, significant opposition to Government plans for reform. Unbowed, the Government continued to press for reforms, promoting the greater involvement of the private sector. In February, the Prime Minister announced that the struggle over reform was one of ‘reformers versus wreckers’. This provoked widespread fury from public sector unions. At the party's conference in Sep‐tember, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, reiterated the Government's support for the injection of private capital to help modernise public services and in the Queen's Speech in November, the commitment to reform public services was re‐affirmed.</p>
         
         <p>There was good news for the public sector following the budget in April. The Chancellor announced the biggest ever increase in health service funding, as well as increases in spending on education, transport and crime. To help fund these increases, a penny in the pound increase in National Insurance contributions was announced. Further plans to increase spending, especially in education were announced in the three‐year spending programme in July.</p>
         
         <p>As far as policy areas were concerned, there was particular dissatisfaction with transport. In January, a parliamentary report criticised the Government for not sufficiently prioritising railways and argued that the railway industry was ‘in chaos’. In March, following the collapse of Railtrack the previous year, the then Transport Secretary, Stephen Byers, announced a reversal in Government policy by pledging £300 million to bail out Railtrack shareholders. In May, the beleaguered Byers was again at the centre of controversy following the departure of his communications director. It was alleged that in announcing the director's resignation, he misled Parliament. Days later, a train crash killed seven people. Byers resigned shortly afterwards.</p>
         
         <p>Education was also a key issue and, like transport, claimed a cabinet minister. Early in the year, the signs were positive for the Government. The annual report by the Chief Inspector of Schools suggested that the quality of education in Britain was improving, while in February, the Government announced reforms that promoted the inclusion of work‐related options in school for 14 to 19 year‐olds to encourage more young people to remain in education and vocational training. However, the summer saw significant problems in the marking of A‐level examinations. The resulting furore saw the Education Secretary, Estelle Morris, resign in October. In December, the Prime Minister took the lead in a debate over higher education, finally declaring that universities were under‐funded. However, he went on to say that additional income could only come from students rather than taxpayers, prompting fears of significant increases in student fees.</p>
         
         <p>Towards the end of the year, the fire service was brought into sharp focus. Following the rejection of a 40 per cent pay claim, the Fire Brigades Union embarked upon a series of strikes for the first time since the 1970s. In the resulting negotiations, a rise of 16 per cent was offered, but tied to reforms in working practices. The union rejected this offer and embarked upon an eight‐day strike in November. A further strike of eight days was narrowly averted in December, but the dispute remained unresolved by the end of the year. The dispute also claimed a political casualty. The minister responsible for the fire service in Scotland resigned after allegations that he had described striking firemen as ‘fascist bastards’.</p>
         
         <p>The Government also pressed ahead with reforms in law and order. In January, the Home Secretary announced plans for wide‐ranging reform of the police service in England and Wales, which would give the Home Office more say in the running of police forces. The proposals suffered a defeat in the House of Lords in April, but were eventually passed. In February, reforms were announced for prisons, including more open prisons for those convicted of non‐violent crimes, while in July, the Government criminal justice White Paper <i>Justice For All</i> was published. Proposals included previous acquittals and previous convictions being made admissible as evidence in court.
         </p>
         
         <p>Europe and the euro were key issues that divided the parties. While twelve European countries introduced the Euro on 1 January, the United Kingdom was a notable absentee from the Eurozone. By June, there was speculation that Britain would soon join following sterling's continued fall against the euro. At the same time, Gordon Brown reiterated his view that if Britain's so‐called ‘five economic tests’ were met, then the Euro should be introduced into the United Kingdom.</p>
         
         <p>In September, the Government expressed more pro‐European sentiments. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called for a European Constitution as a means of reconnecting ‘European voters with institutions that act in their name’. This stance divided the opposition parties. While the Liberal Democrats supported the Government, the Conservative shadow foreign secretary warned of the dangers of moving towards a European superstate. As for public opinion, hostility remained towards the adoption of the Euro. Throughout the year, more than 50 per cent of those polled said they would vote against adopting the Euro in a referendum, while the proportion in favour showed no sign of growing. Not only that, a poll of chief executives published in September showed that only one in five favoured early entry into the Eurozone.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the new Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act (introduced in 2001), questions continued to be asked about the probity of party finances. First, in January it emerged that the collapsed Enron energy company had sponsored Labour Party events since 1997 to the sum of around £36,000. The company had acquired Wessex Water without a regulatory review and had had a number of meetings with senior officials over British energy policy. Second, it was revealed in February that in 2001 the Prime Minister wrote a letter in support of LNM Holdings in their efforts to acquire a Romanian steel company. The owner of the company, Lakshmi Mittal, had previously made a donation to the Labour Party of £125,000. Third, after a £32 million contract for a smallpox vaccine was awarded to Powderject by the Government, it emerged that the chairman and chief executive of the company, Paul Drayson, had made two separate donations to Labour of £50,000. Finally, it was revealed that following the successful take‐over of Express Group newspapers by the Northern and Shell group the previous year (which was not contested by the Department of Trade and Industry), the owner, Richard Desmond, had made a donation to Labour of £100,000. Further embarrassment was caused by the fact that Desmond's group also publishes pornographic material. In response to these episodes (particularly the last of them), Labour set up an ethics committee to vet all large donations and stipulate that all donors agree that their donations are not intended to deliver commercial advantage. Despite the fact that no wrongdoing was shown in any of these cases, it still prompted calls for further state funding of parties and caps on the size of donations. However, despite these calls, no changes were forthcoming.</p>
         
         <p>The impact of the devolutionary measures continued to be apparent. In February, it was announced that in line with the Scotland Act of 1998, the number of Scottish MPs would be reduced from 72 to 59 to reflect the existence of the new Scottish Parliament and the over‐representation of Scotland at Westminster. Later that month, the Welsh Assembly announced that student grants would be reintroduced for low‐income families in Wales, while in Scotland, the Scottish Parliament made hunting illegal. In May, the Government announced proposals for elected regional assemblies in England. However, devolution was not wholly popular. In August, the Scottish First Minister conceded that the first two years of the Scottish Parliament had been a disappointment to the people of Scotland, while the Welsh First Minister also acknowledged that the Assembly ‘still had a long way to go to convince the voters of its value’. Nevertheless, Plaid Cymru argued, in its annual conference, for the Welsh Assembly to be granted the same powers as the Scottish Parliament.</p>
         
         <p>The Government continued to have difficulties related to rural Britain. Although January saw the United Kingdom being declared free of foot‐ and‐mouth disease, the report on the outbreak, published in July, was critical of the Government's handling of the crisis. The issue of foxhunting also refused to disappear. In September, the Countryside Alliance, an umbrella organisation brought together in opposition to plans to ban hunting, again staged a march in London. An estimated 400,000 attended. In December, when MPs were discussing the Hunting Bill, there were violent scenes outside Parliament.</p>
         
         <p>Inevitably, given the events of the previous year, terrorism continued to provide an important focus. In January, Tony Blair announced that the United Kingdom was ready to take a leading role in the fight against terrorism, and by April the focus of much attention was Iraq. The Prime Minister told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that the fullest possible consensus would be sought before any military offensive was launched on Iraq. However, by July, he told the House of Commons that while it would be properly consulted on any such move, it would not be guaranteed a vote on the involvement of British forces. In September, the Iraq crisis was such that Parliament was recalled and, by November, the United States had formally requested the use of British forces in any such conflict. November also saw a national terror warning from the Home Office that al‐Qaeda could unleash a poison gas attack on Britain.</p>
