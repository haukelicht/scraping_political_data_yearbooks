         <p>The completely dominating event in Sweden in 2006 was the parliamentary election held in September, which led to a change of government. The Social Democratic Party had been in power as a single‐party government since 1994 – from 1998, courtesy of parliamentary support from the Left and Green parties. In the 2006 election, however, the four‐party centre‐right Alliance for Sweden secured an overall majority of seven seats and formed a coalition. It was the first majority government in Sweden since 1981. During the year, there were important personnel changes in the old Social Democratic Government, as well as in the new centre‐right coalition.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Election to the national parliament</h2>
         
         <p>Against the odds, the parliamentary cooperation pact between the governing Social Democratic Party and the Left and Green support parties survived an entire second election period. Nevertheless, as the election approached, a change of Government was always on the cards. The Social Democrats were faring badly in opinion polls, and Prime Minister Göran Persson's personal ratings were also negative. In some ways this was remarkable. The Government was not able to reap the benefits of an essentially healthy economy, with a strong output, low inflation and the fiscal situation under control. The key problem was that the strong economy was not sufficiently translated into jobs. The Government was forced to concede that it would fail to meet its targets of an ‘open’ unemployment rate (excluding those in public labour market schemes) of 4 per cent, and an employment level of 80 per cent among those aged 20–64.</p>
         
         <p>In addition, there had been a number of more or less serious scandals involving the Government as a whole, as well as individual ministers. Most damaging was the handling of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. The Government's slow response, and lack of organisational preparations to deal with a disaster of this scale, were heavily criticised throughout 2005. The debate resurfaced in 2006, first in April, when the parliamentary Committee on the Constitution presented a critical report, and again in late August, when the Justice Ombudsman issued more criticism. The latter report led to the resignation of Mr Lars Danielsson, one of Goran Persson's chief aides in international affairs. Danielsson was criticised for giving unclear evidence to a Commission of Inquiry (the Hirschfeldt Commission; see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2006</a></span>) and to the Committee on the Constitution. Although not a member of the cabinet, Danielsson was a senior employee in the government organisation, and his forced resignation was damaging.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, the opposition had grown in strength and confidence. In late August 2004, the Moderate Party, the People's Party Liberals, and Centre Party and the Christian Democrats had formed Alliance for Sweden in order to mount a coherent challenge against the Social Democrats (see <span title=""><a href="#b4%20#b5" id="#b4 #b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2005, 2006</a></span>). There is a long history of untimely disagreements among the centre‐right parties, and the purpose behind the creation of the Alliance was to minimise the risks of new splits. The Alliance parties entered and fought the election as separate parties, but openly declared their intention to form a four‐party government. The joint brand name, the Alliance (<i>Alliansen</i>), became established in the media. Most importantly, the Alliance presented an election manifesto, based on a total of 16 policy agreements, in late August. This, the first‐ever joint manifesto by the centre‐right parties, emphasised job creation. It included proposals for cuts in unemployment benefits, as well as tax deductions for low and medium incomes, to stimulate a growth in employment.
         </p>
         
         <p>The campaign can be described as lively, and the year contained a number of ‘affairs’ related to the election. In the winter, an official in the Social Democratic Party office was exposed as having spread defamatory emails about Moderate leader Fredrik Reinfeldt. In late August, a young Christian Democrat was reported to have posed as a Social Democrat in an attempt to get access to the campaign planning of the latter party. Most serious, however, was the ‘Intrusion Affair’, which broke on 3 September. It was revealed that an employee of the youth organisation of the People's Party Liberals had hacked into SAPnet, the intranet of the Social Democrats. The scandal soon escalated. The party secretary of the People's Party Liberals was forced to resign when it became clear that he initially had not given honest answers when asked how long he had been aware of the intrusion, and other party officials were also implicated. It is questionable how crucial the information gained really was, but the Social Democrats claimed that there had been cases where responses by the People's Party Liberals to policy initiatives earlier in the year had been uncannily well timed. A police investigation followed, and court proceedings will take place in 2007.</p>
         
         <p>The victory margin for the Alliance was clear, although it did not amount to a landslide. There were, however, notable highs and lows for the individual parties. The Social Democratic result of 35 per cent was the party's worst in a parliamentary election since 1914, and underlined the fact that its support base, which in the 1980s still had a minimum level of over 40 per cent, is eroding. The disappointing performance had three main causes. First, the party was on the defensive regarding jobs. The lingering unemployment, despite the strong economy, was difficult to handle for a party with employment as its traditional profile issue. The Alliance also pointed out that the unemployment statistics did not give the full picture as a high proportion of the potential workforce were on long‐term sick leave or in early retirement schemes. This phenomenon, labelled ‘outsiderness’, was a key theme in the Alliance campaign. Above all, the Social Democrats' tried and trusted recipe of pouring more resources into labour market and training schemes did not seem to compare favourably with the Alliance's incentive‐based proposals.</p>
         
         <p>A second factor was the respective credibility of the two government alternatives. The Alliance parties presented a joint election manifesto, and were completely clear about their plans to form a four‐party coalition. The Social Democrats, meanwhile, were unable to declare whether they would form a coalition with one or both of its support parties. The official Social Democratic line – that it sought a renewed mandate for a single‐party government – lacked all credibility. Both support parties, in particular the Greens, had declared that a formal coalition was the only feasible way to continue cooperation. This, together with the earlier mentioned scandals, meant that the Social Democrats had lost one of its traditional advantages – namely that it was seen as the party most fit to govern.</p>
         
         <p>A third factor was personalities. Göran Persson had been an electoral asset in 2002, but was a liability in 2006. His leadership style was criticised as authoritarian and arrogant, and contrasted negatively against the reasoned and thoughtful Reinfeldt. Persson announced his resignation as party leader around three hours after the polling stations closed. A successor will be appointed at an extraordinary party congress in March 2007.</p>
         
         <p>The big winner in the election was the Moderate Party, which recorded its best result since 1928. It was a vindication of Fredrik Reinfeldt's attempts to move the party towards the centre ground. In the campaign material, the party referred to itself the ‘New Moderates’. When asked what was new, party representatives responded that the proposed tax cuts had more of a low‐income profile than before. The low‐income profile was also manifested in the slogan ‘Sweden needs a new workers party’. Indeed, poll data from VALU indicated that 8 per cent of Social Democratic voters in 2002 went to the Moderates in 2006; the biggest loss the Social Democrats has suffered (VALU 2006). The other Alliance parties were largely overshadowed by the Moderates. The Centre Party made a modest gain, while the People's Party Liberals and the Christian Democrats suffered losses. In the former case, the result may to some extent be attributed to the intrusion affair, but opinion polls indicated a loss for People's Party Liberals before the story broke, and there is no clear evidence that the scandal was a major factor. A record 5.7 per cent voted for parties that did not meet the 4 per cent representational threshold. By far the biggest of the parties outside Parliament was the anti‐immigration Sweden Democrats, with 2.9 per cent. Other unsuccessful parties (none of which received 1 per cent of the vote) included the Eurosceptic June List, which was unable to repeat its success in the 2004 European Union election, and the Feminist Initiative, whose candidates included former Left Party leader Gudrun Schyman. The prospect of a change of government drove up interest in the election, and turnout rose from 80.11 to 81.99 per cent (see also <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt forthcoming</a></span>).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Cabinet report</h2>
         
         <p>There was one change in the Social Democratic Government before the election. Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds, who had taken over from the assassinated Anna Lindh in 2003, was heavily criticised in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. It was, however, other events that forced her resignation. Following the controversy over the cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed published in the Danish newspaper <i>Jyllands‐Posten</i> (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Bille 2006</a></span>), a competition with invitations to submit more cartoons on the same theme was published on the website of the Sweden Democrats. This was heavily criticised in Sweden, and also led to reactions in Islamic countries. On 9 February, the web host Levonline closed down two websites related to the Sweden Democrats. It soon transpired that the closures had been preceded by a representation from a Foreign Ministry official to Levonline. Freivalds denied knowledge of any attempts to put pressure on Levonline, but was later forced to admit that she had been aware of the contact before it had taken place. This made her position untenable, and she resigned on 20 March. After an interim period with Carin Jämtin in charge, the 65 year‐old Jan Eliasson took over as Foreign Minister on 24 April. An experienced diplomat, Eliasson had held high positions in the United Nations (UN) and served under Social Democratic Foreign Ministers between 1994 and 2000. In December 2006, Eliasson was appointed the UN envoy in Darfur in western Sudan.
         </p>
         
         <p>In a vote of investiture on 5 October, the 41 year‐old Fredrik Reinfeldt became the youngest Swedish Prime Minister since the Social Democrat Rickard Sandler in 1925. He presented his 22‐strong cabinet the following day. The Moderate Party took exactly half of the posts, including the key positions of Finance and Foreign Affairs. The choice of Carl Bildt as Foreign Minister took most commentators by surprise. Bildt had been the leader of the Moderate Party from 1986 to 1999, and was Prime Minister of a four‐party centre right minority coalition from 1991 to 1994, but seemed to have left party politics after retiring from the party leadership. He has served on missions for the European Union (EU) and the UN in the Balkans, and also been associated with a number of international businesses and think tanks. His appointment was seen as an acknowledgment of Reinfeldt's lack of experience in international matters. Anders Borg, a close aide of Reinfeldt and one of the architects behind the transformation of the Moderate Party, became Minister of Finance. The Moderate Party also took the important posts of Justice (Beatrice Ask) and Defence (Mikael Odenberg).</p>
         
         <p>The Centre Party and the People's Party Liberals got four posts each, and the Christian Democrats three. By and large, the smaller parties concentrated their representatives into their respective profile areas. Centre leader Maud Olofsson became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Enterprise, and her party was also handed its traditional areas of Agriculture (Eskil Erlandsson) and the Environment (Andreas Carlgren). The leader of the People's Party Liberals, Lars Leijonborg, took charge of the Ministry for Education, and deputy leader Jan Björklund became Minister for Schools. The People's Party Liberals was also handed EU Affairs (Cecilia Malmström) and Ethnic Integration and Gender Equality (Nyamko Sabuni, born in Burundi). Christian Democrat leader Göran Hägglund became Minister for Social Affairs, and his party also took the posts of Health and Care of Elderly (Maria Larsson) and Local Government and Financial Markets (Mats Odell).</p>
         
         <p>The initial gender balance of the Government was 12 men and 10 women, and the average age was 47 – in both cases, minor changes compared to the Social Democratic predecessors. Of the 22 ministers, only five had never been elected to the national parliament (Malmström had been a member of the European Parliament). This was a notably lower proportion than in recent Social Democratic Governments. Three ministers had previous government experience; Bildt, Ask and Odell had served in the 1991–1994 cabinet.</p>
         
         <p>The new government ran into difficulties almost immediately. Two ministers, both from the Moderate Party, were forced to resign within days. Maria Borelius (Foreign Trade) and Cecilia Stegö Chiló (Culture) had used the services of black market childminders without paying employers fees, and failed to pay their television licences. They had openly declared their child care arrangements, but the television licence evasions were exposed by investigative journalists. Borelius’ undoing was her attempts to explain why she had used black market child care at a time when she was shown to have had a high income. She was also reported to have made other tax‐evading arrangements. For Stegö Chiló, the main problem was the failure to pay her television licence. It was reported that she had done so for ideological reasons, which was compromising as her remit included the media. Borelius resigned eight days after her appointment and Stegö Chiló two days later. This was highly embarrassing for Reinfeldt as many had questioned his judgement in selecting the two ministers. Replacements were in place in less than two weeks. Sten Tolgfors took over Foreign Trade, while Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth became Minister of Culture. Both had parliamentary experience. Their appointments did not affect the Government's party or age composition, but it shifted the gender balance from 12:10 to 13:9.</p>

         <p>The political year was dominated by the election and the change of Government. Despite the initial problems, the prospects for the Alliance Government seemed positive. It took over a strong economy, and could concentrate on its reform programme rather than crisis management. The measures to stimulate job creation, outlined in the Alliance manifesto, were initiated in the first budget, presented to parliament on 16 October. Some proposals (notably on unemployment benefit) were met with protests, but the Government argued that this was balanced by other reforms such as tax cuts for those on low and medium incomes. The Government also envisaged the closure of a number of state agencies and the sale of state‐owned companies. Early poll indications suggested a negative public response. The effectively leaderless Social Democrats saw their poll ratings rise after the election and, by the end of the year, the Social Democrat/Left/Green bloc was ahead of the Alliance.</p>
         
         <p>The economy remained strong. According to figures published in January 2007 by the National Debt office, there was a fiscal surplus for 2006 amounting to SEK18 billion (approx. €2 billion); a marginal increase on the surplus from 2005. The national debt shrank by SEK39 billion (€4.3 billion) to SEK1,270 billion (€141 billion), and declined relative to GDP by four percentage points to 45 per cent. The growth rate went up from 2.8 per cent in 2005 to 4.8 per cent in 2006, according to a report published in March 2006 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER). This was the highest growth rate since 1970. Ironically, open unemployment fell below the Social Democratic target level of 4 per cent shortly after the election. The annual average unemployment for 2006 was 4.6 per cent of the workforce, according to statistics from the Swedish National Labour Market Administration. This was a decline compared to 2005, but the proportion involved in labour market schemes rose from 2.7 to 3 per cent, which meant a total unemployment rate of 7.6 per cent. According to NIER, the employment rate among those aged 20–64 rose marginally to 77.7 per cent in 2006. The Social Democratic target level of 80 per cent was projected to be reached in 2008. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12 month changes in Consumer Price Index) fluctuated between 0.6 and 1.7 per cent in 2006, which was higher than in 2005, but within the central bank's (<i>Riksbanken</i>) target of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point. However, the NIER predicted increased inflationary pressure and possible interest rate rises in 2008 and beyond.
