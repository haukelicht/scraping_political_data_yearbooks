         <p>The year started badly for the governing Liberal Party and never improved. The new minority Martin Cabinet rarely seemed to be in control of its party, legislature or government. A Commons defeat in late November finally put it out of its misery and launched a general election less than a year‐and‐a‐half after the country had last gone to the polls.</p>
         
         <p>In part the Liberals' difficulties stemmed from the fragmented character of national politics and the precarious position in which it was left after the 2004 election. The party was forced to form a minority government for the first time since the 1970s and, with the conservative side of the system united for the first time since 1993, the Liberals now faced a real opposition. Yet more debilitating was the continuing odor of political scandal flowing from ongoing revelations of partisan kickback schemes in testimony before an independent Commission of Inquiry (the Gomery Commission) and the government's own inability to define a clear set of priorities and programs. This allowed the opposition to keep the government on the defensive and eventually led to its collapse.</p>
         
         <p>The first sign of trouble came in early January when the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was forced to resign amid charges of providing improper help to campaign workers. Although she was exonerated several months later, the damage to her career and to the party was significant, reinforcing a public image of the Liberals as willing to engage in corrupt or illegal political practices to win office. The following month saw both Prime Minister Martin and his predecessor, Jean Chrétien, reduced to defending their actions and reputations in testimony to the Gomery Commission. Martin was anxious to distance himself and his government from Chrétien's, but having been Finance Minister during the years in question, his assertions of ignorance and innocence left many observers somewhat incredulous. Perhaps more to the point, the claims worked to aggravate the deep divisions in the party created by Martin's successful campaign to unseat Chrétien as leader (<span title=""><a href="#b1%20#b2%20#b3" id="#b1 #b2 #b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2003, 2004</a></span>). In April, in the face of mounting public pressure and opposition threats to vote no confidence in the government, Martin went on television to promise he would call an election within thirty days of receiving Justice Gomery's report. This bought him a little time.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the meantime, the government was having difficulty moving on a legislative agenda. It was only able to pass a budget after the New Democratic Party (NDP) exacted about CAN$4.6 billion worth of concessions on taxes and social spending. That allowed the NDP to claim they were driving important parts of the agenda and gave New Democrat MPs a reason to sustain the government. Determined to show a progressive face that sharply differentiated them from the Conservatives, the Liberals introduced a Bill providing for same‐sex marriage. Almost inevitably it proved very controversial and was particularly difficult for many Liberal parliamentarians given their party's deep roots in the Roman Catholic community. Before the parliamentary struggle was over, the Liberals had one backbench MP abandon the caucus and one Minister, Joe Comuzzi, quit the government rather than support the Bill. It ultimately passed, but only with the active support of the NDP and <i>Bloc québécois</i> caucuses.
         </p>
         
         <p>In early May, a resolution calling on the government to resign passed by a vote of 153 to 150, but the Liberals refused to recognize it as a legitimate declaration of no confidence. This set the stage for a dramatic showdown with a formal motion of confidence set for 19 May. In the days leading up to the vote the outcome was uncertain, although an alliance between the Conservatives and Bloc appeared to hold the slimmest possible advantage despite the New Democrats' willingness to prop the government up a little longer. Then, on the day before the vote, the Prime Minister dramatically announced that he was welcoming Belinda Stronach into the Liberal Party and appointing her to his cabinet. Nothing could have been less expected. Stronach was a front bench Conservative, an important new urban Ontario face in the party whose emergence she had helped midwife, who had run second in the Conservative's inaugural leadership contest little more than a year before. Liberals saw this move as a clever coup; their opponents saw it as the most cynical form of vote‐buying by a desperate government.</p>
         
         <p>The vote now turned on the decision of an Independent British Columbia MP, Chuck Cadman who had previously served as a Reform and then Alliance (parties now incorporated into the Conservatives) MP. Having lost a local nomination fight in 2004 Cadman managed the near impossible and was returned as an Independent. Now seriously ill with cancer, he had taken little part in the parliamentary session so it was not clear if he could make the long trip to Ottawa or, if he did, what he would do once there. Would he vote to sustain the government or would he support his former colleagues and vote for an early election? After much (and well‐publicized) consultation with his constituents, Cadman made the five‐hour plane trip to support the government. When the vote was tallied the House split 152–152 and, for the first time in Canadian history, the Speaker was called on to break a tie on a confidence motion. Following well‐established precedent, Speaker Milliken voted to sustain the government.</p>
         
         <p>It was clear the government's days were numbered: the Liberals hoped to postpone the day of reckoning until after Judge Gomery reported, and their opponents wanted to strike while the Liberals' popularity and credibility was low. In mid‐June, the government was regularly challenged but survived some 15 votes, any one of which might have forced an election, and after end‐of‐session wrangling on the final stage of the same‐sex legislation and the budget, the House recessed for the summer.</p>
         
         <p>August, normally a quiet month politically, saw the Prime Minister announce the appointment of Michaëlle Jean as the new Governor General of Canada. Jean, who had been brought to the country from Haiti as a young girl, was little known outside French‐speaking Canada where she was a prominent journalist on the public broadcasting system. Though the government's opponents attempted to cast doubt on her credentials as a loyal Canadian, it soon became clear that she was a woman of extraordinary grace whose capacities seemed perfectly matched with the challenges of serving as the Queen's representative.</p>
         
         <p>When the House returned in the autumn it appeared that the opposition had reconciled itself to the government's preferred election timetable. However, events soon intervened to again shift the initiative away from the Liberals. In the course of its work, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee summoned David Dingwall, the President of the Canadian Mint, to explain apparently excessive expense accounts. The hearing immediately became intensely partisan for he was a political appointee – a former minister in the Chrétien government. The focus shifted when Dingwall suddenly resigned from the Mint: the expense account issue faded (in the absence of any serious wrongdoing) only to be replaced by a furor over whether Dingwall was to receive a generous separation allowance. In the course of his testimony to the parliamentary committee Dingwall rather haughtily declared: ‘I am entitled to my entitlements.’ For many, that declaration captured the Liberal Party's sense of their entitlement to govern and the opposition parties carefully stored away copies of the tape recording for use in the coming election.</p>
         
         <p>With the publication of the first part of the Gomery Commission report on 1 November, detailing the extent of unearned payments and kickbacks as well as naming those responsible, the opposition determined not to wait for Part Two, which promised to contain reform proposals likely to be of more interest to public administrators than voters. The NDP, having decided it could gain no more advantage out of supporting the government, joined with the Conservatives and the Bloc to bring the government to an end on 28 November. The Prime Minister then decided that the election would be on 23 January, leaving Canadians to face an unusually long winter election.</p>
         
         <p>As the year in national politics drew to a close the Liberals looked to be in serious trouble. The Conservatives were running a more disciplined and focused campaign, the Finance Minister's office was under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for a possible breach of security over taxation change announcements, and a shocking shooting in the country's largest city on the day after Christmas played to voters' fear of crime. The early weeks of the new year will reveal if the Liberals can manage the same kind of last minute campaign recovery they had in 2004 or whether, for the first time in over a decade, Canadian voters are really prepared to see some other party in office.</p>
         
         <p>While much of the country's political attention was focused on the daily tribulations of the national government, movement continued on the electoral reform agenda. Though Ottawa parliamentarians just talked about how they might do electoral reform, politicians and activists in several provinces were actively working at it. On 17 May, at the time of the first fixed‐date election in Canadian history, 57.7 per cent of British Columbia's voters supported an independent Citizens' Assembly recommendation that the province adopt the Single Transferable Vote. This narrowly missed the 60 per cent threshold established by the legislature, but the new government (elected with 45.8 per cent of the vote) soon announced it would hold a further referendum on the issue. In Prince Edward Island, a November referendum saw a proposal for a Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system defeated on a very low turnout after the government changed the passing standard mid‐way through the campaign. Quebec continued legislative hearings into quite a different MMP system; the New Brunswick government continued to study a blue‐ribbon commission's proposal for yet a third distinctive MMP system; and Ontario moved ahead with plans to establish a Citizens' Assembly of its own to consider electoral reform for the country's largest province. While none of these efforts had borne fruit by the end of the year, electoral reform remains a lively issue with the potential to reorder much that is familiar in Canadian politics.</p>
