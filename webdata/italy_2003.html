         <p>The European elections confirmed the traditional Italian pattern of high fragmentation, but at the same time introduced a significant novelty on the side of political supply. As far as fragmentation is concerned, 15 lists won representation in the European Parliament (EP) (actually three less than in the previous election); nine lists elected no more than two MEPs and only two lists received more than ten MEPs. As far as political supply is concerned, the great novelty was provided by the new list <i>Uniti nell’Ulivo</i> (United in the Olive Tree), which combined four parties: DS, Daisy, SDI and European Republicans. This list was the final product of a long process of convergence initiated the year before by former Prime Minister and President of the European Union (EU) Commission, Romano Prodi. The solid support to that project provided by the DS, the major party in the centre‐left, assured the success of the proposal. The DS endorsement was particularly important because it finally overcame the rift between the party and Mr Prodi himself, caused by the dramatic overturn of the Prodi government in 1998. In strategic terms, the list was meant to represent the first step towards the creation of a large ‘reformist’ party that could act as the pivot within the centre‐left; in tactical terms, it was considered a tool to establish the party as the largest one in the Italian party system, depriving <i>Forza Italia</i> of that distinction.
         </p>
         
         <p>The list <i>Uniti nell’Ulivo</i> actually came first with 31.1 per cent of the votes, while the second party, <i>Forza Italia</i>, collected 21.0 per cent. If the tactical goal had been achieved, the result, on the other hand, undermined the strategy. The percentage of <i>Uniti nell’Ulivo</i> was in fact slightly inferior to the sum of the votes collected in the general election of 2001 by the four parties gathered into the list (even if it is difficult to make a precise comparison given the mergers and splits that occurred in the meantime). This outcome depressed the initial enthusiasm and was to produce, later in the year, some tensions: the Daisy, in particular, intended to slow down the unification process in order to keep their partisan profile.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the whole, however, the centre‐left for the first time ever surpassed the centre‐right: 46.1 to 45.5 per cent. On the centre‐right, the electoral results enfeebled Mr. Berlusconi's leadership. Notwithstanding that the Prime Minister himself had been a candidate in each constituency (while he was ineligible), <i>Forza Italia</i> lost heavily: −4.2 per cent compared to the 1999 European elections and −4.1 per cent compared to the 2001 general election. Its coalition partners, on the other hand, kept their votes or even increased their share, depending on which election is taken as the reference point. At any rate, <i>Forza Italia</i>– and the Prime Minister personally – were no longer considered the uncontested, absolute heads of the coalition. The immediate and quite traumatic fall of the Minister of the Treasury was the first sign of a changed balance of power within the House of Freedom.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, the European election highlighted some changes in the electoral geography. The DS, and in part the Daisy, eroded some centre‐right bastions in the North, especially in Piedmont, and the Catholic moderate UDC made an impressive leap forward in the deep south, especially in Sicily. On the other hand, <i>Forza Italia</i> lost everywhere: it came out as the first party in only 16 provinces out of 101. Last but not least, turnout increased compared to 1999 by 1.9 per cent.
         </p>

         <p>The year 2004 represented a turning point in the balance between the two competing political coalitions of centre‐right (the House of Freedom –<i>Casa delle Libertà</i>) and centre‐left (the Olive Tree –<i>L’Ulivo</i>). For the first time since the 2001 general elections, the voters were called to the polls for a nationwide electoral contest: the European elections. On that occasion the centre‐left overtook, even if by only a narrow margin (37 to 36 MEPs), the government parties; but rather than the European elections alone, all the other local elections and the numerous by‐elections provided the centre‐left with very positive results, indicating a change of mood in public opinion.
         </p>
         
         <p>One of the local elections in particular was perceived as ‘the’ test for the recovery of the centre‐left. It concerned the vote for the mayor in Bologna. The capital of the Emilia‐Romagna region, a bastion of the left for as long as anyone can remember, to the universal surprise and utter disgrace of the dominant left‐wing party, the DS (<i>Democratici di sinistra</i>– Left Democrats) had been conquered in 1999 by an independent candidate supported by the centre‐right. The comeback of the left in Bologna was thus considered the signal of the left's resurgence. The DS, again to general surprise, nominated the former charismatic leader of the leftist (and largely majoritarian) CGIL trade‐union, Sergio Cofferati. In previous years, under his leadership, the CGIL led a hard‐line opposition against the social and economic policy of the Berlusconi government. Even if this stand had the price of (temporarily) distancing the CGIL from the other, more moderate and less relevant, trade unions (CISL and UIL), it put Mr Cofferati on the stage by portraying him as the brave and ultimate opponent to the government in a period of profound disarray of the party opposition (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ignazi 2004</a></span>). When he quit as the head of the trade union at the end of 2003 – as repeatedly announced since the year before – one would have expected a national political role for him, particularly given his rift with the leadership of his own party, the DS. His unexpected candidacy to be Mayor of Bologna, on the contrary, provided a Pareto optimum: on the one hand, it offered a splendid opportunity for a landslide victory for the centre‐left (as in fact happened), and on the other, it eliminated a potential competitor for the leadership of the centre‐left and /or the DS.
         </p>
         
         <p>The European elections had a direct impact on the stability of the centre‐right government. As described in the previous section, the loser of the electoral competition was <i>Forza Italia</i> (Go Italy!), the Prime Minister's party. Compared to the 1999 European elections, it lost 4.2 percentage points, whereas the minor Catholic UDC (<i>Unione Democratica di Centro</i>– Centre Democratic Union) increased its votes and Gianfranco Fini's <i>Alleanza nazionale</i> (National Alliance) more or less kept its support. These results heightened the tensions that had been mounting since the previous year. The challenge concerned the Prime Minister, flanked by the <i>Lega Nord</i> (Northern League) on one side, and AN plus the UDC on the other. The rift centred upon a more relevant role for AN – the second party in the coalition – especially with regard to socio‐economic policies. These tensions broke out in a violent conflict between the Treasury Minister Giulio Tremonti and the Vice‐Prime Minister and AN leader Gianfranco Fini (backed by the UDC leader, Marco Follini) on the supposed disdain for lower‐middle‐class interests displayed by the Treasury Minister's economic policy: actually, his policy was considered the cause of the electoral defeat. Finally, the up‐until‐then very powerful Treasury Minister was asked to resign by the Prime Minister himself in order to save the government; he was replaced by the former general director of the Ministry, the independent and well‐regarded economics professor, Domenico Siniscalco.
         </p>
         
         <p>This change in government was positively received by both coalitions: it was greeted as the final resolution of the internal quarrels within the coalition by the centre‐right, and as the coming of a more accountable and responsible management of the economy by the centre‐left. Actually, the new Minister failed to meet either expectation. The fights inside the centre‐right continued and the government's composition changed again later in the year; in November, Gianfranco Fini finally achieved his long‐awaited international legitimation by entering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where he took over from Franco Frattini who was sent to the EU Commission in substitution for Rocco Buttiglione, who was rejected by the EP for his outrageous and provocative homophobic declarations. In December, Mr Berlusconi finally convinced the UDC leader Follini to enter government with the function of Vice‐Prime Minister, in an attempt to reduce the repeated criticisms addressed to the government by Mr Follini himself.</p>
         
         <p>On the other side of the political spectrum, the new Treasury Minister had raised expectations concerning: transparency in the real status of the Italian economy and public finance; rigorous control of the public debt and of the current deficit, as the EU commission had already threatened an early warning for the passing of the 3 per cent deficit/GNP ratio; and structural interventions in the economy instead of the so‐called ‘creative finance’ pursued by his predecessor. All these expectations were to dissolve in the short run. The new Minister was not able to counter the pressure from Mr Berlusconi and his entourage for a substantial continuation of the previous approach and, even more, for a highly risky income tax cut. The fiscal reduction was seen by Berlusconi as the ‘lethal weapon’ to recover consensus in public opinion. And notwithstanding the perplexities by Mr Siniscalco, it was rapidly approved. Actually, given the macro‐economic constraints, the amount of the reduction proved inadequate for any purpose: it was too limited for higher incomes to possibly implant a positive dynamic of investments, too modest for lowest incomes to relieve them from the economic crisis, and finally almost imperceptible for middle incomes. Berlusconi's attempt to ride the anti‐tax feeling, in accordance with his growing populist drive, well depicted by public declarations such as ‘whoever has a tax burden higher than 50 per cent of its income is legitimate to break the fiscal law’ (sic!) (<i>Corriere della Sera</i>, 17 February 2004), in order to recover his party's and his government's fortunes, did not succeed. In other words, the centre‐right coalition and, in consequence, the government itself, entered a phase of intense turmoil that the poor electoral performance at the European elections had, at the same time, highlighted and aggravated.
         </p>
         
         <p>To sum up, the declining fate of the centre‐right is linked to a series of factors. First and most relevant is the worsening of economic conditions and the spread of gloomy sentiments <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the future, even among the centre‐right constituency. The brutal collapse in consumption reveals the citizens’ outlook more clearly than the GNP and the stagnation of industrial activity. The ‘new economic miracle’ repeatedly announced in the 2001 elections has provoked a backlash; if the government will not be able to provide an economic recovery, its fate will become very doubtful.
         </p>
         
         <p>Second, the relationship of the centre‐right with interest groups had changed dramatically. While the government was able to open a divide among the three trade unions by isolating the leftist CGIL, the poor social policy enforced during the year produced a recovery of the unitary front of the trade unions in opposition to the government. Among the industrialists, the openly and hearty pro‐government former president of Confindustria was replaced by the much more critical (and much more glamorous) president of Ferrari, Mr Luca Cordero di Montezemolo.</p>
         
         <p>Third, the disappearance from daily politics of the outspoken <i>Lega Nord</i> leader Umberto Bossi, hit by a devastating heart attack in March, left Berlusconi without his main ally in the coalition. As no other <i>Lega</i> sub‐leader has the political persona to supplant Bossi, the Prime Minister has not been in a position to manage the unrest of the two other partners of the coalition (AN and UDC); the brutal firing of Treasury Minister Giulio Tremonti, who had acted in those years as bridge between <i>Forza Italia</i> and the <i>Lega Nord</i>, was possible only due to Bossi's absence.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the other side of the political spectrum, the centre‐left enjoyed a change of mood for the first time in many years. Beyond the positive results of the European and other elections, the centre‐left was able to settle – at least for a while – its internal quarrels thanks to the unanimous endorsement of the President of the EU Commission, Romano Prodi, as leader of the coalition. Everyone from the leftist hardliner <i>Rifondazione Comunista</i> (Communist Refoundation) to the quite moderate Catholic UDEUR acclaimed Prodi as the leader‐to‐be of the centre‐left. On 13 February, the proposal launched by Prodi a year earlier for a unified list for the upcoming European elections was enthusiastically approved by four parties of the coalition, including the two major ones, DS and the Daisy, plus the two minor socialist and European republican parties. The other parties – the left‐radical <i>Rifondazione Comunista</i> and <i>Comunisti Italiani</i> (Italian Communists), the Greens, the more moderate <i>Italia dei Valori</i> (Values of Italy) and UDEUR – did not join the unified list, but accepted both Prodi's leadership and participation in the federation of all the opposition parties, the <i>Grande Alleanza Democratica</i> (Great Democratic Alliance).
         </p>
         
         <p>The highly consensual climate did not survive the European elections unscathed. The electoral outcome of the unitary list was positive, but not overwhelming. While it kept the same share of the votes collected separately by the parties in the previous election (and this was already a positive outcome), it did not go beyond that line; in other words, the unitary list did not made a significant leap forward. The supposed inability to attract votes from the moderate constituency still supporting the centre‐right or waiting in abstention was at the heart of the rift that in the second half of the year opposed the (relatively) young and ambitious leader of the Daisy, Francesco Rutelli (centre‐left prime ministerial candidate in 2001) and Romano Prodi, precisely on the question of the unified list and the process of federation of the centre‐left parties. While the latter pushed for the creation of a ‘reformist party’ that would unify the majority of the centre‐left parties (and the unified list was intended as a first step in that direction), the former wanted to soft‐pedal the process in order to preserve each party's identity. In sum, this strategic cleavage, which appeared to be solved at the beginning of year with the unified list at the European elections, came back again at the end of the year with renewed intensity and divisive force.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the relationship between the judiciary and the government continued to be quite abrasive. One reason is the continuing judicial ordeal of the Prime Minister and of his associates. In a trial involving Berlusconi and his lawyer Cesare Previti, charged with bribery and judicial corruption, the Prime Minister was acquitted while his lawyer was found guilty. In another trial, Marcello Dell’Utri, the head of one of Berlusconi's companies and his long‐time friend and partner, was found guilty of ‘external support to the Mafia’ and sentenced to eight years in prison. Another reason concerns the hotly debated reform of the judicial system introduced by the government. This reform was heavily contested by almost all of the magistrates because they feared they would lose their autonomy <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> political power. Actually the reform was not signed by the President of the Republic, who sent it back to Parliament for revision. This move deepened the internal tensions within the majority, divided between the fierce supporters of the reform (<i>Forza Italia</i> and <i>Lega Nord</i>) and the undecided (AN and, above all, UDC).
