         <p>The year 2015 in Finland was characterised by the economic stagnation that has continued since 2008, giving fuel to political bickering and an electoral campaign with little if any optimism in sight. Finland's export industry has lost its competitive strength to neighbouring countries and public expenditures have increasingly been financed by foreign loans. The new non‐socialist cabinet has had huge problems in coming to terms with how to boost the economy by implementing reforms in the labour market and public administration.</p>

         <p>Polls showed a continuing lead for the Centre Party, but with approaching elections and intensifying campaigning the True Finns and National Coalition managed to reduce the Centre Party dominance. The Centre Party chairman touted his career as a successful technology industry millionaire, and in launching the party manifesto he strongly emphasised plans to increase the workforce by 100,000 through investments in the bio‐economy. The idea is to enhance innovative industries to bolster new products from the Finnish ‘green gold’ (i.e., timber), which would employ workers in the suffering peripheral regions. In addition, 100,000 more jobs would be created in other types of business activities. The National Coalition offered a similar agenda, differing only in the timing. Both parties emphasised cuts in public spending and the halting of increases in the mortgage rate which is at an alarming level.</p>
         
         <p>The True Finns followed suit and declared that Finland could not be the social aid office to the whole world. The party called for reduced immigration and lower aid for developing countries. In addition, True Finns declared that the Finnish language should be protected by law, argued that the country's bilingualism (Finnish and Swedish) was too expensive and that measures should be taken to reduce the costs and the number of categories including Scandinavian languages.</p>
         
         <p>The Left Alliance differed from all other parties by supporting more loans to stimulate the economy. The Social Democrats in charge of the Ministry of Finance had problems in convincing voters that their economic policy would have significant positive effects. Just as the opposition True Finns challenged traditional Social Democrat voters with their appeal to protect the poor and lower paid workers, so the opposition Centre Party challenged National Coalition by offering a business‐friendly approach.</p>

         <p>The result of the April parliamentary election showed that all government parties had suffered with the exception of the Swedish People's Party. The Social Democrats lost the most support, followed by the National Coalition Party of Prime Minster Alexander Stubb, which lost its position as the largest party. The second largest party, the Social Democrats, dropped to fourth place. The Centre Party got revenge for its poor 2011 election performance and won 14 new seats to return to its past position as the largest party in Finland's parliament. The True Finns, which had scored huge gains in the 2011 election, lost its momentum (particularly in relation to the resurgent Centre Party) but managed to hold to nearly all of its parliamentary seats. The Greens managed to do fairly well in the election and strengthened their representation in parliament.</p>

         <p>The first round in cabinet formation in Finland goes to the winning party in elections and, in 2015, Centre Party leader Juha Sipilä was responsible for taking the initiative. From the beginning it was clear that he preferred a cabinet with drive, which the former cabinets lacked. A cabinet including many parties has the advantage of having strong support in parliament, but such coalitions may also result in weak government efficacy as much work has to be done to find compromises and amendments are often watered down. The True Finns declared in the campaign a willingness to be included in cabinet but not together with the Swedish People's Party or the Greens whom they regard as their worst ideological enemies.</p>

         <p>Sipilä declared that the voice of voters would be seriously considered, and after talking to all parties in parliament and excluding one after another, the remaining three were the largest parties in parliament. The new government's base is conservative (National Coalition), right‐wing populist (True Finns) and moderate (Centre Party). From the outset it was an agreement between Sipilä and True Finns leader Timo Soini, leaving the door open for National Coalition or the Social Democrats. National Coalition with Stubb chose to join Sipilä and Soini, while the Social Democrats, who had suffered losses in one election after another, stepped disappointedly into opposition. The coalition has a majority in parliament but that majority is under risk if one of the coalition parties decides to quit.</p>
         
         <p>The inability of the government to survive without all three parties gave Sipilä’s coalition partners the ability to pressure him in negotiations about portfolios and programme. From the very beginning it was evident that the number of portfolios would be reduced with the intention of saving money and working more efficiently. Different numbers were mentioned but in the end a compromise was found with 14 ministers divided among the three parties. (By comparison, the Katainen cabinet from 2011 to 2014 included 19 portfolios shared by six parties.) The True Finns were expected to take the Finance Ministry portfolio but chairman Timo Soini somewhat unexpectedly chose to be Foreign Minister. The finance portfolio was forwarded to National Coalition chairman Alexander Stubb. This solution surprised many because Stubb had a long experience of foreign affairs and European Union politics while Soini and his party strongly opposed the previous governments’ economic policies.</p>

         <p>The cabinet formulated a programme that was much shorter and less detailed than former government programmes. It showed a strong crisis consciousness and pointed to the fact that Finland's competiveness was 10–15 per cent weaker than key competitor countries while exports had flagged and expertise had not been converted into innovations and commercialisation. The aim of the budget was to cover the €10 billion sustainability gap in public finances to the end of 2021 with one part of the gap to be filled through €4 billion of savings in public finances during the parliamentary term and the rest to be achieved through structural reforms in public administration, including reduced regulations and a reform of health service and social care. A social contract is proposed to reduce labour costs by at least 5 per cent through cooperation with trade unions and employers’ associations. If the plan does not succeed in these goals, the government acknowledged the need to take measures to implement €1.5 billion expenditure cuts and higher taxes. On the other hand, the programme included calls for investment in infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, and in the national defence and police forces.</p>
         
         <p>The government and the programme was heavily criticised by the opposition and the trade unions and supported by the employers’ organisation. Cuts in social welfare will hit the poor and those with low income. Cuts in education will have severe negative impact for universities and other types of higher education and research. The government parties were accused of forgetting their promises not to touch education during the electoral campaign. The True Finns were criticised for defending the poor during the campaign but then accepting even harder burdens for the poor and not for the rich. In addition, the radical cut in aid to developing countries met with anger from opposition parties.</p>

         <p>In December 2014, the Finnish parliament gave permission to proceed in building a new nuclear plant. However, it turned out to be a complicated affair because the plant will be built and partly owned by the Russian Rosatom. The government dismissed concerns that the plan would encounter problems because of the fact that Russia remains under EU sanctions, and in response to criticism about ownership, the government argued that the majority ownership would be in Finnish and not Russian hands. Several Finnish firms left the project, however, and the Finnish Energy Company Fennovoima's plan to include the Croatian firm Solarna Energija came under scrutiny when the latter proved to be the creation of Russian construction interests. Although the process continued, the government ultimately had to drop Solarna Energija because it did not fulfil criteria as a serious European participant and several Finnish companies were hastily involved to secure a majority of Finnish ownership. Widespread critique, especially from the Greens, underlined the security risks of allowing Russians to gain control over Finnish energy production in times when Russia has showed an aggressive willingness to flex its muscles in Eastern Europe, but the government, supported by Rosatom and the Russian government, rejected such fears.</p>

         <p>Prime Minister Sipilä stated his intention to follow up on a longstanding Centre Party promise of implementing a new scheme for regional administration. Finland lacks a coherent regional administration and is currently split into three different sets of administrative functions following different geographical borders. Sipilä’s plan would transfer social welfare and health care, including other administrative functions, to regional governments led by elected councils, and the Centre Party argued that such moves would enhance efficacy, save money and increase democracy. The National Coalition opposed such plans saying that they would increase bureaucracy. The rift in the cabinet on this issue proved to be a deep one and Prime Minister Sipilä threated to leave government if a compromise was not found. Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb and his party took a stand at the outset in favour of five large regions connected to university hospitals, whereas Sipilä and his party supported a plan to introduce 18 regions. A difficult struggle followed that put the fate of the cabinet itself in danger. After nights of wrangling, a meagre compromise was found that would create 18 regions, only 15 of which would have full‐scale service functions because three others lacked hospital service. The asymmetry of the plan suggested that much work remains to be done before the reform sees daylight, and it is an open question what form and content will finally emerge.</p>

         <p>The new Prime Minister enthusiastically announced plans to restore the Finnish economy, launching proposals for a new social contract that would reduce labour costs through longer working days, less vacation time and less compensation for holiday work. Sipilä argued that if an agreement were not reached with among forces in the labour market, the government would take unilateral legal measures to implement cuts in labour costs, and he set a deadline for the participants to come to terms. The proposal was welcomed by the employers’ Confederation of Finnish Industries but rejected by the trade unions, and the proposal was heavily criticised for reducing wages for low‐paid female employees working in hospitals and restaurants. The conflict eliminated any realistic chance of coming to a quick agreement and Sipilä had to face reality. He returned with a new deadline, but no agreement had yet been reached by the end of 2015.</p>
         
         <p>True Finns in government got much publicity when one of the party's MPs, Olli Immonen, posed with members of the neo‐Nazi Finnish National Resistance Movement. A month later, shortly after the anniversary of the massacre at the Norwegian Utøya, Immonen declared war against multiculturalism in his blog. No condemnations from the party followed, and party leader Soini defended Immonen's right to express his will as a private person. Nor did Prime Minster Sipilä act, which was interpreted by some as silent consent but can probably be explained by his desire to avoid internal conflict in cabinet. During the True Finns party congress, delegates declared that true patriotism is to deny refugees and foreigners entrance to Finnish municipalities. And when Foreign Minister Soini faced criticism from media and intellectuals for his failure to take responsibility (especially given his position as Foreign Minister), the True Finns responded by publishing a blacklist of 13 persons named as enemies of the party, including journalists, politicians and three professors (including the author). In another context, True Finn MP Teuvo Hakkarainen inquired in parliament about the introduction of the death penalty in Finland for suspected terrorists, a possibility also previously mentioned by True Finn Minister of Justice Jari Lindström.</p>
         
         <p>The war in Syria spread political waves to Finland as well. The EU proposed in September to impose a system to distribute refugees among Member States to share the burden equally. Finland resisted such attempts. but opened the gates for 2,400 asylum seekers on a voluntary basis, arguing that such decisions should remain in Finnish hands. Later in the year, however, thousands of refugees arrived across the Finland's border with Sweden. The government initiated investigations to reduce social welfare to the refugees citing Finland's weak economic conditions. Demonstrations demanding that Finland to close its borders occurred on the Finnish side of the Swedish border and several violent incidents were reported where activists attacked refugee residential quarters, At the same time, others demonstrated in favour of the refugees. The events proved particularly difficult for the True Finns, who had to face the problems as a member of the government. The refugee question and protection of the low‐paid and unemployed had been key factors in their campaign but events now gave the opposition the chance to criticise them for their inadequate policies. Polls showed a huge drop in the True Finns popularity and the Social Democrats won back their position as the biggest party.</p>
         
         <p>Cuts in welfare benefits were a harsh shock for the low paid and the unemployed. Several projects in the developing world had to be set aside due to cuts in the Finnish budget. More surprising was the impact on education and especially on universities. During the electoral campaign all three parties in government had identified education as the best investment for Finland and promised that no cuts would affect schools and universities. The conservative National Coalition in particular had a track record of protecting higher education, but after the election, the party's Minister of Finance played a key role in significant cuts to universities. The University of Helsinki, for example, faced the prospect of losing several hundred employees. The cuts appeared to be a relatively safe political decision as voters expressed little concern about lower funding for scientific work. The major opposition parties – the Social Democrats and Left Alliance along with the Greens and Swedish People's Party – rejected the cuts, but did so in vain. The year ended in a political climate of pessimism and lack of confidence.</p>
