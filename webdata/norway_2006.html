         <p>The municipal (<i>kommune</i>) and provincial (<i>fylke</i>) elections were held on 10 September. These elections are often regarded as an important ‘midterm test’ both for the Government and the opposition, and national politicians traditionally play a significant role in the local election campaign. The election saw support for the Socialist Left Party halved since the previous local elections. In 2003 they received 12.4 per cent of the votes, while in 2007 they were down to 6.2 per cent. Labour, the Conservatives and the Progress Party gained some support compared to the last local election and received 29.6, 19.3 and 17.5 per cent of the votes, respectively. The Liberals also did well, with an increase from 3.8 to 5.9 per cent. There were no changes for the Christian Peoples Party or the Centre Party. Turnout was low at 61.7 per cent. This was however an increase of 2.5 per cent on 2003, and the first time since 1979 that turnout did not continue to drop in local elections. One of the reasons for this might be that several municipalities improved their advance voting arrangements: 16.7 per cent of the votes were cast in advance (an increase of 4.8 per cent).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg made several changes to the cabinet in 2007. In September, shortly after the local elections, Minister of Petroleum and Energy Odd Roger Enoksen announced that he wanted to resign in order to spend more time with his family in northern Norway. He was replaced by former Minister of Local Government and Regional Development Åslaug Haga. The petroleum and energy industry, as well as environmentalists, were enthusiastic about the change and hoped that the relocation of Haga, who also is the leader of the Centre Party, indicated that Stoltenberg II would strengthen its focus on the sector. The new Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa, had been a Member of Parliament since 1993 and was the Minister of Social Affairs in Bondevik I (1997–2000).</p>
         
         <p>The second round of changes came in October, when three ministers were replaced: two from the Socialist Left Party resigned as a result of longstanding criticism both from the opposition and the media, but more importantly from members of their own party. Minister of Education and Research Øystein Djupedal (SV) had, among other things, been continuously criticised for neglecting higher education and research by only concentrating on fulfilling the promise on preschool education and day care (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg &amp; Brekken 2006</a></span>: 1225). In its 2005 government declaration, Stoltenberg II stressed that an important goal was to ensure that the contribution to research should be raised to 3 per cent of GNP before 2010. However, the government budget for 2007 showed a decline in Stoltenberg II's allocation to research and higher education. MPs from SV also stressed how the party did not have much influence on government educational policies, despite having the Minister of Education. When Mr Djupedal resigned, he was replaced by two new ministers. The new Minister of Education, Bård Vegar Solhjell, became responsible for kindergarten and basic education, whereas the new Minister of Research and Higher Education, Tora Aasland, became responsible for tertiary education and research. Solhjell is vice‐chairman of the Socialist Left Party and was previously State Secretary at the Prime Minister's Office. Aasland came from the position of Regional State Governor and had experience both as a Member of Parliament and as a researcher.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Helen Bjørnøy (SV), had also been continuously criticised for being a weak minister in an area of significant importance for the party. This was illustrated at the beginning of 2007 when Ms Bjørnøy promised that the Government would be more ambitious than the European Union (EU) and reduce emissions of CO<sup>2</sup> by at least 20 per cent of the 1990 level. Prime Minister Stoltenberg (DNA) however, stressed that the Government had not yet quantified the level of reduction, and SV leader and Minister of Finance Halvorsen had to make clear to parliament that the Government had not yet decided on this issue. The media reported that Ms Bjørnøy had been disciplined by the Prime Minister, which only reinforced the impression of a rather weak minister. Ms Bjørnøy was replaced by the Minister of International Development Erik Solheim. Mr Solheim did not, however, want to leave his current post, hence the solution was to appoint him Minister of the Environment and International Development. The department structures were not changed as a result of the reshuffling. Critics argued that it would be too large a responsibility for one minister, but the Prime Minister rejected the criticism and argued that this would emphasise the need to combine environmental strategies with international development.
         </p>
         
         <p>The most surprising change to the cabinet in 2007 was that Prime Minister Stoltenberg asked Minister of Children and Equality Karita Bekkemellem to resign. This was done primarily to appoint Manuela Ramin‐Osmundsen, who became the first minister in 21 years with a non‐Norwegian background.<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> Ms Ramin‐Osmundsen, who became a Norwegian citizen only 14 days before she was appointed, was originally from French Martinique. The Progress Party declared that they did not trust the new minister based on her involvement in the Directorate of Immigration ‘scandal’ that unravelled in 2006 (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg 2007</a></span>: 1058). At the time, Ms Ramin‐Osmundsen was the Head of the Directorate, but she chose to resign in May 2006. Government supporters argued that the criticism was related to colour, while the Progress Party argued that an ‘ethnic’ Norwegian with such a history would never have been appointed. The new Minister of Children and Equality also became responsible for anti‐discrimination affairs in the Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>On 20 February, parliament passed three comprehensive changes to the Constitution. The first was the repeal of the division of the Storting into two chambers (the Odelsting and the Lagting). The two chambers had different roles in the process of legislation for quality assurance and in order to secure thorough consideration for new proposals: a bill was introduced by the government in the form of a proposition to the Odelsting; if the Odelsting accepted or amended the recommendation, it then went to the Lagting in the form of an Odelsting resolution; the Odelsting resolution was debated in the Lagting and if approved there, was sent to the King in Council for signing into law. Under the new arrangement, new bills will need to be passed twice by the plenary Storting. A new bill is rejected if it does not pass the first vote. If the same bill is passed in two subsequent meetings, the motion is carried. If the new bill is not accepted in the second parliamentary meeting, it must be evaluated a third and final time. If the third vote is negative, the new bill proposal is rejected; if it passes the third time, it will become law upon royal assent. At least three days have to separate each vote. The new system will not come into operation until 1 October 2009.</p>
         
         <p>The other change related to a new procedure for impeachment. Under this, members of the Lagting will be replaced by an impeachment committee elected for a 6‐year period. The impeachment court now consists of eleven members: five Supreme Court judges and six elected MPs. The plenary Storting replaces the Odelsting as prosecuting authority. The changes were made in order to create a new and more efficient system that can hold ministers, MPs and court judges responsible for breaking the law. The new procedure came into operation immediately.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the third change was to enter parliamentarism into the Constitution. Previously, and since 1884, parliamentarism had only been an unwritten common law.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In January the Head of the Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions (LO), Gerd‐Liv Valla was accused of bullying by the LO International Secretary Ingunn Yssen. In a letter of resignation, published in Norway's largest newspaper <i>VG</i> (11 January 2007), she accused Valla of bullying by making it impossible for her to carry out her responsibilities, and for criticising her for becoming pregnant. This triggered a major scandal that dominated public debate for the first few months of 2007. Preventing harassment in the workplace is an important cause for the LO, which was about to start a new public campaign on this topic. Union members were divided over the conflict and the LO decided to appoint an outside committee to investigate the facts of the matter. The Labour Party, which has a close relationship with the organisation (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg &amp; Brekken 2006</a></span>: 1223) feared that the conflict would harm the party. Hence, Prime Minister Stoltenberg stressed that this was an internal staff conflict that had nothing to do with his party. It was decided that Ms Valla would no longer be in charge of Labour's nominating committee, thus breaking a long tradition of having the head of LO leading the party nomination process. Many political commentators and analysts have also suggested that Prime Minister Stoltenberg did not want to ‘help’ Ms Valla after their dispute over the IA agreement (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Tranøy 2007</a></span>; see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aalberg (2007</a></span>: 1060) for the IA agreement dispute).
         </p>
         
         <p>On 9 March the committee that was appointed to look into the allegations presented their report, which stated that Valla had violated the Working Environment Act in her dealings with Yssen. Gerd‐Liv Valla immediately announced that she was stepping down as head of LO. In the following weeks, the report and the investigation process was strongly criticised for concealment, inviting anonymous informers and for depriving Valla of the opportunity to appeal. Valla supporters argued that she was the victim of a conspiracy by the Labour Party and more conservative members of the LO. Others argued that Valla's handling of the conflict, as well as her controversial style of leadership, obliged her to resign. LO's deputy chairman Roar Flaathen became the new head when Valla resigned.</p>
         
         <p>While the first quarter of 2007 was totally dominated by the Valla dispute, the most important issues in the following six months were related to the local elections. After a winter with a lot of extreme weather, both the parties and the media stressed the importance of environment and climate chance. At the Labour Party's convention in April, the party declared itself Norway's leading environmental party. Prime Minister and party leader Jens Stotenberg declared that Norway will commit to reduce emissions of CO<sup>2</sup> by at least 30 per cent before 2020, and cut emissions by 100 per cent by 2050. Stoltenberg said that this should be done by purchasing carbon credits equal to the level of emissions. The party's new environmental profile was celebrated and praised by the convention's two guests of honour: former United Nations Secretary‐General Koffi Annan and former Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who also led the UN Commission that presented the so‐called ‘Brundtland Commission Report’ in 1987 on sustainable development and the environment. Labour previously had a reputation for prioritising industry and growth over environmental concerns.
         </p>
         
         <p>During the Spring conventions, most of the political parties, except the Progress Party, declared that the environment should be one of the most important issues during the upcoming election. Earlier polls had also suggested that the public thought that this was one of the most important issues, but as the election campaign started, new opinion polls suggested that other, more traditional issues were considered more important. According to polls published a few days before the election, voters thought that care for the elderly and education were the most important issues in the upcoming election. Environmental concerns were only listed as the fifth most important issue among the Norwegian electorate. For the media, a set of political scandals proved to be more important than political issues. One was related to Oslo's Mayor, Per Ditlev‐Simonsen (H), who had put away money in secret Swiss bank accounts in order to avoid tax. The Mayor declared that he did not want to resign as he was not up for re‐election. Party leader Erna Solberg, however, insisted that he go. After a public dispute among members of the Conservatives over the significance of the tax avoidance and the need for the Mayor to step down, Ditlev‐Simonsen decided to resign on 23 August.</p>
         
         <p>The Progress Party was also faced with a tax problem during the election campaign. In a report from the Oslo tax office it was claimed that the party had withheld 2.6 million Norwegian kroner. The money had been spent on travel for party members and their spouses. Party leader Siv Jensen did not want to publish the report despite a request from a united Storting. She argued that the report was not yet finished and thereby managed to limit the debate. However, in December, the Oslo tax office issued a formal notice that six key members of the Progress Party will be asked to pay the back taxes.</p>
         
         <p>During the election campaign there was also some turmoil around an informal meeting that took place between Stein Ørnhøi, a central adviser to Finance Minister Kristin Halvorsen (SV), and a lobbyist from the Swedish fighter plane producer JAS Gripen. Stoltenberg II and the Storting are preparing to buy new fighter planes, and it will be Norway's largest arms investment ever. Lobbying is not illegal in Norway, but Ørnhøi was heavily criticised by the media and the President of the Storting, Torbjørn Jagland, for assuring the Swedish lobbyist that he could change Norway's defence policy and make sure that Norway went for the Swedish producers and not the American company Lockheed Martin or the European Eurofighter consortium. The President of the Storting argued that Ørnhøi's actions seemed conspiratorial, while Ørnhøi himself declared that this was a conspiracy against him.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the issue that dominated the last part of the year was a finance scandal that occurred in eight municipalities after Terra Securities, a Norwegian finance broker, convinced the municipalities to invest future energy revenues in complicated funds provided by American City Bank. As the credit crisis emerged in the United States, the value of their investments dropped considerably. It became clear that the municipalities would lose much more than they had initially invested. Terra Securities was made bankrupt and it became clear that the municipalities had broken the Local Government Act. According to this Act, municipalities are only allowed to raise loans to invest in permanent property, buildings or equipment. The Minister of Local Government and Regional Development declared that the Government would not give the municipalities' financial aid. The municipalities also made unsuccessful appeals to the Norwegian Savings Bank, which had been the owner of Terra Securities.</p>
