         <p>The three major parties ended 2008 at roughly the same levels of support in the opinion polls as they had at the beginning. However, this masked considerable change in the relative fortunes of the Labour Government and the main opposition Conservative Party. The Conservatives started and ended the year with an average lead over Labour of six percentage points, but enjoyed record‐breaking leads of over twenty points during the summer. Their leader, David Cameron, enjoyed better personal approval ratings than either of the two previous Conservative opposition leaders since 1950 who subsequently won general elections (Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher) managed in their mid‐terms (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Curtice 2009</a></span>). The Liberal Democrats maintained fairly steady levels of support, but disappointingly for their new leader, Nick Clegg, they ended the year with an average of 15 per cent in the December polls, slightly down on the 17 per cent in January 2008, well below the party's 23 per cent at the last general election, and only a single percentage point above the 14 per cent average for the last month of Menzies Campbell's leadership.
         </p>
         
         <p>Political circumstances changed dramatically in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis and start of the recession. The reputation of the New Labour Government, and Gordon Brown especially, had been built on claims of prudent and moderate economic management, including independent monetary policy making, a new and light‐touch financial regulation system and self‐imposed public spending rules. The virtues of these policies were supposedly demonstrated by the long period of maintained economic growth, but this was dramatically undermined. In addition to (and partly because of) the banking crisis, over the course of 2008 there was a 28 per cent drop in the FTSE 100 share index, a 17 per cent drop in house prices, a drop in interest rates from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent (the lowest since 1951), as well as three successive quarters of negative growth. The cost of the nationalisation and recapitalisation of banks and a modest fiscal stimulus contributed to a rise of public sector net debt from 42 to 52 per cent of GDP, breaking Brown's 40 per cent rule. At the year end, the prospects for both the economy and public sector finances for 2009 looked worse still, changing the nature of the policy debate for all parties.</p>
         
         <p>For those inclined to think that public support for the government is driven by the economy, there is a puzzle. Labour support declined in the first half of the year, but when the financial crisis really took a major turn for the worse in September, the Government's poll ratings went up. This is perhaps especially bemusing given the financial regulation system that was found wanting was one that Labour had designed and implemented. While it is hard to imagine that the economic events played no role in explaining public opinion in 2008, it is easier to explain variation in polls with political events.</p>
         
         <p>The year to August saw a decline in Labour's support from 33 to 26 per cent. While there were rising food and fuel prices together with declining house prices in the first few months of 2008, there was also no shortage of negative political news for the Government that could account for Labour's declining poll support. Two episodes in particular are notable. First, after failing for several months to find a private sector buyer for Northern Rock (a bank that had to be rescued after a run in September 2007), the Government eventually chose nationalisation in February. This led to accusations of both dithering and a return to Labour's old socialist principles of public ownership.</p>
         
         <p>Second, after a so‐called ‘do nothing’ budget speech in March, the Government was threatened with a vote against the Finance Bill by sections of the parliamentary Labour Party critical of the failure to compensate those who would lose out from the abolition of the 10 per cent rate of income tax. This was a measure introduced in Gordon Brown's last budget as Chancellor in 2007, but not criticised at the time for fear of the implications for his transition to the leadership. Having lost support in the polls, some Labour backbenchers felt at liberty to make costly public demands in a way that damaged the credibility and authority of the Government. When the Chancellor, Alistair Darling, was forced to change policy at a cost of over £2 billion there appears to have been a step change down in the opinion polls. All but one of the seven polls before the announcement on 23 April put Labour above 30 per cent, but thereafter up to the middle of May all the polls had Labour below 30 per cent and averaging 26 per cent. Even though there was public sympathy for the low‐income earners who would have lost out from the abolition of the 10 per cent rate, having been forced to ‘correct a mistake’, the Government was portrayed as both weak and incompetent.</p>
         
         <p>The Government's woes were further compounded in late April with the first teachers' strike for 21 years, and its unpopularity seemed to be confirmed in the elections at the start of May. Labour's performance in the local elections was worse than in the 1980s and the Conservative, Boris Johnston, was elected as London Mayor. While Labour did gain a seat in the Greater London Assembly, their performance was little better than the very poor result in 2004, when the Iraq war was a more salient issue. The Government tried to shore up support by pushing for legislation allowing detention of suspected terrorists for up to 42 days without trial. Despite 36 Labour MPs voting against, a bill passed the Commons in June by virtue of support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). However, the bill was later to be defeated in the Lords and no effort has been made to revive it since. Also in June the Government proceeded with the unpopular ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, despite the Irish referendum vote against it.</p>
         
         <p>With poll ratings apparently stuck in the mid to high twenties, speculation about Gordon Brown's future became increasingly feverish, especially when Foreign Secretary David Miliband appeared to make a thinly veiled bid for the leadership by calling for Labour to make its case ‘afresh’. The debate and uncertainty persisted until September, when Gordon Brown's well‐received conference speech quipped that it was ‘no time for a novice’. The remark ostensibly referred to the Conservative leader, but it was understood to be a rebuke to the 43 year‐old David Miliband. Gordon Brown's successful reassertion of his leadership, perhaps in part due to the ability to point to decisive action on shortselling, seemed to result in a second step change in Labour's poll ratings. Whereas Labour averaged 26 per cent in the fifteen polls from 1 August to 18 September, they averaged 31 per cent in the polls after Brown's speech up to the middle of October.</p>
         
         <p>The recovery in Labour's ratings after the summer is commonly attributed to Gordon Brown's handling of the financial crisis – in particular the bailout of the banks that was praised and copied in other countries. For instance, Nobel prize‐winning economist Paul Krugman praised the clarity and decisiveness of the British Government plan, claiming that it had ‘defined the character of the worldwide rescue effort, with other wealthy nations playing catch‐up’. With a combination of capital injection and loan‐guarantee schemes, the Government may have helped avoid a much deeper recession. Whether in fact these actions were the reason for Labour's recovery in the polls is difficult to say, especially since the issues are complex and not widely understood even among the political elite. It may instead be that the public rallied round the Government at a time of emergency, in much the same way as they might in wartime. However, in the specific case of the step change in Labour support in mid‐September, it seems more likely that this was a conference boost rather than a response to the crisis.</p>
         
         <p>The third discernable change in the polls for Labour came, as with the April and September shifts, not with an economic event, but with Labour's unexpected victory in the Glenrothes by‐election. The cause of Scottish nationalism, and so the fortunes of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), who were expected to win Glenrothes, were dented by the particularly devastating effects of the financial crisis on Ireland and Iceland (two small countries that the SNP leader previously pointed to as model examples for an independent Scotland). However, this does not make the short‐term impact of the by‐election victory on the polls an economic rather than political effect. Moreover, the by‐election campaign focused on the SNP's record in power, both locally and as the Scottish executive, and saw close involvement by Gordon Brown (who is the MP for a neighbouring constituency) and especially his wife. This latter feature might help explain why the result was viewed partly as a personal victory for the Prime Minister, and so improved the party's ratings nationally.</p>
         
         <p>The remainder of the year saw continued anxiety about both the financial system and the economy more generally. The pre‐budget report in November included a limited fiscal stimulus in the form of a temporary cut in VAT (direct taxation on the consumption of goods and services), and the introduction of a 45 per cent income tax rate for earnings over £150,000. The implications for public‐sector borrowing led to criticism from opposition parties. While the Conservatives supported the bank bailout, they opposed the fiscal stimulus. David Cameron also took pains to criticise bankers. The Liberal Democrats argued that it would be better to spend money on environmental projects than cut VAT. In his first year as leader, Nick Clegg changed party policy from one advocating tax increases at the time of the last election to one promising both an overall reduction in taxation and more redistribution – although by the end of the year this policy was in danger of being overtaken by events.</p>
         
         <p>While much worse was to come in 2009, there were a series of scandals in 2008 concerning political donations and expenses. Peter Hain resigned from the Cabinet and Wendy Alexander resigned the leadership of the Scottish Labour Party, both after their (deputy) leadership campaigns breached regulations on donations. There was also an allegation that the Conservatives' Shadow Chancellor, George Osborne, tried to solicit an illegal donation from a Russian businessman, Oleg Deripaska. Tory MP Derek Conway was forced to leave the parliamentary party for using House of Commons money to pay his son a salary when there was little evidence of any work. Two Conservative Members of the European Parliament were forced to resign amid claims of expenses misuse, and the Conservative Party Chairman, Caroline Spelman, was accused of breaching regulations by having employed her nanny on her parliamentary staffing allowance.</p>
         
         <p>In May the High Court ruled that details of MPs second‐home expenses should be published, and this information caused public outrage when it was released in 2009 via a leak to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. The cost of the refurbishment of the home of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, and his pension also attracted public criticism and comments about his suitability to handle the expenses issue. The Speaker was also forced to apologise for his failure to challenge the police when, without a warrant, they searched the parliamentary office of Conservative MP Damian Green, who was arrested on suspicion of aiding a series of Home Office leaks.
         </p>
         
         <p>After restoration of devolved government in May 2007, the Northern Ireland Assembly passed its first budget in January. Disappointed by the resignation of his son and aide, the octogenarian Ian Paisley resigned as First Minister and was succeeded by his deputy Peter Robinson in May. The administration came close to collapse during a 152‐day deadlock, which was ended in November by a Sinn Féin and DUP agreed statement calling for responsibility for policing to be devolved without ‘undue delay’, but there was no timetable. Also in November, the Ulster Unionist and Conservative parties reached an agreement to nominate joint candidates in the European and general elections, bringing a return of mainstream British parties to Northern Ireland. The year also saw dissident republican car bomb, petrol bomb and gun attacks on the police.</p>
         
         <p>British involvement in military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan continued in 2008, but with increasing emphasis on the latter. In December there were twice as many British service men and women in Afghanistan than Iraq, and the government announced that troops would leave Iraq by July 2009.</p>

         <p>There were five by‐elections for the House of Commons in 2008. The Conservatives held two and gained one from Labour, while Labour held one and lost a further seat to the SNP. Bob Spink left the Conservatives to became the first ever Member of Parliament for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in April, but then asked to be redesignated as an independent in November. Changes to the composition of the House of Lords are summarised in Table 2.</p>
