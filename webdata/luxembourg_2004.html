         <p>Although the introduction of the principle of the referendum in the Constitution (Art. 51, § 7) dates back to 1919, only two referenda have been organized in the Grand Duchy since its independence. The questions posed were of crucial importance for its political regime, its economy and both its place and its image on the international scene. In 1919 Luxembourgers were asked whether they would prefer to remain a monarchy or become a republic(80 per cent chose the monarchy), under which Grand Duchess (Charlotte replaced Marie‐Adélaïde), and whether they would choose France or Belgium to form an economic union (73 per cent chose France, but eventually the UEBL, <i>Union économique belgo‐luxembourgeoise</i>, was formed in 1921 due to a deal between France and Belgium). In 1937 the government asked the population whether membership in revolutionary parties (including Nazi movements, but the Communist Party was seen as the real target of the centre‐right government) should be forbidden. Due to growing opposition led by trade unions against this project threatening freedom of opinion, the government was defeated (50.7 per cent rejected the proposition). Probably because of these results, no other referendum was held after this date.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the 1999 governmental declaration, and then in his 2003 State of the Nation speech, the Prime Minister proposed to legislate on the use of referenda. The original bill project stipulated the introduction of a right of popular initiative into the legislative system and the possibility of holding a referendum on legislative bills that were to be contested by a substantial part of the population, but as these initiatives would have necessitated constitutional reforms, the framework bill organizing referenda in general (which nevertheless specifically allows for the holding of referenda on constitutional amendments) was amended in 2004 (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; Poirier 2005a</a></span>). This framework bill received unanimous approval in parliament on 20 January. (The bill was promulgated on 4 February.) According to the Council of State, as the constitutional provision regarding the referendum is included in the section regarding the organization and the role of the Chamber of Deputies, rules pertaining to the organization of national elections should hold. Hence, European Union (EU) residents are not given the right to vote, but on the other hand, voting is compulsory for all nationals aged 18 and over. The bill does not organize any public financing for the two camps during a referendum campaign; neither does it envisage extra public money for political parties supporting one camp or the other.

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> The presidency of the EU Council and the referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe</h3>
            
            <p>Europe was clearly on Luxembourg's political agenda in 2005. In January, the Grand Duchy took over the presidency of the EU Council for the eleventh time since the founding treaties were signed. The general opinion in the ‘Eurocracy’ is that Luxembourg previously discharged this duty more than honourably in spite of the considerable challenge the Presidency represents in such a small country, especially with regard to human resources and the size of the governmental administration. Those successes were particularly evident in 1966 (the ‘Luxembourg Compromise’, in which Member States ‘agreed to disagree’ in order to protect national interests, aimed at reconciling France and the rest of the Six), 1985 (preparation of the Single European Act), 1991 (preparation of the Maastricht Treaty) and 1997 (implementation of a coordinated strategy for employment policy and agreement on a method and a procedure for the fifth enlargement of the EU).</p>
            
            <p>Prime Minister Jean‐Claude Juncker thus headed his second presidency after the experience of the second half of 1997, with the considerable advantage of having been a member of government for nearly 25 years and being the EU Council's living memory. Although most of his fellow Heads of State and Governments encouraged him to stand as Romano Prodi's successor as head of the Commission in 2004, he publicly and repeatedly declared during the national and European electoral campaign that he would stay as Luxembourg's prime minister. The 2004 elections reinforced tremendously his personal position at home, with a landslide victory of his party (CSV, Christian Socials) and a record high personal vote, and on the European scene as he became the first president of the ‘Eurogroup’. Moreover, as the DP (Liberals), who were part of the 1999–2004 coalition and thus had contributed to the drafting of the priorities of the government for the presidency, were no longer part of the new coalition (they were replaced by the LSAP, Socialists), the driving force of the presidency undoubtedly was Juncker.</p>
            
            <p>The first six months of 2005 were crucial for the process of ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and thus challenging for the presidency of the EU. After the signature of the Treaty by all 25 Member States' representatives in October 2004, the process of ratification started at the end of 2004 with the approval of the Constitution by Lithuania's and Hungary's parliaments, but it was in 2005, with the debates and the adoption of the Treaty by the European Parliament in January, and through the referenda to be held in Spain (February), France (May), the Netherlands (June) that the real tests were to come. Luxembourg, which had already decided in June 2003 (the coalition was still CSV‐DP) to hold a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty, confirmed this decision in the new government agreement (CSV‐LSAP) in the summer of 2004, and decided in November 2004 that the date of this referendum would be 10 July 2005, only a couple of weeks after the end of Luxembourg's presidency of the Council of the EU (see below). Hence, aside from the energies to be devoted to this presidency, the administration also had to inform its citizens and organize a referendum in the Grand Duchy for the first time in 68 years.</p>
            
            <p>Even though there were seven formal priorities for the EU presidency, four of them were given most attention: mid‐term review and re‐launching of the Lisbon strategy; examination of the Stability and Growth Pact; a political agreement on the financial perspectives of the Union (2007–2013); and the handling of Bulgarian, Romanian and Croatian membership candidatures.<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> Given the situation of the process of ratification of the EU Constitutional Treaty after the negative referenda in France and the Netherlands, the June Council was also marked by a declaration regarding this issue.
            </p>
            
            <p>Based on a disappointing mid‐term review of the efforts put forward by the Member States regarding the implementation of the Lisbon strategy (to build a performing European area of knowledge), and in order to ensure a more efficient governance of the process in the future, the March Council decided on the drawing up by each Member State of ‘national reform programmes’ geared to their own needs and specific situation (allowing for adaptations due to national policy cycles), after having consulted the relevant stakeholders at the national and regional levels. This was seen as a push towards the application of the Luxembourg model at the European level.<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a> Criticism stemming from the Socialists, Greens and the leftist groups in the European Parliament accused the ‘business friendly’ Commission of selling out Lisbon to a ‘neo‐liberal’ growth‐only agenda, and thus leaving out the social and environmental priorities of the strategy. Others feared that the Commission would not be in a position to force governments to draft ambitious national action plans and even less to monitor the implementation of these plans. Overall, the decisions arrived at in Luxembourg were, given the current situation of weak commitments between Member States, accepted more generally as a pragmatic step in the re‐launching of the strategy without undermining its ambitious objectives.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Stability and Growth Pact has been progressively devalued over the past few years by the persistent failure of the two leading members of the Eurozone – France and Germany – to adhere to its requirements. In this context, for the majority of European policy analysts, Jean‐Claude Juncker was regarded as the ‘right man’ to oversee the reform process, not the least because his longevity and multiple hats (President of the Council, President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister, Minister of Finance) allowed him more than anyone else to see the linkages between the Lisbon debate, the financial perspectives of the EU, the reform of the Pact and the potential for using one set of negotiations to facilitate the other. Although he would be keen to defend the interests of Luxembourg's powerful neighbours who regard him very highly, he was not expected to give up on the principles of a pact to which he had personally contributed.</p>
            
            <p>Before the March European Summit, Juncker indeed insisted on the necessity of finding an agreement acceptable not only for France and Germany, but also for countries demanding strict implementation of the criteria and sanctions, like Austria and Netherlands. Overall, the Pact was not weakened or loosened, as the two nominal anchors – the 3 per cent of GDP reference value for deficits and the 60 per cent of GDP reference value for debt – continue to be the centrepieces of multilateral surveillance. Whenever they are breached, a Member State will come under enhanced surveillance by its peers through a Commission report and assessment by the Council in order to ensure that gross policy errors, as opposed to economic ‘bad luck’, are identified. No expenditure will be excluded from the 3 per cent limit. Peer support and peer pressure were thus recognized as integral parts of a reformed Stability and Growth Pact. However, the Commission's report will have to take a number of medium‐term economic and budgetary developments (potential growth, the implementation of policies in the context of the Lisbon agenda and policies to foster research and development and innovation, fiscal consolidation efforts in ‘good times’, and so on) into account, as well as factors considered relevant by the Member State concerned, to comprehensively assess in qualitative terms the recorded excesses of the reference value (e.g., budgetary contributions aimed at fostering international solidarity or achieving European policy goals that may have a detrimental effect on the growth and fiscal burden of a Member State). Each country's specifics will thus be assessed and the time required for a return to a sustainable position if it follows the recommendations by taking effective action will be given. However, a country in excessive deficit will be required to achieve an annual minimum fiscal effort. This agreement can be considered the main positive point of Luxembourg's presidency.</p>
            
            <p>A negative point attributable to the presidency was its will to move forward at all costs with the enlargement to include countries like Croatia. Whereas, following the Commission's positive judgment in February on the scheduled April 2005 signing of Romania's and Bulgaria's Accession Treaties, these were in effect signed (even though the Commission would keep a watchful eye on how Bulgaria and, particularly, Romania carry out their promised reforms, notably putting into practice a ‘monitoring system’ to oversee the fight against corruption and organized crime), Jean‐Claude Juncker's promise to start accession negotiations with Croatia during Luxembourg's presidency was not upheld. Doubts emanated from several capitals and the EPP (the party to which Juncker belongs), and were fuelled by the argument of Carla del Ponte, chief United Nations war crimes prosecutor, who complained about the lack of cooperation of the Croatian government in locating, arresting and handing over war crime fugitive Ante Gotovina. As the EU held out the promise of membership to all countries of the Balkans on condition that they respect the 1995 Dayton peace agreements, which among other things prescribe full cooperation with the UN war crimes tribunal, Member States for the first time at a European Summit decided to put off a previously set date for accession talks with a candidate state, citing a human rights issue as the reason for this delay and giving no new date for the start of talks. Following the visit of an EU monitoring team and a letter from Chief Prosecutor of The Hague's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) evaluating the situation, the June Council said that so long as concrete results were seen rapidly, decisions on the accession process would be taken under the British presidency. Jean‐Claude Juncker was thus overruled and probably regretted afterwards having moved too rapidly as a representative of a small Member State defending another future small Member State.</p>
            
            <p>Luxembourg's presidential six months ended with two dramas for which its representatives cannot be blamed. First, despite his endless efforts, Juncker did not manage to reach a consensus on the financial perspectives of the EU. There was an open clash between net contributor countries and those that benefit from European subsidies. Already at the end of 2003, six leaders of those Member States that are the biggest net contributors stated that the EU's budget should be capped at 1 per cent of its gross national income (GNI). The Commission rejected the idea, arguing that the EU's goals in the areas of justice and home affairs, external affairs and the Lisbon agenda would be impossible to achieve with such a reduced budget, and called for an average spending level of 1.14 per cent of GNI over the next seven‐year period. Next to the concerns of the principal net contributors, the principal beneficiaries of the budget wanted to retain their benefits and those who were new to the game wanted to be treated as well as, if not better than, the current beneficiaries. The struggle over the financial perspectives for 2007–2013 was thus unlike anything that has come before, as it involved many more players and many more special interests. Moreover, as it took place against the background of a prolonged economic downturn in the Eurozone in general, and Germany in particular, the simple solution of the old days whenever problems pertaining to the financial package appeared, which was to let Germany pay, was no longer available.</p>
            
            <p>In the end, two main factors explained the failure of the negotiations. The first was that the completion of the budgetary negotiations coincided with the referenda on the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, one of the themes of the ‘No’ campaign was that the country contributed too much to the EU; the Dutch referendum gave the government representatives an ever firmer mandate to cut this financial burden. The second and most important factor was the British rebate obtained by Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s. Tony Blair, facing one of the most eurosceptic electorates in the EU, did not want to surrender to Brussels and made an explicit link between maintaining the British rebate or reforming the funding of the EU's common agriculture policy (CAP), arguing that only about 5 per cent of European citizens were the beneficiaries of around 40 per cent of the EU budget (the proportion devoted to the CAP). Arguing in a nutshell that CAP was the past and that funding innovation, research and jobs policy was more important, this position clashed with the French standpoint. The French government, already beaten by its own electorate on the issue of the Constitutional Treaty, would not give in and accept the reform of CAP alone. The Presidency of the Council made a number of proposals, such as linking cuts in the contributions of the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden and the amount of the British rebate, or in a final version keeping the latter roughly as it was but forcing the United Kingdom to contribute to cohesion funds in the 10 new countries (CAP excepted), but these suggestions, together with a proposal of a declaration calling for a reform of all aspects of the budget, with possible adjustments of the 2007–2013 financial perspectives in 2009, were all refused. At the end of the negotiations the new, poorer countries even proposed reducing the funds they were guaranteed to receive in order to finally come to an agreement, but the June European Council ended with no consensus on the financial perspectives. Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean‐Claude Juncker, deeply hurt by this lack of agreement, declared that his faith in Europe had taken a serious beating.</p>
            
            <p>Second, the European Council meeting of 16–17 June was marked by the official declaration of the Heads of State and Governments on the ‘reflection pause’ of the process of ratification of the Constitutional Treaty. The deadline of November 2006 was postponed (the Austrian presidency would examine the state of the process by mid‐2007) and Member States were awarded more time for reflection, explanation and debate before launching their ratification processes. The Council thus decided that the process of ratification should continue, that the Treaty was not re‐negotiable and that instead of a plan B for the Constitutional Treaty, the Commission would propose a plan D of dialogue and debate.</p>
            
            <p>As President of the EU Council, Jean‐Claude Juncker invited Luxembourg's parliament to accept this decision, without explicitly suggesting that the Luxembourg referendum be postponed. The referendum (the first referendum in 68 years) on the Constitutional Treaty was to be held on 10 July, less than one month after the European Council and only 10 days after the formal end of Luxembourg's Presidency. The conference of parliamentary groups' chairs of the Chamber of Deputies, however, decided to let the process continue as planned and confirmed that the referendum would be held on 10 July, despite the fact that unpublished polls suggested that the ‘No’ campaign had gained ground (see <a href="#f1" class="scrollableLink">Figure 1</a>, indicating that the level of the ‘Yes’ vote had already fallen below 50 per cent in May, but the gap between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ became very small just after the European Council).

                  </figcaption></figure></section><p>On 28 June, the Chamber of Deputies took its first vote approving the Treaty (55 MPs voted in favour, the sovereignists of the ADR were absent). As the Constitution specifies that international treaties are to be ratified by parliament, it was decided by the government and parliament that the Constitutional Treaty would be voted on first by parliament, then the referendum would be held and finally there would be a second vote by parliament (under Luxembourg's legislative system, all bills have to be voted on twice, with a time gap of at least three months between the two votes) taking the results of the referendum into account. On 8 June, a resolution was adopted by parliament stating that MPs would respect the result of the referendum and act accordingly in the second vote, ensuring that, despite its consultative character, the referendum would constrain Luxembourg representatives to reject the ratification of the Treaty in case of a majority for the ‘No’ camp.</p>
            
            <p>The personalization of the campaign was to be expected, as Prime Minister Juncker, already in November 2004 and repeatedly after the French and the Dutch ‘No’ votes, announced that he would resign if the result of the referendum in Luxembourg were negative. This threat was taken seriously by the population, although it may also have played a counter‐productive role for the ‘Yes’ camp. Having completed his EU duties, he entered the campaign arena energetically in the last days of June (after having been omnipresent in the press in the first half of 2005 as President of the Council, he participated in more than 60 public meetings and debates), and as in 2004 for the national and EU elections his party concentrated on this ‘Juncker on Tour’ strategy.</p>
            
            <p>The personal involvement of the Prime Minister, who had received a record high level of preferential votes in 2004, probably had an effect on the result of the referendum, as the level of the ‘No’ response to the Constitutional Treaty, especially after the French and Dutch ‘No’ decision, reached a level unexpected for the Grand Duchy. Although Luxembourg ranked first in Spring 2005 in terms of favorable opinions towards the EU, with 80 per cent of inhabitants having a positive opinion on the country's EU membership (EU average: 54 per cent),<a href="#en3" class="scrollableLink"><sup>3</sup></a> mainly because of the recognition that it benefits from this membership (72 percent, EU average: 55 per cent), resentment against European integration and fears about its future had grown in recent times. Despite the highest GDP per capita and a low level of unemployment (slightly above 4 per cent), the economic situation was perceived as bad by many Luxembourgers as this rate of unemployment literally doubled in the last four years.<a href="#en4" class="scrollableLink"><sup>4</sup></a> Due to threats of delocalization of large companies, fears of employment losses in the powerful banking sector or in the civil service sector in the event of tax harmonization or decisions regarding the opening of all public sector jobs to non‐nationals made at the European level, Luxembourgers came to be among the most pessimistic about the evolution of unemployment (55 per cent, EU average: 42 per cent in Spring 2005). They somehow made the link between this perceived bad economic situation and the EU explicit, as 23 per cent declared that the EU meant ‘unemployment’ (EU average: 19 per cent).<a href="#en5" class="scrollableLink"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
            
            <p>In recent years, Luxembourg's population has also become more concerned about the arrival of refugees (starting in the 1990s with the Balkan crisis) and illegal immigration, and a correlation was made in the minds of many inhabitants between these phenomena and increased criminality, with the EU as the ultimate authority responsible for these problems. The 2004 enlargement of the EU to include ten new countries and the prospect of future enlargements were largely rejected by the population: 60 per cent were against future enlargements (EU average: 38 per cent) and 78 per cent rejected the membership of Turkey in particular (EU average: 65 per cent), which placed Luxembourg among the top four countries opposing further enlargements (alongside France, Germany and Austria). Luxembourg's generous social security system, potentially threatened by convergence policies dictated by the EU, or the question of the loss of national sovereignty and identity (the issue of the national language) with regard to European citizenship and rights for non‐nationals in a country where about one out of three Luxembourg residents come from another EU Member State, were other concerns of Luxembourgers with regard to further European integration steps and thus the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
            
            <p>Increasing Eurosceptic sentiments in the population were not channeled through party competition as there is no real cleavage on European issues in Luxembourg: all parties currently represented in the Chamber of Deputies ratified the previous EU treaties and during the 2004 European election campaign, even the most sovereignist party represented in parliament – the Action Committee for Democracy and Pensions Justice (ADR) – supported the Constitutional Treaty project. It was only in April 2005 that a party congress overruled the position of the leaders and the ADR actively campaigned against the adoption of the Treaty (it campaigned against the application of Turkey to the EU, the loss of national sovereignty, the dangers for national culture and identity, among other things). Overall, the proportion of MPs belonging to parties that campaigned against the adoption of the Treaty in 2005 was only 8.3 per cent. If one also counts parties that did not have representation in parliament, the proportion of votes received in 2004 by parties that were opposed to the EU Treaty (radical left parties) was roughly 12 per cent (13 per cent at the national elections and 11 per cent at EU elections). However, as national and EU elections are held simultaneously, and party heavyweights fight in both elections before resigning from their EU mandate, European Parliament elections were never fought on European issues and thus never served as a barometer indicating satisfaction or dissatisfaction on EU integration and EU policies. Thus in 2005, Luxembourg citizens were able to express their opinion on these issues for the first time since the creation of the ECSC.</p>
            
            <p>As early as July 2004, a ‘Committee for the No’ was formed in Luxembourg. It was mainly led by members of the radical left parties, with the former MP of <i>Déi Lénk</i> (The Left) André Hoffmann as the main figure, ATTAC Luxembourg, the <i>Friends of Le Monde diplomatique</i>, the <i>Friddensinitiativ </i>(a nongovernmental organization dedicated to peace, a movement boosted by the demonstration of 40,000 participants against war in Iraq in February 2003) and the socialist student trade union UNEL. This Committee mainly criticized the lack of improvement towards a social Europe, fought against the ‘constitutionalization of neo‐liberalism as the official European doctrine and the institutionalization of the relationship between the EU and the NATO’, the potential dismantlement of the public sector, the militarization of Europe, and so on. The Committee invited famous opponents to the Treaty (e.g., José Bové and Henri Emmanuelli of France) to present their case, but probably relied too much on leftist arguments developed abroad against the Treaty without taking the specific economic and social situation of the Grand Duchy into account. Other leftist parties such as the LSAP (in government) or the Greens campaigned in favour of the adoption of the Treaty. The OGB‐L (socialist trade union) officially supported the Constitutional Treaty, but without involving the organization in the campaign for the ‘Yes’. Some individual figures, like the Green MP Jean Huss or the president of the public transportation socialist trade union Nico Wennmacher, however, took the liberty of campaigning in the ‘No’ camp.
            </p>
            
            <p>Although the arguments of the ‘Yes’ camp varied from insistence on how European Integration contributed to peace to the need to improve the functioning of EU institutions, observers could not avoid noticing that at the end of the campaign quite nationalistic and cynical stances were taken to justify a ‘Yes’ vote. To the leftist critiques on the Treaty regarding its feebleness on social and fiscal harmonization, CSV representatives, including the Prime Minister, replied that this weakness was good for Luxembourgers as it assured that the generous national social security system would not be endangered and that the financial sector, the main engine of the Grand Duchy's economy, would keep its competitiveness. The fact that measures aiming at preventing further delocalization of companies, in a broad context of globalization, were not present in the text was also seen as unproblematic because Luxembourg's economy largely had benefited from these delocalizations in the last decades. Following Jean‐Claude Juncker's formula in his speech to the Chamber of Deputies in late June, the main slogan of the CSV was ‘the European Constitution: Good for Europe, good for Luxembourg’, dubbing the instrumental Europhile opinion of Luxembourgers (the country benefits from its membership) well‐documented by <i>Eurobarometers</i>. Finally, in the ‘Yes’ camp in general, voting ‘No’ was presented by some as a potential danger with regard to Luxembourg's hosting of several EU institutions, which also clearly contributed to the country's wealth since the 1960s, and as a potential weakening of the position of the Grand Duchy in the EU in general.
            </p>
            
            <p>As voting was compulsory, about 90.5 per cent of the 220,717 people registered did vote. Participation was thus slightly lower than for the 2004 national elections (91.92 per cent), but the blank and invalid votes were much less numerous (5.59 per cent of the recorded votes in 2004). The overall result of the referendum was 56.52 per cent in favour of the text. A majority of ‘No’ was recorded in only nine of the 118 communes; seven of these are highly populated (six of them in the top ten in terms of the size of the population) located in the southern part of the country along the French border. This is the old coal mining and heavy industry region of Luxembourg, where leftist parties still have their core electorate.<a href="#en6" class="scrollableLink"><sup>6</sup></a> Two other, much smaller, communes voted against the Treaty, and both of these communes host a refugee centre. Altogether, these nine communes represent 7.6 per cent of the communes in the Grand Duchy, but more than 20 per cent of the population. On the other hand, the highest score for the ‘Yes’ camp (68.31 per cent) was recorded in Strassen: one of the numerous wealthy suburban communes around Luxembourg City.
            </p>
            
            <p>The correlations between the level of the ‘Yes’ vote and the results of the 2004 national and European elections, using the commune as the unit of analysis, show that the former is positively linked to the results of the Democratic Party (Liberals), the Greens and the Christian‐Socials. On the other hand, the level of the ‘Yes’ vote is negatively correlated with the results of the Communists, the Socialists, the Left and the sovereignist ADR, thereby showing that the ‘No’ vote was mainly a leftist ‘No’, with a touch of nationalist populism. With regard to the socio‐demographic composition of communes, the ‘No’ vote increased with the proportion of blue‐collar workers in the active population, the proportion of less educated inhabitants, the rate of unemployment and more generally the evolution of the size of population in the commune in the last ten years (the higher the increase in population, the higher the level of the ‘No’ vote). On the contrary, the ‘Yes’ vote was positively related to the proportions of highly educated inhabitants, independents,<a href="#en7" class="scrollableLink"><sup>7</sup></a> civil servants and rental prices. The post‐electoral Flash <i>Eurobarometer</i> survey largely confirmed this analysis, but revealed that respondents who felt close to Socialist Party (LSAP) and the Greens were equally split between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. Most of the voters who made up their minds a long time before the referendum voted in favour of its adoption, but most of those who were still hesitant some weeks before opted for ‘No’. The campaign, during which the French and the Dutch ‘No’ votes occurred, thus had an impact on the level of the ‘No’ vote in Luxembourg.

            <p>It is interesting to observe how national concerns motivated both the ‘Yes’ and the ‘No’ camps: 37 per cent of the ‘No’ voters argued that the Constitutional Treaty would have negative effects on employment in Luxembourg (fears of companies leaving the country and of the Bolkestein directive) and 23 per cent declared that Luxembourg's current bad economic situation and its rate of unemployment prevented them from supporting the Treaty, 9 per cent saw a loss of sovereignty, some 7 per cent voted ‘No’ to oppose the government (or some parties) and 5 per cent to force Juncker to resign. In the ‘Yes’ camp, 23 per cent argued that the Treaty would reinforce Luxembourg in the EU and on the international scene, 16 per cent felt it would reinforce the socio‐economic situation in the country, 9 per cent declared that they wanted to avoid Juncker's resignation and another 8 per cent wanted to support the government (or certain parties). On the one hand, a latent social malaise expressed itself and, on the other, the last weeks of the campaign of the ‘Yes’ camp had an economic nationalist tune, with the CSV in particular insisting that the social and fiscal advantages of Luxembourg were not threatened by the Constitutional Treaty and that in any case what was good for Europe was good for Luxembourg.</p>
            
            <p>The leftist ‘No’ camp argued that the Treaty did not pave the way for a Social Europe (22 per cent) and that it favoured a liberal view of economics (11 per cent), but among the motivations of ‘No’ voters, one can clearly see that many Luxembourgers felt that EU integration had gone too far (20 per cent), Turkey should not be part of the EU (17 per cent) and there should be no more enlargements (13 per cent). Although numerous advocates of the ‘No’ camp declared that they wanted ‘more’ Europe,<a href="#en8" class="scrollableLink"><sup>8</sup></a> the survey shows that ‘No’ voters did not support the Treaty mostly because of a nationalist withdrawal in a climate of economic insecurity, coupled with a quite peculiar composition of working force. In the ‘Yes’ camp, the instrumental role of the Constitution for ‘more’ Europe was put forward, together with the fact that the Treaty symbolizes the positive aspects of EU integration. ‘Yes’ voters pointed first at its role for furthering EU integration (39 per cent), peace (28 per cent), future generations (18 per cent) and a good functioning of EU institutions (14 per cent). They also saw the Treaty as a first step for a Social Europe, a political union and a real EU citizenship (respectively, 16, 13 and 11 per cent), a reinforcement of EU identity and democracy (respectively, 14 and 11 per cent). These positive arguments with regard to EU integration were also largely presented in the official campaign.
            </p>
            
            <p>Unlike in France (47 per cent) and the Netherlands (28 per cent), the key element determining the ‘No’ vote was not the voters' opinion about the socio‐economic situation of the country, but rather their opinion on the European Constitutional Treaty itself (35 per cent). In Luxembourg, the country's situation came second in the motivations of the ‘No’ voters with 30 per cent (21 per cent in the ‘Yes’ camp). Only 13 per cent of the ‘Yes’ voters mentioned their opinion on the Treaty as the element determining their vote. There were, on the other hand, 49 per cent of ‘Yes’ voters arguing that they above all voted according to their opinion on the EU in general (this was also the most popular item among ‘Yes’ voters in France and the Netherlands).</p>
            
            <p>On 25 October, the Chamber of Deputies confirmed its first vote on the adoption of the Treaty and in accordance with the result of the referendum, this vote was almost unanimous (57 MPs voted in favour, one MP from the ADR voted against and two MPs were absent).</p>

            <p>In January, Luxembourg mourned Grand Duchess Joséphine‐Charlotte, wife of former Grand Duke Jean and mother of current Grand Duke Henri. In February, the European Court of Justice ruled that Luxembourg had breached EU law by failing to transpose fully European Directives 2000/43/CE (implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin), 2002/73/CE and 2004/113/CE (non‐discrimination and equal opportunities for all). The deadline for EU Member States to transpose these Directives was July 2003. Luxembourg soon adopted them and created a High Committee against all forms of discrimination.</p>
            
            <p>In Autumn 2005, the results of the Luxembourg local elections showed the LSAP made significant progress (from 143 to 170 councilors), gaining control of new councils in the centre of the country, in electoral areas that are not usually considered favourable for the Socialists (suburban middle class and well‐educated population, working in the services, and former rural areas). The performance of the party was unexpected for two reasons. First, at the previous local elections in 1999, the LSAP became the first party in terms of number of councilors. Leaders of the party and columnists felt that it was almost impossible to gain additional seats, especially since at the last general elections in 2004 the party only gained 1 per cent (from 22.3 to 23.3 per cent) although it had been in the opposition for five years. Second, it had been the junior party of the governmental coalition since 2004, and its direction was shaken by the split electorate of the party on the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty (see above). Some political commentators and members of the parliamentary group predicted some losses in the south of the country, the historical area for the steel industry, arguing that the mobilization of its traditional electorates would be weak, but these losses failed to materialize.</p>
            
            <p>The CSV gained 24 councilors (from 126 to 150) and took control of councils across Luxembourg, especially in the east, new urban areas. The Christian Democrats, however, failed to make hoped‐for gains in Luxembourg City. The Democratic Party (the Liberals), already sanctioned at the general elections, suffered losses of both councils and councilors (from 106 to 101), particularly in the electoral district of the Centre, its traditional bastion, but kept control of the capital city. The Greens almost doubled their councilors (from 24 to 40), principally in the electoral districts of the Centre and the East; meanwhile, the ADR and the radical left (the ‘Left’ and the Communist Party of Luxembourg) continued their decline (respectively, from 11 to 5 councilors and from 6 to 1). The most significant and surprising results were in Luxembourg City, where for the first time the Liberals and the Greens formed a coalition together (which is now completely distinct from the composition of the coalition at the national level); the CSV was thus left in the opposition for the first time in 36 years (it had constantly been in coalition with the Liberals) although it remained the second largest party in the capital in terms of votes.</p>
            
            <p>In November, Luxembourg's traditionally quiet political life was perturbed by press revelations concerning the terrorist acts that had taken place at the beginning of the 1980s: ‘the Bommeleeër affair’. In 1985, a series of minor terrorist attacks took place in the Grand Duchy, including one near the international airport where an electricity pylon was destroyed by a rudimentary bomb. The diverse investigations directed by the police, justice and the government were never closed as the authors of these minor destructions were never found. A few hypotheses were advanced by the authorities and the press to explain this series of terrorist acts: a ‘vendetta’ between a young member of the Grand Duke's family and Luxembourg's government; the competition between different Western secret services related to the ‘Gladio scandal’; the temptation to intimidate the Luxembourg state by some European radical leftist group such as ‘Action directe’ or ‘Rote Armee Fraktion’. In 2005, not only did the main television channel RTL claim to have found a crucial witness of this terrorist act, but this witness claimed that he had been pressured not to reveal the name of the person he said he had seen near the location of the bombing, thereby giving the ‘affair’ a touch of suspense and potential scandal. In a second interview with RTL, the alleged witness declared he would only reveal the name of the person he had recognized to the Prime Minister himself, arguing he was the only person he trusted. Prime Minister Juncker agreed to meet the witness, and the latter told him he had seen Prince Jean of Luxembourg, the son of Grand‐Duke Jean, near the blown‐up pylon on the day of the bombing some twenty years before. In December 2005, DNA evidence proved that Prince Jean of Luxembourg was not involved in the bombing. All parties, except the CSV, strongly criticized the fact that the Prime Minister bypassed the usual procedures of justice, and that he had a very personal conception of the exercise of power and democracy.</p>
