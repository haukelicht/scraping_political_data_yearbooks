         <p>The composition of the Swiss cabinet (Federal Council) is determined both by formal factors, such as the number of cabinet members, and by informal arrangements, such as the quota of cabinet seats allocated to each party and the regional and linguistic origin of the cabinet members. Formerly know as the ‘magic formula’, the distribution of seats among the major parties within the oversized coalition government changed in 2003 (for the first time since 1959) when the SVP/UDC (Swiss People's Party) was allocated a second seat to the detriment of the CVP/PDC (Christian Democrats), which retained a single seat. In 2008, the number of parties represented in the Federal Council changed from four to five when Federal Council member Eveline Widmer Schlumpf was expelled from the SVP and joined the newly formed BDP/PBD (Conservative Democratic Party<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a>) (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic 2009</a></span>: 1124).
         </p>
         
         <p>In this context, in which some of the traditional consociational elements of the Swiss executive have shifted, Federal Council elections by the United Federal Assembly have become more contentious and more heatedly debated in public and in the media. In June 2009, Federal Council member Pascal Couchepin of the FDP/PLR (Liberal Democrats) announced his intention to resign from the cabinet effective from 31 October. The announcement by the Minister of the Interior from the French‐speaking part of the canton of Valais soon led to an intense debate surrounding the election of his successor by the Federal Assembly. In keeping with the traditional composition of the Federal Council, its next member should also come from the Latin part of Switzerland. Immediately, several possible candidates started to appear in the centre of the media debate that ensued over their cultural and regional background. The debate was further fuelled by the CVP/PDC's announcement that it would contest the FDP/PLR's right to replace their departing cabinet member. In the weeks running up to the election (set for September 16), the CVP/PDC's candidate Urs Schwaller from the bilingual canton of Fribourg appeared as a serious contender against the FDP/PLR's two candidates, Didier Burkhalter and Christian Lüscher.</p>
         
         <p>A win by the CVP of the vote in the Federal Assembly would have re‐established the seat the party had lost to the SVP/UDC's ‘rogue’ candidacy of Christoph Blocher in 2003 (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hardmeier 2004</a></span>: 1151–1154). However, on the day of the election, the FDP/PLR's Didier Burkhalter won the seat after three rounds of voting and was elected by the United Federal Assembly as the new member of the Federal Council and head of the Federal Department of Home Affairs. Doris Leuthard (CVP/PDC) was elected President of the Swiss Federation for 2010 by the United Federal Assembly.

         <p>The year 2009 was not a parliamentary election year. The incumbent Federal Assembly, composed of the National Council (lower house) and the Council of States (upper house), was elected in 2007. The next parliamentary election will take place in 2011.</p>
         
         <p>The party composition of both houses remained unchanged in 2009. Some mutations took place during 2009 due to resignations or deaths. Ernst Leuenberger, member of the Council of States for the SPS/PSS (Social Democrats) died while in office on 6 June. His seat remained vacant until 1 March 2010, when fellow SPS/PSS National Council member Roberto Zanetti was elected as replacement. Gisèle Ory of the SPS/PSS resigned her seat in the Council of States and was replaced by Didier Berberat. One SVP/UDC seat in the National Council that had remained vacant after Ueli Maurer's election to the Federal Council in 2008 was filled in 2009 by Ulrich Schlüer.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Results of national referenda and initiatives</h2>
         
         <p>The Swiss electorate was called to vote for national referenda and initiatives on four occasions during the year 2009. In the first ballot of 2009 (on 8 February), voters were asked to decide on a federal decree approving the continuation of the agreement on free movement of persons between Switzerland and the European Union (EU). The continuation was coupled to the extension of the agreement to the new EU members Bulgaria and Romania. Smaller parties on the right, as well as the youth chapter of the SVP/UDC, opposed the proposal and called for a referendum against it. The territorial extension of the agreement to new EU member countries was the most contested element of the ballot and dominated the debate during the campaign period leading up to the vote. As is usually the case with ballots regarding European integration, the Swiss electorate considered the vote to be of high importance and, accordingly, the turnout of 51 per cent was above average. The argument of the government and a majority of Parliament in favour of the proposal was that a refusal would seriously hinder continuation of bilateral negotiations between Switzerland and the EU. A rather thin majority of the voters agreed with that position, and the proposal was accepted with 59.6 per cent of the vote.</p>
         
         <p>On 17 May, the Swiss electorate was asked to decide on two proposals. The first was a constitutional amendment regarding the status of alternative or complementary medicine. As the proposal required changing the Swiss Constitution, it was automatically subject to a compulsory referendum, requiring both a popular majority as well as a majority of the cantons. The proposal's supporters wanted compulsory health insurance to include coverage of alternative therapies such as homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, herbal medicine and similar treatments. Government, Parliament and all major parties except the SVP/UDC were in favour of the proposal. Opponents argued that there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness and cost‐efficiency of alternative treatments. The voters, however, approved the proposal with a clear majority of 67.0 per cent. All cantons approved the proposal as well.</p>
         
         <p>The second proposal on the May ballot was more contested and regarded the introduction of Swiss passports and foreign travel documents containing biometric data. The Government, Parliament and the parties of the centre supported the proposal, while both the centre‐left SPS/PSS and the SVP/UDC on the right opposed it. With the SPS/PSS and SVP/UDC being the two parties with the largest electorate, a very tight result was expected. While arguments in favour ranged from freedom to travel to reducing risks of abuse and falsification, the bulk of the opposition to the proposal was mainly focused on data protection (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Lloren &amp; Nai 2009</a></span>: 5). Indeed, the proposal was approved by the slightest majority of the electorate (50.1 per cent). Given the close result, Parliament decided to take into account some of the arguments of the defeated opponents. A parliamentary commission was charged with reviewing some of the more contested aspects of the law. Most controversy had arisen over the planned central database in which all biometric data would be stored and the introduction of biometric identity cards in addition to passports. The commission in the National Council approved a parliamentary initiative to maintain identity cards without biometric data and to make the storage of data in a central database voluntary, not compulsory. A commission of the Council of States, however, did not give the required support to the parliamentary initiative and sent the proposal back to the lower house in early 2010. At the time of writing, the second debate is pending.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ballot of 27 September contained two items upon which the electorate had to decide. The first was a federal government decision regarding the auxiliary financing of disability insurance through a temporary increase of VAT (Value Added Tax) rates. The Disability Insurance Fund was in debt and was being cross‐financed through funds from the Old Age and Survivors Insurance, which was being put under severe financial pressure. A new model for separating both institutions and safeguarding their financial sustainability was needed. The SVP/UDC opposed the proposal, arguing that what was required was stricter enforcement against abuse of disability insurance and not a new financing model and increased taxation. Several cases of disability insurance fraud were publicised during the campaign with the aim of mobilising disconcerted voters. Despite this campaign and the rise in indirect taxes, the proposal was accepted with a majority of 54.6 per cent of the vote. The Disability Insurance Fund was regarded by the voters as a social security institution worth saving (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Kuster et al. 2009</a></span>: 17). The required majority of the cantons was also met – albeit by a close margin of 12 cantons in favour and 11 against.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second item on the September ballot was a federal government decision that proposed to waive the introduction of the general initiative created through popular vote in 2003 but generally regarded as inapplicable. The proposal was completely uncontested and practically no campaigning for or against it took place. Without other significant elite signals, the electorate followed the recommendations of the federal government and Parliament and accepted the waiver of the introduction of the initiative by 67.9 per cent of the vote and a totality of the 23 cantons.</p>
         
         <p>On 29 November, the Swiss electorate went to the polls for a fourth and final time in 2009. Three decisions were required from them. The first item gained international notoriety through extensive media coverage. A popular initiative had been launched to ban the construction of new minarets in Switzerland. The arguments on the proponents' side were that minarets, as architectural structures, have no religious significance and hence a ban would not contravene the freedom of religion granted by the Swiss Constitution. Instead, they should be regarded as symbolic of a political claim to power that contradicts the Constitution. The government, Parliament and all the major parties except the SVP/UDC opposed the initiative. The argument of the opposing camp was that the initiative stood in contradiction to many principles anchored in Swiss tradition and enshrined in the Constitution, such as the principles of equality under the law, freedom of religion, ownership guarantee and the principle of proportionality as well as international law. Additionally, a federal ban on the construction of minarets would represent a transgression of cantonal jurisdictions over building and planning laws. However, a majority of 57.5 per cent of the electorate did not follow these arguments and voted in favour of the initiative, while 19½ of the 23 cantons also approved the initiative. Voters who identified themselves with parties on the left tended strongly to vote against the initiative; while voters on the right tended equally strongly to support it. The deciding role lay with voters in the middle of the political spectrum. Contrary to previous ballots regarding the rights of foreigners in Switzerland, the middle voters on this occasion tended to go against the recommendations of their parties and a majority of them voted for the initiative (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Vatter 2010</a></span>). Support for the ban was particularly strong in rural areas. The clear margin of victory was nevertheless somewhat surprising given that elite preferences and early public opinion polls had all signalled an outcome against the initiative – albeit by a narrow margin.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second proposal was a popular initiative that sought to ban the export of weapons and munitions. The initiative had been launched by the GSoA (Group for a Switzerland without an Army). Arguments on the side of the proponents were of a moral nature and the initiative was presented as a general contribution to international disarmament efforts, arms control and world peace. The proposal was supported by the SPS/PSS and the Green Party. The government, Parliament and the other major parties rejected the initiative, mainly on economic grounds. They argued that a ban on exporting arms and munitions would put 5,000–10,000 jobs at risk and jeopardise the Swiss arms industry, especially during a time of economic crisis. All cantons, as well as a clear majority of 68.2 per cent of the voters, rejected the proposal.</p>
         
         <p>The final item on the ballot was a federal government decision regarding a special financing model for tasks in the air transportation sector. The proposal envisaged that two‐thirds of the revenues from jet‐fuel taxes would in future be exclusively allocated to finance tasks in air transportation, such as improving technical safety in air travel, environmental conservation and anti‐terrorist measures on airplanes. The proposal was relatively uncontested, although the Social Democrats and the Green Party did not support it. The proposal was accepted by a clear majority of 65.0 per cent of the electorate and all 23 cantons.</p>
