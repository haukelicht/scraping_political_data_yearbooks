         <p>The elections to the European Parliament (EP), held in Austria on 7 June 2009, took place against the background of continuing Euroscepticism (the following section draws largely on Fallend 2009b). According to the Eurobarometer survey of November 2008, only 39 per cent of Austrians believed European Union (EU) membership to be a ‘good thing’, as opposed to 53 per cent in the EU‐27 as a whole; only in three Member States was support lower than in Austria. In 2008, Euroscepticism was further stimulated. First, the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>, the national tabloid with the widest circulation (41.9 per cent of the population) intensified its traditionally EU‐critical stance and campaigned against the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by the national parliament. Second, the Social Democratic Party of Austria (<i>Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs</i>, SPÖ), the leading governing party but troubled by declining public support and defeats in provincial elections (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below), changed its EU policy. Realising that many of their voters were Eurosceptics, Federal Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer and the newly installed Party Chairman, Werner Faymann, declared that future major amendments to EU treaties should be subject to a national referendum – an announcement made, highly symbolically, in a letter to the editor of the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>. Last but not least, the EP elections were likely to be used to protest against the unpopular coalition between the SPÖ and the Christian Democratic Austrian People's Party (<i>Österreichische Volkspartei</i>, ÖVP), which had been renewed in spite of substantial losses of both parties in the 2008 general elections (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009a</a></span>: 884–897).
         </p>
         
         <p>Eight parties ran in the EP elections. In addition to the five parties represented in the <i>Nationalrat</i>, the first chamber of the national parliament, MEP Hans‐Peter Martin, whose list had won an impressive 14 per cent of the votes in 2004, once again challenged the established parties. The remaining parties hardly represented a challenge: the Communists (<i>Kommunistische Partei Österreichs</i>, KPÖ), who had participated in the last elections as part of an alliance of left‐wing groups, now stood alone, whereas the Young Liberals Austria (<i>Junge Liberale Österreich</i>, JuLis) tried to uphold liberalism after the Liberal Forum had failed to enter the <i>Nationalrat</i> in the 2008 general elections.
         </p>
         
         <p>Some of the parties attempted to cope with the prevailing Eurosceptic public attitudes by coming up with new faces. Hannes Swoboda, SPÖ top candidate in 2004 and Vice‐President as well as parliamentary manager of the Social Democratic group in the EP, was re‐nominated after unsuccessful attempts to find a more attractive top candidate. He had to adjust his positions, though. In the past he had steered a clear pro‐EU course, suggested the abolition of Austrian neutrality and defended, in principle, the Turkish EU accession. Now he took on the new party line and demanded a national referendum in case of future EU Treaty amendments. The ÖVP presented the former Minister of the Interior (2000–2004) Ernst Strasser as its new top candidate. Strasser had introduced restrictive immigration laws and was obviously put up as a signal to right‐wing, EU‐critical voters. The former leader of the ÖVP group in the EP, Othmar Karas, was respected as a competent MEP, but not regarded as trump card to win elections. He was therefore only nominated in second position on the party list. As a consequence, a committee of retired and active politicians was established to support Karas.</p>
         
         <p>Surprisingly, the Greens, who had also been disappointed by the result of the 2008 general elections and their failure to attract more protest voters, changed their top candidate as well. At a party congress, Johannes Voggenhuber, prominent MEP since 1995, only received 45.3 per cent of the votes of the delegates and was not re‐nominated. The new party leadership, installed after the general election, attempted to develop a clearer profile and intensify contacts with (EU‐ and Lisbon Treaty‐critical) nongovernmental organisations, like Attac. As Voggenhuber was supported by several provincial party organisations and still popular among the party's rank‐and‐file, the conflict dominated media headlines and surely cost the party votes.</p>
         
         <p>The other parties did not come up with surprises concerning their top candidates. Hans‐Peter Martin, of course, led the list that carried his name. As in 2004, he presented himself as investigator and lonely fighter against party rule and for democracy and transparency. His major goal was to prevent a further strengthening of the right‐wing parties (which had gained votes in the 2008 general election) and what he regarded as their cynical, inhuman policies. Without a party organisation behind him, he depended, as in 2004, on the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>, which in a daily series published excerpts from an EU‐critical book Martin had just finished.
         </p>
         
         <p>The right‐wing, populist Freedom Party of Austria (<i>Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs</i>, FPÖ) relied on its only MEP, Andreas Mölzer. In order to address younger and EU‐critical voters, the party also distributed a comic, in which EU‐Brussels was depicted as centre of luxury, greed, corruption, sinister intrigues and lechery for power. The second right‐wing party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (<i>Bündnis Zukunft Österreich</i>, BZÖ), which had split from the FPÖ in 2005 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1044–1047), nominated a former member of the Ombudsman Board, who predicted the transformation of the EU into a ‘hyper state’. When he presented himself as ‘our ombudsman in Brussels’, the Ombudsman Board obtained a court's decision ordering him to refrain from it. The top candidates of the Communists and the Young Liberals were seldom mentioned in the media and remained unknown.
         </p>
         
         <p>The electoral programmes of the parties for the 2009 EP elections focused on measures against the international financial crisis, social policy, security policy and further EU enlargement, particularly concerning Turkey. In economic policy, all parties, with some modifications, advocated stricter regulations for the financial markets, a European financial transaction tax and extended controls of banks that receive state help. The Greens demanded a ‘New Deal’: up to five million people should find a job as a result of investments in measures to increase energy efficiency and in renewable energies. The Alliance promised to lower Austria's contribution to the EU budget. The Social Democrats and the Greens used the financial crisis to attack neo‐liberal economic philosophy and wanted the EU to be transformed into a ‘social’ Union, obliged to create jobs, secure pensions and (only demanded by the Greens) introduce a basic minimum income. Fighting unemployment also enjoyed prominent status in the ÖVP's programme. As expected, the FPÖ viewed social policy through its xenophobic lens and announced it wanted to build up a social security system especially for foreigners, to send unemployed foreigners back to their home countries, and to introduce strict labour market rules for asylum seekers.</p>
         
         <p>As in other recent national elections, security ranked highly in the parties' campaigns. As usual, it was linked with the immigration and asylum issue. Both SPÖ and ÖVP emphasised that they had prolonged the national army's assistance mission to secure the country's boundaries with its Eastern neighbours (in spite of their inclusion in the Schengen regime in 2007). FPÖ and BZÖ went even further and fought to re‐introduce border controls. Not surprisingly, when the EU Commission announced its plans to harmonise the asylum laws of the EU Member States and distribute the burden of dealing with asylum seekers more justly between the states, all parties – except for the Greens, the List Martin and some SPÖ MEPs – rejected the plan. The ÖVP opposed the proposed opening of the labour market to asylum seekers after six months and warned that the social system was overloaded. The FPÖ used the Commission's initiative to question Austria's allegiance to the Geneva Convention on Refugees altogether.</p>
         
         <p>Turkish EU accession, which had played a significant role in recent national elections, was debated in the EP campaigns of 2009 as well. All parties denied Turkey's fitness for membership at the moment, conforming to the clear anti‐Turkey mood among the public. The FPÖ was in favour of stopping the negotiations and, like the ÖVP, of holding a national referendum on the issue of accession. Only the Greens declared courageously that the EU should continue negotiations in order to support the reform process in Turkey.</p>
         
         <p>As in many an election campaign in Austria, the FPÖ also set the agenda and the tone of these elections. It claimed to be completely unlike its political opponents: consistent, credible, incorruptible and patriotic. Its primary goal was to convince the voters to settle accounts with the hypocritical politicians of the other parties, especially those in government. ‘The Western world in Christian hands’, ‘True representatives of the people instead of EU traitors’, ‘Social solidarity instead of an EU for corporations’ or ‘FPÖ veto against EU asylum madness’ were the major slogans of its election posters and newspaper advertisements. In spite of the fact that Israel had not even applied for EU membership, the FPÖ also placed a newspaper advertisement with the title ‘FPÖ veto against EU accession of Turkey &amp; Israel’. The party was presented as a lonely fighter against the expansion of radical Islam, the mass immigration of Muslims and the involvement of Austria in the bloody conflicts of the Near East. ‘7 June – the day the bill arrives’, posters and advertisements concluded gloomily.</p>
         
         <p>The FPÖ's campaign slogans caused a public debate, which soon distracted attention from European issues. When young neo‐Nazis disturbed a commemoration of former prisoners in the Nazi concentration camp in Ebensee (Upper Austria) by showing the Hitler salute and firing air guns at the participants, Party Chairman Heinz‐Christian Strache condemned the action. At the same time, however, he defended the young people as ‘silly rascals’, who should not be imprisoned, but only needed a ‘sound beating’. Finally, the third President of the <i>Nationalrat</i>, Martin Graf (FPÖ), a controversial figure already because of his membership in an extreme right‐wing student league (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009</a></span>: 899), accused the President of the Jewish Community of being the ‘foster‐father of anti‐fascist left‐wing terrorism’ (after the latter compared statements by the FPÖ's general secretary to those of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels). Social Democratic Federal Chancellor Werner Faymann blamed the party for its ‘unbearable rabble‐rousing’ and called Strache a ‘hate preacher’ (like the Islamic preachers the FPÖ so often attacks). An initiative by SPÖ and the Greens to amend the Constitution in order to enable Parliament to vote a president out of office was not supported by the ÖVP, however, and therefore failed the necessary two‐thirds majority. Strache, in turn, attacked the other parties, as well as the Catholic Church, for being too scared to have an honest debate about the dominant culture (‘<i>Leitkultur</i>’) in Austria and for ignoring people's fears.
         </p>
         
         <p>Some elder statesmen criticised the governing parties for allowing the FPÖ with its excesses to put its stamp on the EP elections. In general, they deplored that, after fourteen years of EU membership, Austria had not yet settled in the Union. The governing parties, they argued, had failed to develop a positive, coherent EU strategy and resorted to populist strategies of ‘blame avoidance’ (making the EU the scapegoat for failures of national politics) or even EU‐bashing.</p>
         
         <p>In spite of the limited EU‐focus of the election campaigns, voter turnout reached 46 per cent (3.6 per cent higher than five years earlier, though still far below turnout in other national elections). The elections resulted in a catastrophe for the SPÖ. With 23.7 per cent, the major governing party lost 9.6 per cent of the votes and three of its seven seats in the EP (it has to be mentioned, however, that in the new period the number of seats for Austria was reduced from 18 to 17). Next to the fall of the FPÖ from 26.9 to 10 per cent in the 2002 general elections, this was the biggest electoral loss of any party at the national level since 1945. Party Chairman Faymann's advances to the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>, which had supported him in the 2008 general election, had not paid off as the tabloid switched its support to Martin this time.
         </p>
         
         <p>According to the opinion research institute GfK Austria, the Social Democrats suffered most from voter abstention: 26 per cent of the non‐voters would have voted for the SPÖ in a general election (17 per cent for the ÖVP, 9 per cent for the FPÖ, 6 per cent for the Greens, 5 per cent for the BZÖ) (Plasser &amp; Ulram 2009: 12). About one‐third of the SPÖ's 2004 voters moved to the List Martin; more than half of them abstained. Not even its core group of blue‐collar workers was convinced by SPÖ concepts: only 17 per cent of them voted for the party (29 per cent for the ÖVP, 24 per cent for the FPÖ, 17 per cent for the List Martin, 7 per cent for the BZÖ, 5 per cent for the Greens) (Perlot &amp; Zeglovits 2009: 4, 11).</p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP lost as well (−2.7 per cent), but regained first place with 30 per cent of the votes and was able to hang on to all six of its seats. Obviously, the match between the official top candidate, Strasser, and the chairman of the party's group in the EP, Karas, did not spoil the party's chances as the two candidates appealed to different groups of the party's traditional voters. Karas received 112,954 preference votes (clearly more than the 7 per cent or 60,124 of the votes for the ÖVP necessary to heave him to the top of the candidate list). However, the party leadership ignored the message and stuck with Strasser's claim to lead the party's EP delegation. The Greens had to pay the price for their internal quarrels and lost 3 per cent of their votes. They were the party where the top candidate was least important as voting motive: only 11 per cent of their voters mentioned it (by contrast, 53 per cent of the voters of the List Martin, 26 per cent each of SPÖ and FPÖ voters, and 22 per cent of ÖVP voters did so) (Perlot &amp; Zeglovits 2009: 14).</p>
         
         <p>Contrary to opinion polls before the elections, the List Martin was able to defend its third place. It even increased its share of the votes by 3.7 to 17.7 per cent. The most important motives to vote for Martin were that he was ‘not a typical politician’ (78 per cent) and that the list was expected to ‘control abuses’ (75 per cent) (Perlot &amp; Zeglovits 2009: 17). Some 70 per cent of its voters were readers of the <i>Kronenzeitung</i> (by comparison with 67 per cent of the FPÖ voters, 58 per cent of the BZÖ voters, 38 per cent of the SPÖ voters, 30 per cent of the ÖVP voters and 6 per cent of the Green voters). At the same time, however, the List Martin could not be unequivocally situated in the ‘anti‐EU’ camp: the majority of its voters (51 per cent) saw more advantages than disadvantages in the EU (95 per cent of the Green voters thought so, 86 per cent of the ÖVP voters and 77 per cent of the SPÖ voters, but only 38 per cent of the FPÖ voters) (Plasser &amp; Ulram 2009: 21).
         </p>
         
         <p>The FPÖ also gained (+6 per cent), but from a low starting point and less than expected. Probably, the anti‐Islamic crusade and the controversial statements relating to Austria's Nazi past were too much even for many EU‐critics. FPÖ voters appreciated, above all, the party's positions ‘against immigration’ (88 per cent) and ‘against Turkey's EU accession’ (81 per cent). More than two‐thirds of its new voters had not voted in 2004. Interestingly, the FPÖ could not repeat its success of the 2008 general election, where it rose to become the strongest party among younger voters (up to the age of 30). In the EP elections, only 19 per cent of them voted for the FPÖ (28 per cent for the ÖVP, 22 per cent for the SPÖ, 14 per cent for the List Martin and the Greens, and 3 per cent for the Alliance) (Perlot &amp; Zeglovits 2009: 4, 10, 19). The Alliance had difficulties in defining its place between the List Martin and the FPÖ and failed to achieve the necessary threshold to be represented in the EP.</p>
         
         <p>The EP election on 7 June 2009 strengthened the Eurosceptic forces in Austria. The two right‐wing parties, FPÖ and BZÖ (the latter running for the first time but failing to win any seats), increased their share of the vote. The Greens, as third opposition party, claimed to continue their pro‐EU policy, but replaced their prominent pro‐EU MEP and intensified contacts with anti‐EU nongovernmental organisations (they lost votes with their new strategy, however). The governing parties, SPÖ and ÖVP, reacted to public opinion and responded to more nationalist, populist and Eurosceptic attitudes. Both ‘left’ parties, the SPÖ and the Greens, lost votes, while the ÖVP held on to all its seats. However, as it is difficult to locate the List Martin on the left‐right axis, the party system did not clearly move to the ‘right’.</p>

         <p>The inter‐party atmosphere between SPÖ and ÖVP in the Faymann I Cabinet, invested in 2008, was certainly better than in its predecessor Gusenbauer I. However, the series of SPÖ defeats in provincial elections (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below) were to strain the coalition. The media as well as SPÖ‐affiliated intellectuals criticised Party Chairman Werner Faymann for his lack of vision, his populist, empty phrases and his tendency to ‘smile away’ problems. Provincial party functionaries and representatives of the party youth considered the party headquarters to be incompetent and incapable of developing strategic analyses, and they blamed Faymann for cuddling up too close to his coalition partner, the ÖVP. In particular, they reproached him for refusing to discuss new capital or property taxes, for accepting a lower than originally envisaged guaranteed minimum income – while at the same time agreeing to generous help for banks and their ‘greedy’ managers (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below).
         </p>
         
         <p>That Faymann, at first, was not interested in claiming the next Austrian EU Commissioner, due to be nominated by the end the year, for his party also caused intra‐party unrest. The incumbent Commissioner, Benita Ferrero‐Waldner, responsible for the EU's neighbourhood policy, had been nominated by the ÖVP. Probably following rumours that the president of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso, would offer Austria the heavyweight position of Commissioner for Agriculture, the ÖVP suggested Wilhelm Molterer, former Minister of Agriculture, Vice‐Chancellor and ÖVP Party Chairman, as candidate. However, Faymann now resisted and spoke up for Ferrero‐Waldner, who had also been ÖVP candidate for the 2004 presidential elections. He argued that he had ‘no trust’ in Molterer, who had terminated the SPÖ–ÖVP coalition in 2008 (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009</a></span>: 886–887). The ÖVP fumed and accused Faymann of having broken a pact. As a compromise, finally, the coalition parties agreed on the Minister of Science, Johannes Hahn (ÖVP), who was to become responsible for regional policy (i.e., for about a third of the EU budget).

         <p>A provision was included in the federal constitution guaranteeing that people's initiatives (<i>Volksbegehren</i>) that Parliament does not treat in the current legislative period (e.g., because it is dissolved before the regular end of its term) do not become obsolete, but will be taken up in the next period (<i>Bundesgesetzblatt</i> I, Nr. 31/2009).
         </p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>After the previous SPÖ–ÖVP coalition (Gusenbauer I) acquired a reputation for constant infighting and only a few effective policy reforms (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2008</a></span>: 906–907; 2009: 893–894), the new Faymann I Cabinet strove to give a better performance. The repercussions of the international financial crisis made this goal, on the one hand, difficult to achieve but, on the other hand, all the more necessary. A big tax reform, amounting to €3.2 billion and aiming at relieving all segments of society, was passed by parliament in March. Incomes up to €17,000 per year were exempted from taxation (affecting 2.7 million people), tax rates were lowered, offsets for childcare costs and the tax threshold for self‐employed persons were raised, and donations to charitable organisations became claimable. Further initiatives, by SPÖ party organisations in some provinces and the SPÖ‐affiliated trade unions, to raise capital and property taxes were rejected by the ÖVP as ‘radical’, backward‐looking concepts and not emulated by Federal Chancellor and SPÖ Party Chairman Faymann. In fact, when it comes to distributive justice, Austria does not rank among the leading countries in the world; economists agree, however, that while the tax system is not very progressive, the welfare system has a highly redistributive effect.
         </p>
         
         <p>A month later, the governing parties agreed on a double federal budget for 2009 and 2010, which economists found acceptable, although they hinted at the high deficit of 4.7 per cent of GDP and the high public debt, which was predicted to rise to 78.5 per cent of GDP until 2013, both figures lying clearly above the EU's Maastricht lines of 3 and 60 per cent, respectively. The OECD suggested that too little of the anti‐recession measures were to go into education and technology and too much into the construction of streets and railways. In June, the governing parties agreed on a new university law, which introduced an obligatory entry phase (which has to be successfully passed to be allowed to continue studying) and a 40 per cent quota for women in all university bodies. In October, students protested against their study conditions and occupied lecture rooms (‘university burns’ was their major slogan). The ÖVP demanded the re‐introduction of tuition fees, which had been abandoned in 2008 (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009</a></span>: 887), in order to regulate the number of students; the SPÖ said ‘no’, however. The Minister of Science refused to talk directly to the occupants, but set up a dialogue forum with politicians and experts. The protests received great media attention, but dropped off after some weeks.
         </p>
         
         <p>In September, the law regulating paid maternity leave (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2008</a></span>: 909) was amended and a fourth, income‐dependent variant was established. Soon afterwards, a new asylum law passed through Parliament, which restricted the freedom of movement of asylum seekers and extended in‐custody‐pending‐deportation. In November, Parliament adopted a law which gave homosexual almost the same rights as heterosexual partnerships. Up to this time, Austria was the only country in Western Europe, besides Ireland and Italy, where homosexual partnerships were not acknowledged by law. The ÖVP blocked an earlier bill because it was afraid that it could undermine the institution of marriage. It only agreed to the new law under the condition that the homosexual partnership ceremonies were to be conducted before the district governor and not in registry offices, and that adoption of children was not allowed.
         </p>
         
         <p>As shown above, the SPÖ–ÖVP government successfully enacted several policy reforms. In other areas, however, conflicts prevailed between the two coalition parties, but also between the federal and the provincial governments, and no solutions could be found. In February, the Minister of Education (SPÖ) proposed that teachers be obliged to work two more hours per week in class. According to OECD studies, the time Austrian teachers spend in class is below average. The Minister argued that she needed the money thus saved for other reforms, like smaller classes, whole‐day childcare, language training for children of immigrants and so on. However, her proposal led to a fierce confrontation with the ÖVP‐led trade union branch of teachers, lasting several weeks. After the trade unions threatened to go on strike, the proposal was withdrawn, although some bonuses for teachers were cut. The fact that the party speaker of the ÖVP for education was at the same time chairman of the trade union of the public servants did not have a positive effect on the negotiations.</p>
         
         <p>The international financial crisis, which forced the government to increase the budget deficit in order to support banks and enterprises (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009</a></span>: 899), also promoted debates about public sector efficiency. Austria is a federal state, characterised by only limited responsibilities of the provinces, though; this is why state reform has been prominent on the political agenda continuously since the beginning of the 1990s. However, as the media and the Audit Office have both continuously deplored, major public sector reforms have failed so far. In November, for example, the members of the provincial governments responsible for finances rejected, not for the first time, proposals by the Federal Ministry of Finance to increase the tax autonomy of the provinces because they feared that it might not only stimulate economic competition, but also fuel a race to the bottom.
         </p>
         
         <p>Tax reform was not the only issue where plans by the federal government met resistance from the provinces. Since 2006, the governments of both territorial levels have been negotiating a uniform guaranteed minimum income to replace (provincially differentiated) social benefits. The talks were complicated as different positions of the national governing parties had also to be adjusted (the ÖVP was worried lest the income be sufficiently high to enable recipients to live life in a ‘social hammock’). Finally, parties and governments agreed to introduce a uniform guaranteed minimum income of €733 per month (for individuals) in September 2010. Provinces with lower social benefits were to compensate for the difference. It was assumed that about 270,000 people would benefit from the new income.</p>
         
         <p>Health policy was another controversial issue (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009</a></span>: 898). At the end of 2008, the deficit of the provincially organised sickness insurance companies had amounted to €1.2 billion (in particular, the large company in Vienna was accused of inefficient management). In 2009, the federal government decided to pour an additional €600 million into the companies and to redistribute resources from less to more loss‐making companies. The budgetary support was given only on the condition that the health insurance companies saved €1.7 billion through efficiency measures by 2013. Naturally, the provincial governments of more efficient companies protested and even appealed to the Constitutional Court. More far‐reaching reforms to increase public sector efficiency were not passed during 2009.
         </p>
         
         <p>The coalition parties not only had problems with each other and with the provinces, but also with the opposition. As in previous years (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2008</a></span>: 909–911; 2009: 897–898), a parliamentary committee of inquiry was set up and, as in the past, the proceedings ended up bringing parliament into disrepute. The eighteenth committee of enquiry since 1945 was to investigate several issues related to the secret services. The mobile phone of a BZÖ MP had been monitored by order of the public prosecutor, probably violating the MP's immunity (the MP himself suspected a deliberate action by a government agency against opposition politicians). A Green MP was accused by the FPÖ of asking a former policeman to look into alleged contacts of the FPÖ to the right‐wing extreme scene. Finally, the general secretary of the FPÖ had been used by the secret service of Kazakhstan, which circulated information about the involvement of the former ambassador to Austria in drug dealing and money laundering in order to prevent him from running for presidency in his home country. The opposition parties were dissatisfied because a representative of a governing party was elected chairman of the committee of enquiry, and even more so because the former ÖVP minister's company had economic relations with Kazakhstan. The committee revealed dubious contacts of Austrian politicians to the Kazakh secret service and information leaks of the Austrian secret services to politicians. When the governing parties disagreed about summoning incumbent as well as former SPÖ and ÖVP ministers, the opposition parties threatened to block all laws requiring a two‐thirds majority, including the EU's Service Directive, which was to be ratified by the end of the year. The governing parties, which deplored the ‘political theatre’ in the committee, refused to be blackmailed and stopped the enquiries before a written final report was produced. All parties agreed that future committees of enquiry should only take place after the rules had been adapted.

         <p>The province of Carinthia often hit the media headlines in 2009, and usually not to its advantage. First, the former provincial bank Hypo Alpe Adria, since 2007 owned by a majority of a Bavarian bank (the BayernLB), almost went bankrupt. Because of allegations of risky deals in Central and Eastern Europe, mafia contacts, the excessive price the BayernLB paid for its shares, high professional fees of a tax consultant (who happened to be the friend of a member of the provincial government) and false confirmation by the Austrian Central Bank before the deal that the situation of the Hypo was ‘non‐distressed’, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Public Prosecutor's Office started investigations. Nevertheless, as the bank was regarded as ‘system‐relevant’ and as the national government was afraid of a negative domino‐effect, the bank was nationalised at the end of year; €450 million had to be contributed out of the federal budget (the bank had already been supported by €900 million in 2008). Apart from the criminal aspects of the case, public criticism focused above all on the fact that the province of Carinthia assumed liability for the bank up to €18 billion (i.e., 857 (!) per cent of the provincial budget) and that Carinthian politicians, in spite of the critical situation of the bank, continued to distribute inflation compensation payments to recipients of social benefits. However, suggestions by federal politicians that tighter control mechanisms over provincial budgets be introduced were immediately rejected by major provincial politicians.</p>
         
         <p>As in previous years (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 889–890; 2008: 915), the issue of the bilingual (German and Slovenian) local signs in the province of Carinthia embarrassed journalists, constitutional lawyers and diplomats concerned about Austria's image in the world. Since 2001, the provincial government, led by governors of the FPÖ and BZÖ, respectively, has ignored rulings of the Constitutional Court (17 so far, in fact), which, in accordance with the State Treaty of 1955, have imposed bilingual local signs on regions where Slovenes constitute at least 10 per cent of the population. In 2009, the conflict reached a preposterous new peak, when the public prosecutor stopped investigations of abuse of office by the incumbent Provincial Governor. The Governor had assisted in undermining the Court's rulings by shifting the incriminated German local signs a few metres, placing small Slovenian signs under the German ones and so on. Yet, the prosecutor, supported by the Federal Ministry of Justice, hinted that the Governor had no legal education, and that no deliberate action against the Court's rulings and no concrete damage could be detected. Federal Chancellor Faymann (SPÖ) criticised the carry‐on in Carinthia, but announced he would take action based only on a consensus of the majority of the provincial parties and with the involvement of the population.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, at the end of the year, the (federal) FPÖ and the Carinthian BZÖ fused, thereby changing the party landscape in Austria. In 2005, the self‐designated ‘constructive’ forces split from the right‐wing, populist FPÖ and established the BZÖ. The former FPÖ Party Chairman and Provincial Governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, was elected chairman of the new party, which continued to be part of the national government in a coalition with the ÖVP until 2007 (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1044–1047). Contrary to the party leadership's expectations, however, the BZÖ failed to enter any provincial parliament outside Carinthia, where Haider successfully developed his ‘model Carinthia’. After Haider died in a car accident in 2008, the new BZÖ party leadership tried to pursue a right‐wing, liberal course, following the model of the German Free Democrats (FDP). Tensions between the new leadership and the still populist Carinthian organisation of the BZÖ intensified. As a consequence, although leading party functionaries of BZÖ and FPÖ in the past had fiercely attacked each other and denied that a reunion of the two parties was under consideration, the Carinthian BZÖ leadership split from the federal party organisation and joined forces with the (federal) FPÖ, following another German model: the cooperation between the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the pan‐German Christian Democratic Union (CDU). In January 2010, three of the Carinthian BZÖ members of the <i>Nationalrat</i> left their parliamentary group (at the same time, a fourth MP was expelled from the BZÖ, which now is comprised of only 17 members).
         </p>
         
         <p>During 2009, in no less than four (of the nine) provinces, general elections were held, starting with Carinthia and Salzburg on 1 March. The most interesting question in Carinthia was if the BZÖ would be able to repeat the electoral success of the FPÖ of 2004 after the death of its charismatic party chairman Haider five months before the elections. The BZÖ leadership exploited Haider's death and the cult‐like worship of many Carinthians for him in its electoral campaign and promised to respect his political legacy (generous social benefits, strict anti‐asylum policy, no further bilingual local signs). Xenophobic (‘Negro’) jokes by Haider's successor as Governor did not harm the party. On the contrary, the BZÖ won 44.9 per cent of the votes (i.e., +2.3 per cent compared to the FPÖ in 2004). This was a shock to the SPÖ, which lost 9.7 per cent (now 28.7 per cent), and embarrassing for the opinion pollsters, who had predicted a head‐to‐head race between both parties. The ÖVP was able to increase its share of the votes from 11.6 per cent (its all‐time low after 1945) to 16.8 per cent. The Greens lost 1.5 per cent, but with 5.2 per cent narrowly passed the 5 per cent threshold for parliamentary representation. On the other hand, the FPÖ only gained 3.8 per cent – clearly under the threshold. As a consequence of the constitutional provision that all major parties are represented in government according to their parliamentary strength (the so‐called ‘<i>Proporz</i>’ rule), the new government was to include members of BZÖ, SPÖ and ÖVP. The government programme, however, was only signed by BZÖ and ÖVP.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Salzburg, where the SPÖ conquered the position of provincial governor from the ÖVP in 2004, the SPÖ, in spite of the considerable communication skills displayed by its governor, lost 6 per cent of the vote. However, with 39.4 per cent, it defended its top place. The relations between both parties were generally described as constructive, and their election campaigns as rather meaningless. The ÖVP, headed by the son of a former governor with a business‐like appearance and embraced by the SPÖ in a coalition, failed in its aim of regaining the top spot; instead, it also lost (−1.4 per cent) and achieved only 36.5 per cent. The FPÖ won 13 per cent (i.e., +4.3 per cent), and the Greens lost 0.6 per cent and ended up with 7.4 per cent. The BZÖ failed to enter parliament with 3.7 per cent. After the elections, the SPÖ–ÖVP coalition was renewed.</p>
         
         <p>The elections in Vorarlberg, which had been ruled by an ÖVP–FPÖ coalition since 1974 (in spite of the fact that the ÖVP, except from 1999 to 2004, had always commanded an absolute majority of seats in Parliament), took place on 20 September. The ÖVP lost 4.1 per cent of the votes (now 50.8 per cent); it was able to maintain its absolute majority, however. The big winner of the elections was the FPÖ, which rose from 12.9 to 25.1 per cent. The FPÖ party chairman had led a xenophobic election campaign in which he warned, for example, that in 2050 more than half of the children in Vorarlberg would be of Muslim origin. On its posters, the party demanded ‘Parent money for native families’, ‘German is a duty’ and ‘No minarets’. When he accused the director of a Jewish museum, who had criticised the FPÖ campaign, to be a ‘Jewish exile from the USA’, he crossed the line. The Provincial Governor and ÖVP party chairman, a pragmatist, who stood up for reliability and security in his campaign, announced he would terminate the coalition with the FPÖ after the elections. In vain, the other parties struggled to heave their issues onto the political agenda. The SPÖ lost 6.9 per cent (with 10 per cent, the Social Democrats reached their all‐time low), while the Greens slightly rose from 10.2 to 10.6 per cent (however, they missed a fifth mandate, which would have created the first MP in Vorarlberg of Turkish origin).</p>
         
         <p>The round of elections was completed by the general election on 27 September in Upper Austria. Like Carinthia, Upper Austria is ruled by a <i>Proporz</i> government, consisting since 2003 of ÖVP, SPÖ and Greens. After the last election, ÖVP and Greens agreed on a ‘coalition within the coalition’. The ÖVP campaign focussed on the incumbent provincial governor; in fact, the election posters renounced the party label. The ÖVP reached 46.8 per cent of the votes (i.e., +3.4 per cent). The SPÖ, whose chairman was regarded as ‘left populist’, fell dramatically, from 38.3 to 24.9 per cent – its worst result since 1945. In spite of intra‐party criticism against the cooperation with the ÖVP, the Green leadership managed to repeat its electoral result of 2003 (with 9.2 per cent, it gained 0.1 per cent). With typical slogans (against criminality and immigration) the FPÖ rose from 8.4 to 15.3 per cent. The BZÖ tried to draw a clear line between itself and the FPÖ, and presented itself as a ‘social, not radical’ party. Although it was headed by the sister of former FPÖ and BZÖ chairman Haider, the party achieved only 2.8 per cent and failed to enter Parliament, however. Because of the <i>Proporz</i> rule, all four parliamentary parties are represented in the new government. As in 2003, however, only ÖVP and Greens signed a coalition agreement.
         </p>
         
         <p>Taking all four provincial elections together, the clear winners of the year were the ÖVP (with increases in vote shares in two provinces and the defence of the absolute majority in one province), the FPÖ (with high gains in all provinces, except Carinthia) and – albeit only in Carinthia – the BZÖ. On the other hand, the clear losers were the SPÖ and, to a minor degree, the Greens. The SPÖ lost in all four provinces, in two of them drastically. The Greens maintained their shares or lost slightly; yet they were unable to profit from the widespread political disaffection or the weakness of the SPÖ in particular. As expected, the national leaderships of those parties that won interpreted the election results as a momentum for themselves, while the leaderships of those parties that lost claimed to see only province‐specific reasons and repercussions.</p>
         
         <p>Another provincial election was due only in 2010, but had effects already in 2009: the election in Burgenland. In the last days of the year, the Federal Minister of the Interior, Maria Fekter (ÖVP), announced her plan to establish a new, third reception centre for asylum seekers in the small municipality (960 inhabitants) of Eberau in Burgenland, near the border with Hungary. SPÖ and ÖVP had agreed on the reception centre in their coalition agreement of 2008. However, the announcement was badly timed. Because of the impending elections, the incumbent provincial governor (SPÖ) and all major parties objected to the project; the provincial parliament unanimously passed a respective resolution. Finally, the national governing parties gave in to demands for a consultative referendum on the issue. Not surprisingly, in the referendum, held in February 2010, an overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of Eberau (90.1 per cent) dismissed the plan. The third reception centre for asylum seekers was politically dead with this and not only for Eberau.</p>
         
         <p>With respect to foreign relations, Austria experienced major problems in 2009 because of its tight bank secrecy. To fight tax fraud, both the OECD and the EU increased pressure on those member states that did not cooperate enough to exchange information with the tax authorities of others. The EU Commission estimated that tax fraud in the Union amounted to about 2.5 per cent of the GDP (i.e., €250 billion per year). Like Belgium, Luxemburg, Switzerland and other countries, Austria was not included on the OECD's ‘black list’ of tax oases, but on a ‘grey list’ and was urged to loosen its bank secrecy, which so far had obliged foreign tax authorities to instigate criminal proceedings in order to get information on a bank account. Together with the other EU Member States of Belgium and Luxemburg, Austria had been granted a dispensation in 2003 from automatic information exchange; instead, these countries had agreed to collect taxes at source. In September, finally, the <i>Nationalrat</i> ratified a mutual assistance law so that Austria was deleted from the grey list of the OECD.
         </p>
         
         <p>The EU also played a significant role with respect to the rescue of the major national airline, Austrian Airlines (AUA). At the end of July, the EU Commission approved of the takeover of AUA by the German Lufthansa. AUA, which was controlled by the national government (through the company ÖIAG, holding 41.6 per cent of the shares), had accumulated a deficit of €430 million in 2008. The ÖIAG was criticised for having backed a stand‐alone variant for too long and for having allowed political influence. Its favourite for a takeover was Lufthansa, which offered only a symbolic price of €366,000, however, and declared that it would not be interested if the Austrian federal government did not subsidise the deal with €500 million. The EU Commission examined in particular whether the government subsidy violated the EU's competition law, and whether the proceedings had been transparent and fair. Finally, it approved the takeover, under the condition of a fundamental restructuring plan and the opening of certain routes to other airlines.</p>
