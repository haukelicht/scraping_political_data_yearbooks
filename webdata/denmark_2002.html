         <p>It gradually became clear in the beginning of 2003 that military action against Iraq was approaching. The question was whether Denmark ought to participate actively in such military action and, if the occasion should arise, whether active military participation required the adoption of a new resolution in the United Nations (UN) Security Council in addition to the existing resolutions 687 (passed in 1991) and 1441. In January, Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and the Heads of Government of seven other European Union (EU) countries issued an open letter in a number of international media expressing their support for the American campaign against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Of political significance was the fact that neither France nor Germany signed the letter, thereby demonstrating the lack of consensus within the EU regarding attitudes toward the United States and a possible war against Iraq. The Social Democrats, the Social Liberal Party and the Christian People's Party, all of which had previously been included in the broad political majority supporting security policy, refused to lend their support to any Danish commitment to send soldiers to war in the absence of a new UN mandate. A signal was thus sent to the Government: decide whether to pursue foreign policy solely with the support of the Danish People's Party or maintain the broad majority. The Socialist People's Party and the Unity List had indicated clearly that they were opposed to Danish participation in war under any and all circumstances.</p>
         
         <p>Hope of arriving at a solution capable of winning support from all of the great powers in the Security Council was definitively abandoned on 17 March. The Danish Government then decided to participate in the war on the grounds that the already‐adopted UN resolutions provided a sufficient legal basis for doing so. The Prime Minister was of the clear opinion that, in a conflict between dictatorship and democracy, one is morally obligated to support democracy. The Opposition vigorously disputed the existence of a valid basis for war with respect to international law, as the UN weapons inspectors had yet to determine whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The most serious accusation raised by the Opposition was that the Government had violated the broad consensus regarding Danish foreign policy; the Danish People's Party stood alone in their support of the Government. For the first time, Danish soldiers were sent to war without the support of a broad political majority. Regardless of the landmark character of the decision and the uncompromising nature of the debate, the Government and the Social Democrats were able successfully to negotiate a contribution of troops to a stabilising force stationed in the Bashra area subsequent to the fall of Baghdad.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>All things considered, the course of events revealed that the Government had taken yet another marked step in the direction of the activist line of foreign policy that Denmark had taken up some years previously. The Government had clearly demonstrated a strong affiliation to the United States; it did not shy away from going against France and Germany, just as it did not shy away from breaking the broad collaboration regarding foreign policy in the Danish Folketing, and based its decision solely on the support of votes from the Danish People's Party. The majority existed and it was exercised. The Danish People's Party was certainly quite satisfied with the serious setback dealt to EU joint efforts regarding foreign policy. The very basis for the decision and thereby also the credibility of the Government remained a point of political dispute throughout 2003 on account of the failure to discover weapons of mass destruction and the inability to involve the UN.</p>
         
         <p>With respect to fiscal policy, the Conservative People's Party applied pressure from within the Government for the proposal of tax reform. The Liberal Party was more half‐hearted in this regard: stop tax increases, yes, but actual taxation reductions? In February, the Government issued its tax proposal. Income tax was to be reduced by DKK10.6 billion over four years. The Prime Minister declared this to be historic in terms of a reduction in the taxation of work that was not accompanied by increases to other forms of taxation or duties.</p>
         
         <p>The reactions of the other parties indicated that this proposal could be passed only on the strength of negotiations with the Danish People's Party. The Danish People's Party had been continuously and generally positive towards it, though they also raised their own demands that were to be met prior to the completion of any settlement. These demands included greater tax relief for low‐income groups than proposed by the Government and assurances that the reduction would not influence the resources to be allocated to achieve improvements to welfare in the years to come, including the so‐called ‘seniors’ cheque’ (i.e., money sent directly to the poorest pensioners).</p>
         
         <p>The politically significant aspect of the tax reform passed in April solely on the basis of the votes of the Government coalition parties and the Danish People's Party was that the latter had now become a conciliatory partner and was co‐responsible for fiscal policy for years to come. Moreover, this policy was quite removed from the position adopted by the party at its inaugural national congress in June 1996, where a declaration was made to work for a significant reduction of income tax. At the annual meeting in September 2000, the party had renounced its demand for the reduction of personal taxation to 30 per cent; now, in 2003, they had the Government proposal cut by DKK1 billion and in general accepted the high level of taxation in Denmark. Furthermore, the Government once again demonstrated that it had a majority behind it, which they were capable of putting to use. This was also the case with regards to the budget, which was passed solely with the support of votes from the Danish People's Party.</p>
         
         <p>However, the Government suffered a serious defeat when it was forced to withdraw the proposed reform of the rules for unemployment insurance. An accusation was raised that the rules constituted a breach of the assurances made by the coalition parties during the election campaign. Despite withdrawing the proposed reform, the damage was done: two‐thirds of the electorate was of the opinion that the Government had lost credibility. The course of events revealed that the campaign led by the Liberal Party against then‐Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and the lack of credibility enjoyed by the Social Democrats since the so‐called ‘<i>efterlønssagen</i>’ (‘the early retirement case’) in 1998 had now boomeranged, hitting both the Liberal Party and Anders Fogh Rasmussen himself. The concept of credibility had become an independent issue in political competition. This also demonstrated the problems that are invited when all‐too explicit guarantees are issued during an election campaign, as they restrict politicians’ opportunities to make the decisions that can be necessitated by subsequent developments. The case clearly illustrated the dilemma characterising representative democracy in terms of the tension between trusting the elected politicians and the responsibility of the politicians to make the decisions that they deem necessary: political leadership versus binding contracts with the electorate.
         </p>
         
         <p>The political leader of the Christian People's Party, Jann Sjursen, announced in May 2003 that he was withdrawing his candidacy for the upcoming parliamentary election on account of opposition towards the re‐naming of the party. Intense debate within the party ensued. The Christian People's Party national congress in October therefore promised to be one of the most decisive in the history of the party. It was unsatisfactory for the party continually to hover around the minimum percentage of votes required for representation (i.e., 2 per cent of the popular vote). New party leader Marianne Karlsmose was convinced that the party's values were shared by a greater percentage of the electorate than merely those who had voted for the party in the last election. She represented the faction in the party interested in making it more open and ‘media‐conscious’. Karlsmose also wished to build on the party's position in the middle of the spectrum in Danish politics and broaden their appeal beyond practicing Christians. It was to be a political party, not a congregation. Changing the name of the party to ‘Christian Democrats’ was intended as a signal of renewal. The result was 218 votes for the new name and 93 votes against.</p>
         
         <p>The Government did not emerge from 2003 as well as it had from 2002. Support among the electorate began to ebb, unemployment increased, and the Government began to struggle to maintain the initiative and control over the agenda and their credibility was dented slightly. Several episodes indicated that tension was developing within the Government. After two years, a new Government loses some of its novelty, routine begins to set in and responsibility takes its toll. The pattern of cooperation and conflict had not changed. The Government could continue to count on parliamentary support from the Danish People's Party, as clearly demonstrated in the budget negotiations, and the influence of this party in Danish politics increased steadily in line with the number of multi‐year settlements in which it was involved. Social Democratic criticism of Government policy now appeared more focused, though the Government was not faced by an assembled and close‐knit opposition: the Social Liberal Party entered into settlements with the Government in relation to specific policy areas, while the Social Democrats were held from influence, and in other instances the opposite was the case.</p>
