         <p>This is my tenth commentary for the <i>Political Data Yearbook</i> (either as a sole writer or jointly with Ian McAllister or James Cotton) and I have decided on a new arrangement. Hitherto, the pattern was essentially chronological. This article departs by considering the events or issues in their order of importance as assessed by me. However, first let it be noted that there were certain characteristics that remained identical between 1 January 2002 and 1 January 2003. The federal cabinet was identical; as was the Leader of the Liberal Party (John Howard). So, too, were the leaders of the National Party (John Anderson), the Labor Party (Simon Crean, who is also Leader of the Opposition) and the Greens (Senator Bob Brown).

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss2"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss2-title"> The Bali bombings</h3>
            
            <p>It is generally agreed that the big event of the year for Australia took place in a foreign country. On 12 October 2002 bombs went off at the Sari Club and at Paddy's Bar near Kuta Beach on the Indonesian island of Bali. The Sari Club bomb was the biggest and most destructive of the three detonated – 1,000 kilograms of explosives were packed into a filing cabinet inside a van that was driven to Jalan Legian (the tourist strip at Kuta) and parked outside the packed nightclub at around 11 pm. It was a Saturday night and Paddy's Bar, across the narrow street jammed with tourists, motorbikes and cars, was doing a roaring trade. The big bomb had four triggers, three of them backups to the first‐choice device set off by a mobile telephone. The result was a catastrophe that replaced Australian complacency with fear and suspicion. The blast and the resulting conflagrations destroyed the Sari Club and Paddy's Bar, killing nearly 200 people, almost all of them tourists, including 88 Australians.</p>
            
            <p>Not surprisingly the American ‘9/11’ of the previous year became ‘October the Twelfth’ for Australians. Indeed Australia saw a greater percentage of its population killed by a single terrorist act than had occurred for the United States. The result was a greater emphasis on security in a number of ways. Travel warnings for Australians going to overseas destinations were issued, much to the annoyance of Muslim communities in Australia and overseas. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) started upon a course of action described by some as ‘harassing Muslims’. ASIO also sought greater powers, which the Howard Government was only too willing to grant. However, a dispute between the House of Representatives and the Senate about the nature of those extra powers precluded the legislation from going into effect. An AUS$15 million campaign was launched by the Government, which began with the themes ‘Australia is not immune from terrorism’ and ‘be alert but not alarmed’.</p>
            
            <p>It very quickly became accepted that the organisation behind this latest piece of terrorism was Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which is illegal but powerful in Indonesia. JI is a Southeast Asian network of Islamic militants said to be linked to Osama bin Laden's al‐Qaeda network. It did not take the Indonesians long to make arrests, but convictions may take some time. Meanwhile Australian leaders (John Howard, John Anderson and Simon Crean, in particular) went to Indonesia to assist in services for the dead and the general perception was that Howard's speech was very good and statesmanlike. Newspapers treated the whole event as though it were the Australian equivalent of ‘9/11’.</p>
            
            <p>By the end of 2002, Indonesian police had arrested 17 Islamic fundamentalists, all Indonesian nationals, including five accused major plotters who face the death penalty. Three terrorists (Amrozi, 39, his brother Ali Imron, 30, and the operational commander Imam Samudra, 35, a veteran terrorist who had spent two years in Afghanistan) confessed to roles in the bomb attack, but all denied they exploded the Sari bomb. Imam Samudra, upon being arrested, said that: ‘I chose Bali because it is the meeting place of international terrorists like the US, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Israel and Communist China. Bali is a sinful place located in a country where Muslims are in the majority’. He also admitted involvement in a bomb attack on two Catholic churches on Christmas Eve 2000, as well as a later attack on the Philippines consulate in Jakarta.</p>
            
            <p>While professionals in the field of terrorist assessment believed Bali was targeted against the West in general, the great majority of Australians believed that Australia was the specific target. This is understandable as four times as many Australians were killed as any other nationality in the attack. Another important arrest was that of 42 year‐old Ali Ghufron (alias ‘Mukhlas’) who described himself as ‘a teacher of Arabic and the Koran’ and who had fought in the jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan between 1986 and 1989. He met Osama bin Laden and, though an Indonesian national, headed the Malaysia and Singapore chapter of JI. The purpose of the Bali bombings, according to him, was that: ‘We wanted to terrorise the government of America.’ Police were to claim late in 2002 that Mukhlas was directly involved in the blasts. Previously the police had believed he was merely the supreme commander who conceived and financed the operation from a distance, but they came to believe that Mukhlas actually had traveled to Bali to survey the scene and check Samudra's plans in detail. The two Afghanistan veterans shared a safe house in the Bali capital of Denpasar, where Mukhlas's two brothers, Amrozi and Ali Imron, also stayed.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

            <p>This brief description of the Bali bombings and aftermath is all that is needed in a commentary such as this. The point is that the details do not really matter. It was the psychology created in Australia that was important. The extent that everyone says: ‘Australia was changed forever’ may contain the clue to political developments over the next ten years. This may be strange – given that the professional assessment was of the West in general as the target rather than Australia in particular – but it is a fact of political life.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> The refugee issue</h3>
            
            <p>Much of my commentary for 2001 was taken up by the refugee issue. In particular, I made clear my view that the Howard Government used propaganda against refugees as a major weapon in its campaign for re‐election. It invented a so‐called ‘Pacific Solution’ to the ‘problem’ of asylum‐seekers, which involved making arrangements with Papua New Guinea and Nauru so that those countries should take the refugees who actually wanted to come to Australia. The election campaign used the phrase ‘border protection’, but its purpose was to tap xenophobia within the Australian community.</p>
            
            <p>I referred last year to the extraordinary degree of luck going the Government's way, which added to the draconian measures it took. The luck continued in 2002. Not a single boat carrying unauthorised arrivals was allowed to land. Thus the Government was able to claim 2002 as an outstanding year of success in anti‐refugee policies that are based on turning asylum‐seeker boats back and, where that fails, persecuting them within Australia.</p>
            
            <p>However, two aspects of these policies came back to haunt the Government in 2002. For several years now, they have maintained so‐called ‘detention centres’ (a euphemism for refugee prisons), of which two are in suburbs of big cities – Villawood (Sydney) and Maribyrnong (Melbourne). The other three are in remote locations – Port Hedland and Curtin (Western Australia) on the distant northern coast and Woomera (South Australia) in the desert. During the year, but especially in the hot months of January and December, there were hunger strikes and riots at these ‘detention centres’. The most bizarre form of protest was ‘lip‐stitching’ whereby imprisoned refugees render themselves dumb. While decent people would react to these protests by asking whether there might be something wrong with prison conditions, that was not the official reaction. The Minister for Immigration, Philip Ruddock, described these protests as ‘grisly’ and moralised about how the Government would not be ‘coerced’ by the detainees nor would he respond to ‘intimidation’. Escaping detainees were mostly re‐captured, although some successfully sought asylum among refugee advocates and their networks. Although, under Australian law, it is a serious crime to harbour escaping refugees (carrying a greater penalty than if one did the same for an escaping convicted criminal), there are still many Australians humanitarian enough and courageous enough to do so.</p>
            
            <p>The December riots were the worst. By then the Government had established the new, high‐tech ‘detention centre’ at Baxter in South Australia, a place not quite as desolate as Woomera but where the combination of devices would keep the detainees under very secure lock and key. The firm that manages these places – Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd (ACM) – had assured the Government all would be okay. However, in the end, all of the ACM sites were affected by the riots and AUS$8 million of damage was done. The Government went into propaganda overdrive about the damage, even showing television footage to prove how criminal the detainees really were. Opponents, however, pointed out that if the Government was willing to spend AUS$300 million per year keeping refugees out of Australia and persecuting the remainder, it was scarcely in a position to complain when their protests added AUS$8 million per year to the overall cost.</p>
            
            <p>In my commentary last year I wrote, on page 902:</p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>On 10 October the Minister for Defence, Peter Reith (who was retiring at the election), released photos claiming to be of two children thrown overboard. It was proved after polling day that the photos were, in effect, a fabrication having been taken the day after claimed (that is, on 8 October) of an Australian Navy ship rescuing children who were in the water because an Indonesian fishing vessel carrying asylum‐seekers had sunk.</p>

            <p>The non‐Government majority in the Senate resolved to set up a committee of inquiry into what was quaintly termed ‘a certain maritime incident’. The inquiry heard witnesses but not ministers, former ministers or their staffs, all of whom claimed privilege. After lengthy hearings and arguments, the committee reported, in effect proving that the Government had lied and fabricated evidence. Government senators on the committee dissented, arguing that the inquiry was a political stunt. In overall political terms, the whole exercise was a waste – albeit useful for historians. It had no effect on the popularity of the Government as recorded by the opinion polls. There can be only this sad conclusion. While ordinary people resent being lied to on matters that really affect them (such as taxes, jobs, education and health), they actually want to be lied to when it comes to refugees. On such matters ordinary people do not want to know the truth. They are content to allow innocent men, women and children to be imprisoned without charge. They believe (and want to believe) the official propaganda in a circumstance in which the official Opposition refuses to oppose. Who cares about foreigners, anyway?</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> The Australian states</h3>
            
            <p>The year 2002 witnessed the end of a process that had been going on for some years. It is now the case that all six State Premiers and both Territory Chief Ministers are from the Labor Party – namely the party that constitutes the federal Opposition.</p>
            
            <p>The most recent change of government, in South Australia, was the result of a general election held on 9 February 2002, which produced a highly disputed and very narrow win for Labor. Analysts then proceeded to debate why it should be that the federal government should be of one colour, while all jurisdictions at the next level below should be of the opposite colour. No satisfactory theory emerged to explain this unusual phenomenon.</p>
            
            <p>If anything, as the year progressed things improved even more for Labor in the States/Territories. Not one of these Labor governments seemed to be in any trouble in the opinion polls. On 20 July, the Tasmanian Labor Government easily won a second term. At the end of the year, on 30 November, our second most populous state, Victoria, went to the polls and returned the Labor Government (previously a minority government) with a huge majority in the Legislative Assembly (lower house) plus a majority in the Legislative Council (upper house).</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss5"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss5-title"> The rise of the Greens</h3>
            
            <p>During 2002, the federal Labor party suffered a minor disaster. It lost a seat at a by‐election – the first time an Opposition had suffered such a defeat since 1921. On 16 August, Stephen Martin, the Labor member for Cunningham (NSW), resigned his seat. Cunningham is the electoral name for what is, in effect, the city of Wollongong on the coast south of Sydney. It is an industrial area based on steel manufacturing that has always been safely held by Labor. However, various problems associated with candidate selection in particular resulted in the Green candidate, Michael Organ, taking the seat at the by‐ election held on 19 October.</p>
            
            <p>If Labor had a bad year in 2002, its woes were as nothing compared to those of the Australian Democrats who suffered a veritable <i>annus horribilis.</i> The Democrats had, in April 2001, replaced their leader, Senator Meg Lees, with Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, both of whom came from South Australia. Although they performed reasonably well under the new leadership at the November 2001 federal election, their vote was not impressive enough to take the pressure off the new leader. Then came the February 2002 South Australian state election where the Democrats’ performance was quite poor. This put pressure on the party and Lees resigned her membership and became an Independent. After further tensions, Stott Despoja resigned her leadership on 21 August. The party rank‐and‐file then went through the long process again and on 23 October Senator Andrew Bartlett (Queensland) became leader.
            </p>
            
            <p>It has been the case for some years that the Democrats and Greens have been competing with each other for the same kind of support – namely the humanitarian and environment vote. By and large, the Democrats had been getting the better of this competition but danger signals flashed for them in 2001. Then in 2002 the competition turned in favour of the Greens. Not only were they able to win Cunningham (when the Democrats had never won a seat except under PR), but the year ended with the Victoria election at which the Greens turned in a very impressive performance. In the election for the Legislative Council (seen as the critical test), the Greens secured 10.9 per cent of the vote while the Democrats won only 1.8 per cent.</p>
            
            <p>None of that is to say the Democrats are finished. In the PR‐elected Senate there are presently 35 supporters of the Howard Government, 28 Labor, seven Democrats, two Greens, one from Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party and three Independents. (Only one of the Independents was elected as an Independent. The others are Meg Lees who had defected from the Democrats and one defector from Labor). That means the Democrats hold power in the Senate, which may help them at the next general election that, under the Australian three‐year term, is likely to be held in November 2004.</p>

         <p>Looking at my commentaries over the years I am struck at how little attention I have been paying to economic matters. The most appalling lapse was my failure last year to mention the HIH debacle. The insurance company of that name collapsed in March 2001, creating a loss of AUS$5.3 billion. It was Australia's Enron. So scandalous was it perceived to be that a Royal Commission was established in September 2001 to inquire into all the circumstances of the collapse. Hearings began in December 2001. At the end of 2002, the Report of the Royal Commission was imminent. No directors had yet landed in prison, but their reputations had been ruined.</p>
         
         <p>The Australian economy performed well throughout the year – better (so we are told) than the economy of any comparable country. My perception is that we have been told the truth about that – though New Zealand seems to me to have performed relatively better than Australia. Against that, however, there was a negative that could not be blamed on any government.</p>
         
         <p>If 1901 and 2001 were parallel years (federation and the centenary of federation) so too were 1902 and 2002. They were the two worst years for drought since European settlement. It will probably rain come mid‐2003, just as the earlier ‘worst drought ever’ broke in mid‐1903. The main thing we can say now is that the 1902 drought was a national calamity. In those days, however, farm produce normally accounted for about 25 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). These days, farm produce accounts for about 3 per cent of GDP. It is expected that the drought will reduce the GDP for 2002 by about 1 per cent. The plight of the sorely affected rural community has been a calamity for them, but not for this urbanised nation as a whole.</p>
