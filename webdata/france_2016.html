         <p>The year 2016 was dominated by the approaching presidential and legislative elections to be held between the end of April and June 2017. The designation of candidates to the presidential election and the organisation of primary elections by the political parties featured prominently on the political agenda. After major terrorist attacks in Nice, issues related to security and the state of emergency continued to overshadow and polarise political debates on refugees and the place of religious signs in the public space. Government reforms liberalising the labour market legislation spurred intense social movements and led to further division among the left.</p>

         <p>A number of changes occurred during 2016 in the composition of the Valls II cabinet, which was in power since August 2014. On 26 January, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira resigned over ‘a major political disagreement’ (<i>Le Monde</i>, 28 January <span title=""><a href="#epdy12181-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12181-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>) on the constitutional reform project to strip French nationality from dual citizens convicted of terrorism, and was replaced by Socialist MP Jean‐Jacques Urvoas. On 11 February, President Hollande announced a cabinet reshuffle to give new impetus to the governmental action and expand his majority's political base. Changes included the appointment of Emmanuelle Cosse, National Secretary of the Green party, as Minister of Housing and the replacement of Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius, who was named President of the Constitutional Council, by former Prime Minister Jean‐Marc Ayrault. The run‐up to the presidential elections led to the resignation of two leading figures of the government: Emmanuel Macron, Minister of the Economy and Industry, left the government on 30 August to launch his presidential campaign around his newly created political movement ‘<i>En marche!</i>’. Three months later, on 6 December, Prime Minister Manuel Valls resigned after announcing his bid to win the Socialist Party's primaries for the candidacy of the Presidential election. He was replaced by Bernard Cazeneuve, former Minister of the Interior.

         <p>There were no major parliamentary changes during 2016 in France. The secession of the Green Party <i>Europe Ecology les Verts</i> (EELV) over whether to pursue cooperation with the Socialist government in 2015 (Faucher and Garcia <span title=""><a href="#epdy12181-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12181-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>) led to the dissolution of the Ecologist parliamentary group in May 2016. With the four deputies of the newly created <i>Parti Ecologiste</i> (PE) joining the Socialist government's majority group, the eleven remaining MPs of EELV continued without a group.

         <p>Having lost both the regional and local elections in 2015, the <i>Socialist Party</i> (PS) was looking forward to a year of reconstruction in 2016. However, such hopes proved short lived as the party was torn by President Hollande's constitutional reform proposal, which included stripping convicted terrorists of their French nationality, and by the labour legislation reform. The government imposed discipline on its MPs, thus triggering extra‐parliamentary rebellions and further weakening the president's popularity. Frictions within the government, and between the government and the party, were exacerbated by Hollande's reluctance to announce his intention to stand for a second mandate. In April Emmanuel Macron, Minister of Economy and Finance, launched his own political movement, ‘<i>En marche!</i>’. A couple of months later, the executive of the PS announced it would organise open primaries for the selection of its candidate. Four small left‐wing organisations (<i>Union des démocrates et des écologistes</i>, the <i>Parti Ecologiste</i>, the <i>Parti radical de gauche</i> and the <i>Front Démocrate</i>) later joined the primary of the left. The date picked (January 2017) was chosen to maximise the chances of the incumbent president, who exhibited strikingly low popularity rates in the eye of poor economic results and persistently high rates of unemployment. Hollande's position was further weakened in November when Macron announced his intention to stand in the presidential election, against the candidate designated by the PS and its allies. The publication of a book containing Hollande's five years of confidences to journalists proved to be the last straw for many of his until then loyal supporters (Davet and Lhomme <span title=""><a href="#epdy12181-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12181-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>): on 1 December, Hollande announced his decision not to be a candidate. A few days later, Manuel Valls resigned from his position as prime minister and announced his candidacy in the primary election.
         </p>
         
         <p>For the main opposition party <i>The Republicans</i> (LR) the year was dominated by the organisation of the first ever primary election of the parties of the right and of the centre, held in November 2016. This new selection process following the successful example of the socialists in 2011 was introduced by the 2015 party constitution. As the party had been bitterly divided after the 2012 presidential defeat, primaries aimed at ensuring the uncontested legitimacy of the winner and at capitalising on the public attention linked to the campaign. The unpopularity of the socialist president and of his government meant that the LR candidate would stand a particular high chance of winning the presidential election. As a consequence, the competition was fierce.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nicolas Sarkozy resigned his position of president of <i>The Republicans</i> on 23 August in order to run as one of the candidates in the primary election. The seven candidates who fulfilled the conditions to compete were announced on 21 September. Six were members of LR: Nicolas Sarkozy (former President 2007–2012), Alain Juppé (Prime Minister 1995–1997), François Fillon (Prime Minister 2007–2012), Nathalie Kosciusko‐Morizet (Minister of Environment and Transport 2010–2012), Bruno Le Maire (Minister of Agriculture 2009–2012), Jean‐François Copé (leader of the party 2012–2014). Jean‐Frédéric Poisson (leader of the <i>Parti Chrétien Démocrate</i>) also ran. Most of the campaign focused on the duel between the polarising figures of Sarkozy and Juppé, the latter receiving the support of centrists. Pollsters failed to predict the rise of Fillon as the third man, and eventual winner. The two ballots of the primaries were held 20 and 27 November and open to any registered French voter who would pay two euros (per ballot) and sign a commitment to republican values. Participation was higher than anticipated: over eight million ballots were cast overall. Fillon won against Juppé in the second round with 66 per cent of the votes.
         </p>
         
         <p>The green party <i>Europe Ecologie Les Verts</i> (EELV) faced another chaotic year after the 2015 secession. In February, Emmanuelle Cosse, National Secretary of EELV, took up a ministerial portfolio in the Valls II government against the party's advice. After resigning from her position in the party she joined the rival organisation ‘<i>Parti Ecologiste</i>’ founded in August 2015. Nevertheless, EELV decided to organise an open primary to select a green candidate for the presidential election rather than support the candidate of another party of the left. All four candidates admitted to compete were established green politicians (three MEPs and one MP). The ballot was open to all French residents aged 16 and above and contributing five euro to the costs of the two ballots. Differences between the programmes of the candidates were slim but to pundits’ dismay the favourite, Cécile Duflot (former party leader and former Minister 2012–2014) was eliminated in the first round. Yannick Jadot won against Michèle Rivasi in the second round with 54 per cent of the votes (EELV, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12181-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12181-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).

         <p>After the adoption of reforms reorganising subnational government in December 2015, the merger of several regions, reducing their number from 22 to 13, was implemented in January 2016. In September 2016, the 13 new regional capitals were named.</p>
         
         <p>The state of emergency declared after the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris was extended on several occasions in 2016: in May, then in July following the attacks in Nice and lastly in December until after the 2017 presidential election. The state of emergency which grants extraordinary powers including facilities to stop and search, search homes and put individuals under house arrests was repeatedly criticised for abuse by human rights organisations.</p>
         
         <p>The president had announced in November 2015 his intention to reform the constitution to give a legal framework to the extended use of the state of emergency and enshrine the possibility of withdrawing French nationality from convicted bi‐national terrorists. Although the latter measure received quiet support in public opinion surveys (and was demanded by the right), the debate on the question became extremely fraught on the left. The president decided to withdraw this particular amendment but failed to convince the parliamentary right to support a reform limited to a single measure. As a consequence, the president chose not to convene the congress (a rare meeting of both chambers in Versailles) and thus abandoning the reform altogether.</p>

         <p>Terrorism featured prominently on the French political agenda for the second year running. After two failed plots in January, three deadly attacks were perpetrated during the summer. Two police officers were attacked in their homes on 13 June in Magnanville and a priest was murdered during mass in Saint‐Etienne‐du‐Rouvray on 26 July. The deadliest attack took place during the 14 July fireworks display in Nice: a heavy‐duty lorry drove through the assembled crowd, killing 86 people and injuring 286 more. It appeared that the nature of the risk changed, combining foreign as well as home‐grown threats, young males but also, now, women and youngsters. The climate of fear and anxiety was dramatically politicised in 2016, breaking with the support the government had received from the opposition the previous year. Controversy was stirred by the local government in Nice, which complained that the national police forces had failed in their duties to protect the population. Although their accusations proved to be unfounded, they contributed to deteriorate the atmosphere to the extent that the prime minister was booed after the minute of silence held in Nice in homage to the victims (18 July). Moreover, moral panic spread during the summer, focused on Islam and incensed in some cases by the visible presence of Muslims in the public space (usually women wearing a veil or fully clothed on the beach). Thirty mayors argued that the presence of fully‐dressed women was a public sign of religious affiliation and adopted edicts banning ‘burkini’ (burqa rather than bikini), based on an interpretation of the 2010 legislation banning the covering of one's face in the public space. The controversy grew until the Conseil d'Etat ruled such bans contravened the mayors’ duty to protect civil liberties, including freedom of expression and freedom of religion (Conseil d'Etat, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12181-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12181-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The continent‐wide migration crisis that had amplified in 2015 also influenced the political news in 2016. Whilst the French government showed reluctance to publicly accept more refugees, the Prime Minister publicly criticised the German Chancellor's policy (in April) as unsustainable in the context of slow economic growth. As a consequence, although the number of refugee visas ‘status granted’ increased by 35 per cent, the overall number of refugees rose to the modest peak of about 30,000 (Ministry of Interior <span title=""><a href="#epdy12181-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12181-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>). In the context of high terrorist risk, the question of migration and refugees remained particularly sensitive. The living conditions of refugees in the illegal camp near Calais (also known as ‘the Jungle’) set up by migrants seeking to reach the United Kingdom deteriorated further with overcrowding. The camp was evacuated partially in March but expanded again in August. The population of ‘the Jungle’ reached 7,000 people, including 1,900 minors, when it was eventually forcibly dismantled in October. Five thousand migrants awaiting administrative decisions were relocated through France. To stop migrants from getting access to the channel tunnel, the British government agreed to fund a four metre high and one kilometre long wall. Construction works were completed in December.
         </p>
         
         <p>The political agenda also included several social movements directly related to public policies and governmental action. Parliamentary debates relating to the new labour market legislation took place in the context of mobilisation: trade unions called for a total of 14 days of strike; demonstrations and general assembly meetings were held at night. The movement called itself <i>Nuit debout</i> (rise up at night) and was inspired by Occupy and <i>Indignados</i>. The El Khomri Law, adopted on 9 March and promulgated in September, contributed to increase the rift between the government and large sections of the popular left. It exposed deep divisions with the socialist party. A number of local socialist party and MPs’ offices were attacked and demonstrators chanted ‘everybody hates the PS’.
         </p>
         
         <p>The government also faced contestation linked to inherent contradictions between environmental commitments and policy implementation. Chief among these were large public infrastructure developments such as the building of a new airport in Notre‐Dame‐des‐Landes near Nantes. In order to escape the stalemate between developers, the police and protesters, the Environment ministry granted the organisation of a local referendum. Although the development was approved by the referendum in June, this hardly calmed down the mobilisation.</p>
