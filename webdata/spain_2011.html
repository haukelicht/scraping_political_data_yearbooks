         <p>During 2011, the economic crisis monopolised the political agenda. The effects of the recession, particularly devastating in some European economies, not only rocked the financial system, but the very stability of the euro. Spain did not remain unaffected by this economic debacle. As a consequence, President Zapatero called for elections before the end of the term of the legislature, at the end of 2011. This was mainly due to the results of local and regional elections held just before the summer. Moreover, throughout the year the political scene was affected by the economic problems which overshadowed any political decision taken by government.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy32-sec-0003"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy32-sec-0003-title"> Local and regional election results</h2>
         
         <p>In the midst of a deep economic crisis at the end of March, the national government called for local elections on 22 May. The turnout in those elections was 3 per cent more than in the previous ones and reached 66 per cent – nearly the same percentage as those held in 2003. This year local elections presented a clear innovation in terms of parties' support. The Popular Party (PP) obtained two million votes more than the Socialist Party, reproducing the distribution of votes of the 1995 local elections (a year after the general election was won for the first time by President Aznar). In aggregated terms, the local party system was almost similar to the former elections at the national level except for the presence of a new party, Unión Progreso y Democracia (UPyD), whose leader Rosa Díez was a former Member of the European Parliament who split from the Socialist Party. UPyD obtained 500,000 votes at national level. It can also be highlighted that in the Basque Country, a new coalition linked to the political arm of the Basque terrorist group ETA, obtained more than 300,000 votes in that region, and more than 1,000 councillors. In terms of councillors, the PP obtained 39 per cent of the 68,000 councillors nationwide, which was 5,000 more than the Socialist Party (PSOE).</p>
         
         <p>According to the political and electoral rules, the presidents of the majority of Spanish regional governments (13 out of 17), called elections for their eight regional parliaments on the same day as the local ones. In fact, all the regional presidents are allowed to call for new elections in between the four years of the legislative period, but the new legislature will be shorter. This was the case of the president of the Asturias region, who called for new elections in March 2012 because he could build enough parliamentary support to approve the regional budget. Turnout in the regional elections ranged from 74–76 per cent in two regions where, for the first time, the Popular Party beat the Socialist Party with 60 per cent of the vote in the Baleares.</p>
         
         <p>In the remaining regions, the levels of turnout were similar to the local ones because a small percentage of electors split their ticket votes. The historic party system in most of these regions is comprised of a two‐party system (i.e., in both Castillas, Cantabria, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia, Comunidad Valenciana and Extremadura) or a multiparty system (i.e., Aragón, Baleares, Canarias and Navarra). This party system design has remained stable although these regional elections introduced several changes. Asturias, which was previously included in the two‐party system group, must be moved to the multiparty system group, mainly because a new political party (Foro Asturias) split from the PP and came second in terms of votes and first in terms of seats. This allowed its leader, Francisco Álvarez Cascos, former vice‐president and minister of government with President Aznar, to become president of a minority government.</p>
         
         <p>Another consequence of this election was that the PP became the first party in terms of votes, seats and governments in all regions except two – Asturias and Navarra, where right‐wing regionalist parties won and its leader became presidents. Canarias is the third region where the PP does not govern, although it won in terms of votes and seats. A right‐wing regional party, called Coalición Canaria, built up a coalition government with the Socialist Party. Since June 2011, the PP has governed in 11 regions that represented 65 per cent of the total. This political scenario that appeared after the results of the regional and local elections is quite similar to what happened in 1995: the results of both subnational elections foretold a change of government due to the victory of the PP in the national government after 14 years of socialist governments.</p>

         <p>President Zapatero took another peculiar and unprecedented political decision during the year. He announced in August that he was going to convoke legislative elections for 20 November and confirmed that would not be seeking his own re‐election. A month later he passed a decree that dissolved the legislature several months before the end of its four‐year legal term. In the middle of an unstable economic scenario (see below), the Socialist Party also suffered an internal crisis because there were two candidates to succeed President Zapatero as candidate for the presidency of the Spanish government. The Socialist Party resolved this in a political conference held some days before the formal electoral call. Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, a former minister of President Gonzalez's cabinet who also became Vice‐president with President Zapatero, was elected to became the Socialist candidate for the elections. He defeated Carme Chacón, the Minister of Defence and leader of the Socialist Catalán Party. This internal Socialist debate and the economic situation contributed to the party's steep decline in results. In fact, during the pre‐electoral campaign all the electoral surveys announced the clear victory of the PP.</p>
         
         <p>On Sunday 20 November the first electoral results showed the clear victory of PP in terms of votes and seats. The electoral turnout was 69 per cent, three points lower than the two former legislative elections in a very competitive scenario between both biggest parties. The PP won with 44 per cent of votes against 28 per cent for the Socialists. The Socialist Party obtained only seven million votes compared to the eleven million votes received in the previous national election held in 2008. In contrast, the PP only received 600,000 more votes than in the aforementioned elections. In fact the PP won in almost all 50 of the Spanish provinces, except for six: Barcelona and Sevilla, where the PSOE won; two other Catalan provinces, where the centre right‐wing nationalist party CiU won; and two Basque provinces where two nationalist parties won: the centre‐right wing nationalist party (PNV) in Vizcaya, and the new political coalition linked to ETA called ‘<i>Bildu</i>’ in Guipúzcoa province. The PP won with 53 per cent of the seats in the lower house, the Congreso de Diputados, and with 64 per cent in the upper house, the Senado. According to the parliamentary rules, the PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, was elected President of the Spanish government at the end of December and formed his first government.

         <p>As the year 2011 has unfolded, the Spanish economy has progressively weakened following the subdued recovery on which it had embarked in 2010. In the labour market, monthly indicators showed over the year an intensification of job losses. Specifically, social security registrations declined with respect to the same period a year earlier. At the same time, new hires registered at the National Public Employment Service were very slack. This slowdown was a consequence of the reduced buoyancy of temporary contracts in the summer of 2011 and the intensification of the decline in permanent contracts, driven in this period by a contraction in conversions, following the growth observed since the end of 2010. The weight of permanent contracts in total hiring fell more than one percentage point from its level a year earlier. The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) figures show a year‐on‐year decline in employment of 2.1 per cent. With the exception of industry, the year‐on‐year performance of all sectors was worse than the previous year, with a notable decline in services employment. This deterioration took place both in market services, where the employment creation was interrupted, and in non‐market activities. The intensification of the fall in employment occurred both among the self‐employed and especially among dependent employees. As a consequence, the total number of persons unemployed rose sharply. At the end of the year the rate of growth of unemployment was more than 21.5 per cent of the labour force.</p>
         
         <p>Financial developments in the Spanish economy were marked by the heightening of tensions on the international financial markets. These tensions were reflected in further increases in yield spreads on eurozone government securities, which reached record highs since the creation of the euro, and extended to other markets and geographical areas. Thus, in Spain, the credit risk premiums on debt securities issued by both public and private sectors increased, stock market indices fell significantly and banks found it more difficult to obtain wholesale funding.</p>
         
         <p>The deterioration in the economic and financial situation worldwide as a result of the deepening sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the worsening growth outlook globally also spread to Spain. The worsening of the sovereign debt crisis ramped up financial tensions, which took the form of an increase in credit risk premiums on both general government and private sector fixed‐income securities issues, declines in stock market indices and growing difficulties for banks in obtaining funds on wholesale markets. The renewed tensions on European sovereign debt markets led to the reactivation of the securities market programme by the European Central Bank. This action, together with the economic policy measures adopted by the Spanish government, allowed the yields on Spanish ten‐year bonds to stabilise, albeit against a background of high volatility.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the agreements reached at the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 21 July and progress in the financial assistance programmes in Ireland and Portugal, the instability in the eurozone's sovereign debt markets continued over the summer months. In August the tensions passed through to larger economies, such as Spain. In turn, the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission came to a final agreement on 11 September concerning the reform of governance. This marks a significant step towards reinforcing the framework for the monitoring and correction of macroeconomic imbalances – a much‐needed step to minimise the risk of future crises. Finally, the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the eurozone countries in late October has seen significant headway in the design of a sufficiently comprehensive strategy to restore and reinforce the financial stability of the area. Although certain specific details have still to be resolved, the agreement addresses the main weaknesses detected and provides for ambitious measures. One of them was a plan aimed at restoring confidence in the banking system using, on the one hand, an EU‐coordinated programme of guarantees to provide financing for the sector and, on the other, a recapitalisation of the main bank. Governments also renewed their commitment to continue adopting the measures needed to ensure the sustainability of their public finances and to boost economic growth, observing the approved fiscal targets and pushing through structural reforms. Since then, the Member States, for their part, approved new adjustment measures in August, September and October.</p>
         
         <p>In Spain, a reform of the Constitution was approved, setting limits on the general government structural deficit and on the public debt ratio in line with the provisions of the Treaty on the European Union. This measure legally enshrines the obligation for all tiers of government to adjust their conduct to the principle of budgetary stability, which is particularly appropriate given the high degree of fiscal decentralisation in place. Although this reform will only come into force in relation to the budget deficit and public debt targets in 2020, it does unquestionably reinforce the principle of budgetary stability. In addition, so as to restrict the risks of deviations from budgetary targets, a new fiscal adjustment package was adopted, with an estimated reducing effect on the budget deficit of 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011. Regarding the labour market, changes were made to the regulation of training contracts and some of the restrictions on temporary hires were lifted.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy32-sec-0006"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy32-sec-0006-title"> Constitutional reform</h2>
         
         <p>Against this background, it has been decided to strengthen the budgetary framework in Spain by building into the constitutional text the limits on the budget deficit and the public debt ratio established at the European level, extending them to all government levels. The raising of these limits to constitutional rank should give rise to a greater degree of compliance with such limits, insofar as the latter would be more difficult to alter and the other laws approved should be compatible with them. The two main parliamentary parties (PSOE and PP) jointly presented a proposed amendment of Article 135 requesting its submission to the emergency procedure of the parliament. Both parties reached this agreement in mid‐September.</p>
         
         <p>Spain already had budgetary stability legislation (BSL) setting limits on the deficit that all tiers of government may incur. Nonetheless, it has been decided to reinforce this framework further, leading to the approval in September 2011 of a reform of the constitution that incorporates the deficit and debt limits set at European level. Previously, in July 2011, a public spending growth rule was introduced for central government and for the biggest municipal councils. Under this rule, the rate of increase of public spending may not annually exceed the economy's nominal medium‐term growth rate. Along the same lines, the Euro Plus Pact, signed in April 2011 by the eurozone Heads of State and Government to strengthen economic policy coordination in favour of competitiveness and convergence, highlights as one of its essential objectives the need for the Member States to transpose the EU budgetary rules laid down in the Security and Growth Pact into national legislation. In this respect, it is stressed that, although the Member States may select the specific national legal instrument used to bring about this transposition, they must ensure this instrument is sufficiently and soundly binding and durable (e.g., a constitutional or framework law). The exact formulation of the rule will also be decided by each country, although budgetary discipline must be ensured both at the national level and at other regional and local levels. It is in this connection that the recent reform of the budgetary framework in Spain is being undertaken. In fact, the national budgetary framework has been defined since 2001 by the BSL, which was subsequently amended in 2006. This legislation sets limits on the deficit that all levels of government may incur. Likewise, it details a procedure for setting and monitoring targets, along with the consequences, if any, in the event of noncompliance. The reforms approved in 2011 reinforce this framework with the incorporation of the fiscal limits into the Spanish Constitution, along with the introduction of a public spending rule linked to medium‐term economic growth.</p>
         
         <p>The reform enshrines in the constitution the obligation for all levels of government to adjust their conduct to the principle of budgetary stability. Specifically, it establishes that the state and regional governments may not incur a structural deficit that exceeds the margins, if any, established by the European Union. Local governments, for their part, must keep their budget in balance. In the case of public debt, its weight in relation to GDP may not exceed the reference value established in the Treaty on European Union, and absolute priority is granted to the payment of interest charges and of principal on public debt over other budgetary commitments. The limits on the structural deficit and the volume of public debt may only be exceeded in the event of natural disasters, economic recession or exceptional emergency situations beyond the control of the state and which considerably impair the financial situation or the economic or social sustainability of the state. An absolute majority in parliament would be required in this situation. As for the mechanisms for encouraging or forcing through compliance, the constitutional reform indicates that the implementing organic law should regulate the responsibility of each government level in the event of noncompliance with the budgetary stability targets, which might be interpreted as the possibility of including sanctions. Sanctions are, in fact, a mechanism that could encourage compliance.</p>
