         <p>Superficially, 2015 was a major year in New Zealand politics, with a number of contentious scandals and notable events. But most of this can be viewed in terms of Shakespeare's ʻsound and fury’, meaning that in the end most of the dramatic and colourful events were not very meaningful or significant in changing New Zealand politics. For example, the government and Prime Minister were beset by a number of setbacks and embarrassing issues, but their high levels of popularity remained largely intact.</p>

            <p>In late 2015, New Zealanders began deciding whether to change the national flag via a two‐step referendum process. The first of the two referendums was to choose an alternative flag that could be pitted against the <i>status quo</i> in 2016. The origin of the referendum process lay in a longstanding debate on whether New Zealand's flag needed changing. There has never been a clear sign of significant public desire for change, but Prime Minister John Key promised a referendum on the issue in the lead up to the 2014 general election. After the election, his government devised a process by which a Flag Consideration Panel would come up with four alternative flags to put to a referendum vote to see which one should compete against the <i>status quo</i> in a final decision on whether to change. Four flags were chosen, three of which featured variations of the indigenous silver fern. Later, a fifth flag named ʻRed Peakʼ was added to the official options after a grassroots campaign used social media to demand its inclusion. The postal ballot referendum did not create strong enthusiasm for the issue, achieving a turnout of about 45 per cent. The winning flag in this first round was one that contained a silver fern, a constellation of stars (ʻthe Southern Crossʼ) and a blue and black background. Preferential voting was used, allowing voters to rank the five flags in order of preference. The winning flag won on the fourth round of the counting of preference votes, gaining 50.6 per cent, compared to the runner‐up – which had the same designer, and was very similar – which won 49.4 per cent.

         <p>The government was relatively stable throughout 2015. Prime Minister John Key carried out a reshuffle in December, in which former minister Judith Collins was reinstated to cabinet as Minister for Corrections and Police. The rearrangement was termed a ʻminor surgicalʼ reshuffle by the Prime Minister who also dealt with ministers who were deemed to be performing poorly in their portfolios. Most notably, the Minister of Corrections, Sam Lotu‐Iiga, was stripped of his portfolio and demoted. Likewise, Police Minister Michael Woodhouse lost his portfolio.</p>
         
         <p>Collins picked up the portfolios of both Corrections and Police in her return to cabinet. This was a significant development because she had resigned from cabinet in the weeks leading up to the general election in the previous year. Her departure occurred under a cloud of suspicion and followed on from a number of controversies and scandals (Edwards <span><a href="#epdy12140-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12140-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>: 227). The scandal in which she was implicated was later investigated, leading to some degree of exoneration, which paved the way for her to return to cabinet. But as a controversial and polarising politician there was plenty of speculation about her political future – including leadership ambitions – and whether her colleagues wanted her to return or not.
         </p>
         
         <p>The other major change in the cabinet reshuffle was the departure of the Minister of Trade and Minister for Climate Change Issues, Tim Groser, who resigned from parliament on 19 December to take up the role of New Zealandʼs ambassador to the United States of America.</p>
         
         <p>The National Party (NP) is technically a single‐party minority government as it won 60 of the 121 seats at the 2014 election. The cabinet is made up of 20 NP ministers. However, the party also has an agreement with the Maori, United Future and Act parties to provide support for it to remain in government. In exchange, all those parties have ministerial warrants within the executive, but outside of cabinet. After the 2014 election, this gave NP 64 votes – a clear parliamentary majority. However, in March, the party lost a seat in a by‐election to Winston Peters, the leader of the New Zealand First (NZF) party. Since Peters was already a list MP, the victory allowed his party to bring an additional list MP (Rita Bond) to parliament. Conversely, it meant that the ruling NP had one less MP, reducing their total from 60 to 59 out of 121 seats in parliament. This meant that the government's ability to pass legislation was brought into question.</p>

         <p>The year's biggest disruption to parliament was a by‐election in the NP‐held seat of Northland, which occurred in March after the surprise resignation of MP Mike Sabin. This resignation was controversial, as the circumstances behind it have never been revealed to the public and continuing legal proceedings still prevent this. Despite this controversy, the ruling NP was not expecting to lose what was a very safe seat. Instead, the by‐election was won by Winston Peters, the leader of the minor NZF party. The maverick politician managed to win the seat with a majority of over 4,000 votes, overturning the previous NP majority of over 9,000 votes. Peters’ by‐election win was an astonishing victory. It appeared to rejuvenate the party somewhat, and it increased speculation about its political direction, with suggestions that NZF might seek to capitalise on the win of a provincial seat and become more focused on provincial votes. But others pointed to the failure of Peters and the party to achieve anything else during the year.</p>
         
         <p>Two other departures from parliament occurred during the year. The co‐leader of the Green Party, Russel Norman, announced in January that he would be stepping down as co‐leader, and then subsequently decided to also leave parliament in October. He was replaced by the next person on the party list (Marama Davidson). Another list MP, Tim Groser, also a cabinet minister, resigned from parliament in December. He left to become New Zealandʼs ambassador to the United States of America. He was replaced by Maureen Pugh who was next on the party list.</p>
         
         <p>Debate in Parliament got increasingly heated throughout the year, culminating in a walkout from the debating chamber of a large number of opposition women MPs. This occurred in December during a debate about New Zealand citizens who were being deported and detained in Australia. The walk out was in response to the Prime Minister claiming his parliamentary opponents were supporting ʻmurders and rapistsʼ. The women argued that he was devaluing violence against women.</p>

         <p>There were no major institutional changes in New Zealand politics during 2015. There was, however, a major change in leadership for the Green Party. The resignation of Russel Norman, who had been the male co‐leader of the party since 2006, triggered a race to replace him, which was eventually won by first‐term MP James Shaw. Shaw saw off two much longer‐serving Green MPs for the job, which was considered surprising. But his victory was largely attributed to better communication skills and the perception that he would more easily win over new voters for the party. With a background in business consultancy, Shaw was perceived as being a more moderate and mainstream option.</p>

         <p>There were plenty of scandals and spectacles in New Zealand politics during 2015 – all of varying importance. The strangest was Prime Minister John Key pulling a café worker's ponytail. News that the head of the government had been regularly pulling on the woman's hair created a stir, and was reported internationally, after she spoke out via a left‐wing blog. It was not the only time the Prime Minister faced criticism for his personal behaviour. Key became increasingly casual in his involvement in breakfast radio station interviews and banter. His participation in a number of unorthodox interviews and stunts on radio stations was widely regarded as embarrassing.</p>
         
         <p>Other scandals of a less sensational nature also occurred around the probity of government dealings with private interests. The most interesting was the uncovering of a deal undertaken a number of years prior with a Saudi Arabian investor who had been aggrieved by New Zealand changing the law about the export of live sheep. The investor had been compensated via a number of unorthodox joint‐operations, involving the establishment of a sheep farm in Saudi Arabia. Critics accused the government of bribery and corruption, and the Auditor General launched an investigation, which is yet to report.</p>
         
         <p>The management of prisons was a hot topic, with a strong focus on how private provider, Serco, was managing prisoners and violence. A strong campaign by Labour MP Kelvin Davis brought attention to mismanagement, and the minister in charge, Sam Lotu‐liga, was eventually fired from the portfolio.</p>
         
         <p>More substantial debate occurred on economic matters, and especially on the increasing unaffordability of housing. This was most notable in the city of Auckland, where house prices had increased significantly in recent years. All political parties focused on this issue, but it was the opposition Labour Party that was the most controversial, launching a campaign that blamed Chinese investors for the problem. The party was accused of racism by opponents.</p>
