         <p>During the year 2007 the Italian party system underwent a series of changes. The most relevant was the establishment of the Partito Democratico or Pd (Democratic Party), which was formed by the merger of two former centre‐left parties: the social‐democrat Democratici di Sinistra or Ds (Left Democrats) and the moderately progressive confessional La Margherita (the Daisy). Both parties represented the bulk of the Prodi Government coalition L'Unione (the Union) after the 2006 general elections. The process leading to the formation of the new party has been long, tormented and even painful – and it dates back to 2003 (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ignazi 2004</a></span>). The dénouement of this process came with the dramatic victory at the 2006 election, and in April 2007 both parties (Ds and the Daisy) celebrated congresses for closing down the previous organisations. There were, however, some important differences: while the Daisy managed its passage into the new formation quite smoothly (only a handful of aged, former Christian Democratic members objected that the confessional dimension of the party was at risk), the Ds got trapped in a series of profound disputes and, right at the end, its left‐wing component abandoned the party.
         </p>
         
         <p>Eventually, at the end of April, the Ds (with more than 75 per cent of party members approving) and the Daisy (with near unanimity) shut down their own parties and nominated a committee to oversee the transition to the new party. The committee had to prepare what amounted to an ideological charter and rules for the election of the leader and of the national bodies. As a result, the leader had to be elected via an open, nationwide primary, where all citizens willing to participate had to donate a small amount of money and sign the declaration of principles. Contrary to all expectations, the election held on October 14 attracted more than 3.5 million people and selected the Ds mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni, who won with 75.4 per cent of the votes. After a couple of weeks, a large constituent assembly (made of 2,400 members) was elected. Although Mr Veltroni – seen as a dynamic moderniser – was well received by the press and within both parties' rank‐and‐file, many criticisms were made of the limited renovation and turnover of the local leaderships and of the constituent assembly itself.</p>
         
         <p>This important novelty in the Italian party system produced an imitative effect by the centre‐left's right‐wing counterpart. A few weeks after the election of Veltroni and thus the formal start of the Pd, the leader of the main opposition party, Forza Italia or FI (Go Italy!), Silvio Berlusconi, announced his intention to set up a new, unitary, centre‐right party, open to all who were ‘moderate’ and ‘passionate about liberty’. The other partners of the right‐wing coalition, Alleanza Nazionale or AN (National Alliance), Lega Nord or LN (Northern League) and Unione Democratica di Centro or UDC (Centre Democratic Union), reacted very coldly. The leader of AN, Gianfranco Fini, in particular, wrote a letter to the newspaper <i>Corriere della Sera</i> where, criticising the proposal, he for the first time openly questioned Berlusconi's leadership of the centre‐right opposition. The final, minor, change in the party system was offered by the split of the AN's radical component, led by the former Ministry of Health Francesco Storace, who founded a new party, La Destra (The Right). Few AN members followed him into the splinter group.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Prodi Government continued its policy focused on fostering economic growth and reducing the public debt, and achieved amazing success. The growth rate was the highest of the decade, and the GNP/debt ratio returned to well below the 3 per cent threshold. These results were facilitated by a very tough policy against tax fraud and evasion (which produced a huge increase in state revenues) and by clamping down on wages and state spending. Both policies, however, produced a reaction. On one side, the Vice‐Ministry of Finance Mr Vincenzo Visco was the constant target of the centre‐right's polemic and was involved in a long quarrel with the chief general Guardia di Finanza (Finance Guard), accused of inefficiency by the Vice‐Ministry. On the other side, the radical left within the government (in particular, Rifondazione Comunista or RC (Communist Refoundation)) repeatedly expressed its uneasiness with the government's ‘unpopular’ socio‐economic policy.</p>
         
         <p>Other issues produced divisions within the government. Foreign policy, and in particular the Italian commitment to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan, was a continuous source of conflict between the radical‐left and the other governmental parties. Indeed, it was on this issue that the government was defeated in the Senate (where it had only a tiny majority) when a couple of radical‐left senators refused to support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This vote produced the resignation of the Prodi Government on 21 February; however, the President of the Republic sent back the same government to the parliament for a formal vote of confidence – which the government then won in both chambers on 28 February. The two radical‐left Senators were expelled by their own party.</p>
         
         <p>Another conflict saw the Catholic component of the majority, concentrated in the Daisy, square up to the secular parties. The <i>casus belli</i> was provided by a proposal on civic same‐sex unions. In order to achieve an agreement, the government presented a series of different proposals, but the reaction of the Church, of the centre‐right opposition and of the Catholic component of the government majority caused the defeat of all the proposals. Moreover, in order to defend the ‘family’, a network of Catholic organisations (discreetly supported by the Church) held a rally in Rome, which was a remarkable success with hundreds of thousands of participants, including the three leaders of the centre‐right (Berlusconi, Casini and Fini), notwithstanding the fact that all were divorced, unlike all of the leaders of the centre‐left parties, both Catholic and secular.
         </p>
         
         <p>The political year was also characterised by the rise of ‘anti‐political’ sentiment. Two indicators revealed mounting sentiment of dissatisfaction and even alienation vis‐à‐vis the system. The first was the amazing success of a pamphlet (of which more than a million copies were sold) called <i>The Caste</i>, which denounced the privileges of the politicians. The second indicator was the massive participation in multiple rallies organised simultaneously in more than thirty cities on September 8 by a leading showman, Beppe Grillo, protesting against the political class. Both symbolised the public malaise regarding politics, and political parties in particular. The acceleration of the Pd's birth and the counter‐proposal by Mr Berlusconi at the end of year were, <i>inter alia</i>, a tentative answer to this malaise.
