         <p>The tremendous popularity of the ruling National government continued in 2011, culminating in its re‐election at the November general election. In a year where National was faced with significant difficulties – especially economy‐ and earthquake‐related – they managed these reasonably well. In contrast, most other political parties had a particularly difficult year. The government's support partners, the Maori and Act parties, both had significant internal schisms, while the main opposition party, Labour, struggled to reinvent itself and actually ended up losing further support in the election.</p>
         
         <p>The most defining issue of the election campaign was a controversy that became known as the ‘teapot tape’ scandal, in which the Prime Minister was covertly recorded when meeting with a political ally over a cup of tea during a campaign photo opportunity. This issue was embarrassing for the government, which over‐reacted and called in the police. Arguably, the Prime Minister's poor political management of the teapot affair cost his party the chance of a comprehensive election victory and the ability to form a single‐party majority government.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0003"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0003-title"> The National Party government</h2>
         
         <p>The National Party had a relatively successful year, often scoring 50–55 per cent in the polls. Although National did not manage to achieve such high support in the general election, it gained a bigger share of the vote than when elected to government three years earlier. Prime Minister John Key continued to be National's greatest electoral asset, enjoying very high levels of personal popularity. Key's winning formula of portraying himself as an ‘anti‐politician’ largely continued through his first term as Prime Minister.</p>
         
         <p>National and Key's popularity continued despite – or, perhaps, because of – the challenges of government. The difficult economic environment was the overwhelming issue in politics – with New Zealand incurring low growth, significant unemployment and a deteriorating government fiscal situation. The National government continued to respond by implementing spending cuts and welfare‐tightening measures. National claimed to have few other policy options, and its annual budget promised no extra spending. Such measures and negative economic conditions seemed to do the government no harm in terms of public opinion. Austerity economics were accepted as necessary.</p>
         
         <p>Furthermore, National announced at the beginning of the year that it would campaign in the general election on the traditionally unpopular policy of asset sales. It proposed a ‘mixed‐ownership model’ whereby four state‐owned energy companies, as well as the national airline Air New Zealand, would be partially privatised. Shares would be sold on the stock market, with the government promising to retain at least 51 per cent ownership.</p>
         
         <p>The biggest issue of the year for New Zealanders was the February earthquake in Christchurch, which killed 185 people – most of whom died in one building alone. Following on from a magnitude 7.1 earthquake six months earlier, the 2011 earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.3, severely damaged the country's second‐largest city, and was deemed to be one of New Zealand's deadliest peacetime disasters. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the parliament was adjourned for two weeks in order for the cabinet to work on earthquake response. The government also established the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) to coordinate the rebuild. Cabinet Minister Gerry Brownlee had been appointed the Earthquake Recovery Minister following the 2010 quake, and now he focused solely on the earthquake emergency and rebuild. Brownlee's performance was generally deemed to be excellent. The financial cost of the many earthquakes was hard to establish, but the Government's Earthquake Commission expected to pay out about NZ$12 billion. In addition, the total cost to insurance companies has been estimated at NZ$20–30 billion – arguably making it the world's third most costly earthquake.</p>
         
         <p>Another extremely costly event for the government was the decision to bail out the investors in the country's largest locally owned finance company, South Canterbury Finance, at an initial cost of NZ$1.6 billion. The rescue package was activated under the terms of the Retail Deposit Guarantee Scheme – a measure established during the global financial crisis. The pay‐out to all 35,000 investors was particularly controversial as legal processes were later taken against company directors.</p>
         
         <p>Another disaster struck in October when a container ship, the MV Rena, ran aground off the coast of the North Island, near Tauranga. Environment Minister Nick Smith described the grounding and subsequent oil spill as ‘New Zealand's worst environmental disaster’. The Rena disaster was instantly political. However, although politicians rushed to Tauranga, they had to tread the oily beaches with care as there was no great public appetite for over‐politicisation of the incident, and most refrained from using the incident to score political points. The clear political beneficiary was the Green Party.</p>
         
         <p>Another potentially difficult area for the government to navigate was the long‐promised implementation of the new Marine and Coastal Area (TakutaiMoana) Act 2011, which was created to replace the controversial Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 passed by the last Labour government. Again this caused little problem for the government, but the legislation was one of the reasons for a split in its support party, the Maori Party, with MP Hone Harawira choosing to leave the party.</p>
         
         <p>The government also courted controversy in passing the Video Camera Surveillance (Temporary Measures) Act 2011. This legislation was the result of a surprise Supreme Court ruling in September that declared almost all covert video surveillance by police to be unlawful and therefore inadmissible in court. In response, the government pushed through legislation to legalise such surveillance.</p>
         
         <p>For the most part, the government showed an unerring ability to deal adeptly with controversies. One episode that belied this was the decision to renew the fleet of ministerial limousines. The upgrade of luxury cars might have been a relatively sensible financial decision, and in fact was a deal struck under the prior Labour government, but it was a poor political decision in the context of the new austerity measures imposed on other sections of society.</p>
         
         <p>Despite finishing a successful first term of government, a number of senior National Party politicians choose to retire at the election. Most significantly and surprisingly, the widely tipped future leader, Simon Power, announced in March that he would be retiring at the election. This necessitated a cabinet reshuffle, and Power's ministerial portfolio for State‐owned Enterprises was transferred to Tony Ryall. Three other ministers also stood down in 2011: Wayne Mapp, Georgina te Heuheu and John Carter.</p>

         <p>The National government that was elected in 2008 had a working majority in the parliament and governed with senior ministers from three other political parties. Yet technically it was actually a ‘single‐party minority government’. It is increasingly the practice in New Zealand, under proportional representation, for government support parties to hold senior ministerial portfolios but to remain outside of cabinet. Constitutionally, such ministers are part of the executive, but because they are not part of the inner cabinet and because their parties do not guarantee to support all of the government's legislation, they are regarded as ‘support parties’ rather than ‘coalition partners’. National only has the agreement of these support parties to vote in the parliament in favour of confidence motions and on the annual budget, which means that National cannot be certain to pass any other legislation without reaching agreement with some or all of its support parties. There is a large amount of ambiguity about the arrangement, and in general most New Zealanders would probably regard Act, United Future and the Maori Party to be in ‘coalition’ with National.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0005"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0005-title"> Act Party</h2>
         
         <p>The right‐wing Act Party had a peculiar and disastrous year. Pressured by continually low opinion poll results and ongoing uncertainty about its ideological basis, some sort of implosion had been inevitable for some time. The first major problem came with a fight between Act leader Rodney Hide and deputy leader Heather Roy, with the latter losing her position and her ministerial job as a result. The internal fight was indicative of some strong ideological divisions in the party. Roy represented the element that favoured a more purist or principled approach that would emphasise neoliberal economic reform. Hide represented those within Act who wanted the party to be moderate, pragmatic and populist.</p>
         
         <p>A second major battle occurred over the leadership of Act, and was even more extraordinary. Don Brash, who had previously been an MP and leader of the much larger National Party, carried out a coup against leader Rodney Hide, becoming the party's new leader, from outside of the parliament. Brash was not even a member of the party until he challenged Hide for the leadership. He had threatened that if Act did not make him leader, he would launch a rival right‐wing party. However, by the time of the election campaign, the entire parliamentary Act caucus of five MPs had decided not to stand for re‐election.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0006"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0006-title"> Maori and Mana parties</h2>
         
         <p>The Maori Party's participation in the National government was particularly problematic because much of its support base was unsupportive of National. One of its MPs, Hone Harawira, was an especially uncomfortable participant in the arrangement, and was frequently critical of the government. After a long period of internal party negotiations, the inevitable occurred, and Harawira left the Maori Party in February. He also resigned from the parliament, creating a by‐election in his Te Tai Tokerau electorate, which he contested and won, beating off strong challenges from the Labour Party and a weak challenge from the Maori Party. Harawira launched a new party called ‘Mana’. The new party had a distinctly radical and leftist nature, but imbued with a strident Maori nationalism.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0007"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0007-title"> Labour Party</h2>
         
         <p>The Labour Party had a difficult year, and its leader Phil Goff found little success against a very popular Prime Minister. Much of the difficulty related to the party's struggle to rejuvenate and reposition itself after three terms of government and its loss in 2008. It had trouble projecting what it now stood for, and how it differed from the party when it was recently ejected from government.</p>
         
         <p>There were a number of individual MPs who caused problems for Labour's rebuild in 2011. Perhaps the most damaging was a scandal revolving around MP Darren Hughes, after the media reported that the police were investigating complaints against him by an 18 year‐old man that had apparently fled his Wellington home at 3 am. Labour's problem was not so much the actual incident but the way that leader Phil Goff managed it. Goff had decided that he should keep the police investigation secret for several weeks, not even informing the party president. Hughes voluntarily resigned from the parliament, never answering any questions about the affair. There was a consensus that the incident had finished the career of one of Labour's most liked and talented rising stars.</p>
         
         <p>Another thorn in the side of the Labour leadership, MP Damien O'Connor, caused a storm when he spoke out against the party's candidate list ranking exercise. He claimed that Labour was dominated by ‘self‐serving unions and a gaggle of gays’, and announced he would not take a place on the party list. Instead he just stood in the electorate of West Coast‐Tasman, which he won (making him the only Labour MP to win a seat back off National).</p>
         
         <p>At the election, a senior Labour MP, Pete Hodgson, retired. He was joined in retirement by long‐time maverick MP Jim Anderton, who had split with Labour in 1989 and led various left‐of‐Labour parties before being essentially welcomed back into the Labour tent before retiring. His Progressive Party was wound up.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0008"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0008-title"> Green Party</h2>
         
         <p>The Greens appeared to have a major breakthrough in 2011. Originally regarded as outsiders, by 2011 the Greens had metamorphosed into a much more conventional, moderate and professional party. Throughout the 2008–2011 term, the Greens repositioned and rebranded themselves as a party that could appeal to a broader, ‘middle New Zealand’ constituency. They shed much of their radical image, opened the door to cooperation with all parties on the political spectrum and emphasised their economic aptitude. The ‘new and improved’ Green Party's main break from the past was in personnel: none of the seven MPs originally elected in 1999 stood for re‐election.</p>
         
         <p>The new generation of Green politicians was very keen to promote a more respectable image. Business suits and ties became <i>de rigueur</i>. The party also deliberately presented itself as more business‐friendly through a key strategic decision to combat their perceived economic incompetence. This defined the Green's 2011 election campaign. The party's co‐leader and economic spokesperson, Russel Norman, gave numerous interviews and speeches on the future of New Zealand's economy, preaching ‘fiscal conservatism’.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another key part of the Greens' repositioning for 2011 was the party's much‐heralded change of stance on coalitions. At their June party conference, the Greens declared that a post‐election coalition arrangement with the National Party was ‘highly unlikely’ rather than impossible. All of these factors helped the party succeed in repositioning itself as a respectable environmental party with ‘medium‐party status’.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0009"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0009-title"> New Zealand First</h2>
         
         <p>The biggest comeback of the political year came from Winston Peters' New Zealand First party. At the 2008 election they had been knocked out of the parliament after winning only 4 per cent of the vote (short of the 5 per cent mixed‐member proportional representation (MMP) threshold) having been dogged by a funding scandal. In 2011 Winston Peters ran a strong schedule of public meetings throughout the country. He had been discounted by most as having no chance of being resurrected to the parliament, particularly because during his absence he had been virtually invisible within the media and because it is not easy for parties outside of parliament to gain representation.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0010"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0010-title"> The general election</h2>
         
         <p>The general election was held on Saturday, 26 November, but announced uncharacteristically early – in February. Most governments keep the date a closely guarded secret, hoping that this will afford them a tactical advantage. The long build‐up to polling day was interrupted by the Rugby World Cup, which was hosted in New Zealand during September and October. The All Blacks won the Cup, fuelling public contentment, which some observers believed encouraged a vote in favour of the status quo. A total of 13 political parties put forward a party list (in the previous election, 19 parties did so). There were 544 individuals standing for election (down from 682 in 2008). Of these, 380 contested both list and electorate seats, 91 were list‐only and 73 were electorate‐only.</p>
         
         <p>The National government went into the campaign as the clear favourite. Yet National nearly lost its place in government. Partly this was due to the difficulties of its ‘support parties’ Act, United Future and the Maori Party – all of which suffered declines in support. Although National itself was certain to win something near 50 per cent of the seats, it was not entirely clear that it could rely on its support parties being re‐elected and signing up to renewed ‘supply and confidence’ agreements.</p>
         
         <p>In addition, National had a poor campaign. John Key in particular was lacklustre, and for the first time displayed both significant lapses of judgement and a moody temper. This was most obvious in the reaction to what became known as the ‘teapot tape scandal’, when he was covertly recorded during a campaign photo opportunity meeting. The meeting (to which the media were invited) took place in Auckland and was an attempt by National to signal an implicit endorsement of the Act candidate. The Act Party (a coalition partner of National's) was facing electoral defeat at the election unless it could win at least one electorate. National sought to save its coalition partner by sending a message to National voters to vote not for the National candidate but for John Banks, the Act candidate. There was already heightened public and media interest in the issue. But the event, which came two weeks prior to polling day, became more significant when it was revealed that a freelance cameraman, Bradley Ambrose, had covertly recorded the conversation. Ambrose claimed that the audio recording had been made unintentionally.</p>
         
         <p>John Key then laid a complaint with the police, and from this point his relationship with the media became decidedly colder. The police issued search warrants to various media outlets, and carried out an investigation. In the meantime, various details of the recording leaked out, fuelling interest in the New Zealand First Party and its leader Winston Peters, who claimed that the Prime Minister had been recorded making derogatory remarks about his supporters. Many commentators therefore credit the scandal for helping New Zealand First make its successful comeback at the election, and arguably reducing the vote for National.</p>
         
         <p>The next biggest scandal was the revelation that the Green Party was closely linked to a coordinated, nationwide project to deface the National Party's election billboards. The mini‐scandal occurred a few weeks prior to election day, when about 700 opposition billboards were plastered with alternative slogans such as ‘The Rich Deserve More’ and ‘Drill it! Mine it! Sell it!’. When it became apparent that Green co‐leader Russel Norman's own parliamentary secretary was closely connected to the vandalism, Norman acted fast in putting the staffer on leave, issuing a statement condemning the actions, and helping authorities deal with the alleged crime. The Greens even went as far as helping to purchase and erect replacement billboards for their opponents.It was a testament to the Greens' newfound professionalism that the leadership managed to turn what could have been a damaging scandal into a public relations success.</p>
         
         <p>The economy was the focus of all key election debates and the campaign strategies of the major parties. Materialist concerns prevailed in the media – particularly the cost of living and unemployment. New Zealand suffered from the global financial crisis and from the shadow of the European debt crisis. The Christchurch earthquake recovery was also a prominent materialist election issue. The focus on economic issues meant that the 2011 election had a greater left–right dimension than recent campaigns. Post‐materialist issues that had dominated previous campaigns – such as climate change, foreign affairs and race relations – were discussed, but were far from central.</p>
         
         <p>The economy was a particular problem for the Labour opposition. The austerity conditions meant that there was little room to manoeuvre in offering additional spending. Although Labour had criticised National's various spending cuts and restraint, eventually the party came to agree with National's broad goals of reducing the deficit and getting back into surplus. Labour did, however, have some relatively radical policies that sought to combat the austere economic conditions. These included the introduction of a capital gains tax, and a proposal to raise the pension age to 67 years. Phil Goff was judged to have a very good campaign, despite a generally poor performance until then. However, Labour left images of its leader off most campaign hoardings and literature.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy25-sec-0011"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy25-sec-0011-title"> Election results</h2>
         
         <p>The National Party was a big winner in the general election, gaining nearly 47.3 per cent of the party vote – an increase of 2 per cent over its 2008 victory, a clear plurality. This result was the highest that any party had achieved since the introduction of MMP in 1996. However, rather than representing a massive swing to the right, National's vote basically held up while other parties lost much of their vote, especially to non‐voting. National's total vote was 1,058,636, only about 4,000 higher than its 2008 total. The 2011 National vote was also a lower result than the preceding opinion polls had suggested; in the month before the election, National was mostly in the 50–55 per cent range. Crucially, the final result only produced 59 seats for National in the 121‐MP parliament, which was two seats short of a majority.</p>
         
         <p>The next most popular party, Labour, suffered a loss of nearly 7 per cent of the vote, dropping to just 27.5 per cent and losing nine seats (to 34 MPs). The result was the party's lowest since 1928. The Green Party was easily the third biggest party, and gained the biggest proportion of increased vote – up by 4 per cent to 11 per cent, producing 14 MPs. New Zealand won 6.6 per cent, with a surprise return to the parliament after an absence of three years. The Act Party suffered the heaviest loss – being reduced from five MPs to only one: John Banks. Its party vote of barely 1 per cent was less than a third of its previous total. The Maori Party also lost ground, winning only three of the Maori seats (having previously won five) and only 1.4 per cent of the party vote. It lost the seat of Te Tai Tonga to Labour's Rino Tirikatene. Its decline was also partly due to its split, with Mana Party winning Te Tai Tokerau for its leader Hone Harawira, and 1.1 per cent of the party vote. The United Future party also lost some of its vote, declining to 0.6 per cent, but its leader, Peter Dunne, retained his electorate seat of Ohariu. The biggest surprise ‘success’ of the election was the emergence of the Christian‐oriented Conservative Party, which won 2.7 per cent of the vote. Its leader, Colin Craig, also did very well in the seat of Rodney.</p>
         
         <p>Under MMP, changes and performance in electorate seats are less important than the party vote. Nonetheless there were a few significant changes. Two of these took place in Christchurch, where National captured two seats off Labour. That such a traditionally Labour area swung to the National Party was seen as a vote of confidence in the government's response to the earthquakes and the planned rebuild. Overall, the new parliament contained 25 new MPs.</p>
         
         <p>Voter turnout in 2011 was 69.57 per cent – the lowest for over a century. This sparked increased concern and comment about the various causes of voter disenchantment and disinterest. There is no doubt that part of the decline was due to the public's perception that the result was a foregone conclusion. After all, opinion polls in the lead up to polling day showed that National was far ahead of Labour, and might even win enough seats to govern without coalition partners. Yet turnout has been on the decline in New Zealand for some time, and other factors were clearly at play. Some analysts point to the increasing ideological similarities of the parliamentary parties and their often empty posturing and campaigning.</p>

         <p>The incumbent National Party was easily able to form a new government after election day. As in 2008, National quickly negotiated ‘confidence and supply’ agreements with Act, United Future and the Maori Party. Once again, the Key‐led government was technically a ‘single‐party minority government’ with three ‘support parties’ – this time with a seven‐seat majority in the parliament (down from 16). And again the leaders of the three minor parties hold senior ministerial posts but remain outside of cabinet.</p>
         
         <p>The main difference with the 2008 configuration was the change of Act Party personnel. John Banks became the Minister for Small Business and Minister for Regulatory Reform. Because Banks was now the sole Act MP, he took on the leadership of the party, with Don Brash resigning and stating that he took full responsibility for the party's poor performance.</p>
         
         <p>The Labour Party sought to immediately respond to its poor result by finding a new leadership team. At Labour's first post‐election caucus meeting, leader Phil Goff and deputy leader Annette King resigned. This opened the long‐awaited campaign for a new leadership. A fortnight‐long leadership campaign took place, which included a relatively novel series of candidate debates in front of party members. The Labour caucus then elected David Shearer as leader and Grant Robertson as deputy. The selection of Shearer was a relatively surprising choice as he was virtually unknown to the public, having come into the parliament only in 2009 in a by‐election to replace the retiring Helen Clark. For many in the party, his main strength was his freshness and lack of connection to previous Labour governments. He also offered a potential foil to Prime Minister Key's ‘rags to riches’ story (as well as having a similar down‐to‐earth and affable persona).</p>

         <p>Alongside the general election, a referendum was held on the MMP electoral system. First used in the 1996 election, MMP was being evaluated and decided upon for the first time by the public. Voters were asked two questions: Should New Zealand keep the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting system? And, if New Zealand were to change to another voting system, which voting system would you choose? In the first crucial question, a clear majority of 68.9 per cent of voters favoured the retention of MMP. In the second question, where voters could choose their alternative, the results were: First Past the Post, 46.7 per cent; Supplementary Member, 24.1 per cent; Single Transferable Vote, 16.7 per cent; and Preferential Voting, 12.5 per cent. The clear referendum results put an end to campaigns to abolish the MMP system. Instead an inquiry was established to look at ways to improve the electoral system.</p>
