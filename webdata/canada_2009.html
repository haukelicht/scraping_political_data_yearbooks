         <p>As the year began Canadians were marking five‐and‐a‐half years of minority government – the result of three general elections that appeared to have left the political system stalemated. The parliamentarians seemed to have learned little over the life of the three parliaments and showed no capacity to agree on a shared public agenda. Their behaviour suggested that they were simply putting in time until another election would hopefully return the system to ‘normal’ by producing a majority government. The government seemed to operate on the assumption that all three of the opposition parties were its enemies, harbouring a common plan to bring it down. Not surprisingly, political debate was rarely edifying and the legislative record was modest.</p>
         
         <p>For its part, the Conservative Government was focused on its ‘Economic Action Plan’– a stimulus package aimed at ameliorating the worst effects of the global recession. It justified a spending programme at odds with its political ideology by rightly pointing out that the country was weathering the economic storm better than most other developed nations. Matched with the country's very successful hosting of the Olympic winter games, and then the (expensive) G‐20 and G‐8 summits, this ought to have strengthened the Conservatives' hand. Unfortunately for its prospects, every time the Government appeared to be on the rise it managed to do something to convince many Canadians it was stubborn, uncaring, confrontational or all of the above.</p>
         
         <p>In January it announced it would make maternal health an issue in international negotiations but then offended many women's groups by arguing that abortion funding would not be countenanced; later the same month the Government chose to ignore a Supreme Court ruling that it was privy to the violation of a Canadian citizen's constitutional rights while he was held in the United States' Guantanamo Bay prison. In April, the Prime Minister dismissed a junior minister of state from the government (and the party's parliamentary caucus) in response to unsubstantiated allegations about her behaviour. Never told what she was accused of, the young MP was unable to defend herself and was left to sit as a single Independent Conservative member in the House of Commons. Within weeks, the Government was further embarrassed when the Speaker of the House ruled that it had breached parliamentary privilege by refusing to release documents concerning Afghan detainees. Then, over the normally politically quiet summer, the Government caused a great row by announcing that individuals would no longer be required to fill out the long form of the decennial census survey. This generated an unprecedented combination of business, labour, subnational governments, nongovernmental organisations and academic groups protesting the decision. The Government simply refused to reconsider its decision, even in the face of the resignation of the country's Chief Statistician. While none of these individual episodes critically damaged the Government, they seemed to insure it could not build on its economic successes or establish healthy working relationships with the other parties in parliament.</p>
         
         <p>Over the year, the Prime Minister was able to make a number of appointments to the Senate so that, for the first time, the Conservatives gained a majority in the upper house. Most of the appointees had agreed to support the party's plans for reforming the chamber (a plan for elected, fixed terms) and so this opened the way for the Government to proceed. The plan was opposed by some of the provinces as well as the opposition Liberals (the New Democrats had long been on record as favouring abolition of the Senate) who promised to challenge any reform bills in the Supreme Court. Although the Government has not yet moved on the issue, it did begin to use its Senate majority to stifle opposition initiatives.</p>
         
         <p>In another important parliamentary development, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Peter Milliken (a Liberal) marked ten years in office – the longest term in Canadian history. Widely respected by members in all parties, he had been elected four times to preside over deeply divided parliaments. Milliken's announcement in July that he would not stand in the next general election signaled that his skillful handling of the fractious House was coming to an end.</p>
         
         <p>It was a quiet year on the provincial electoral scene with only one of the provinces going to the polls. In New Brunswick, the provincial Conservative Party unseated the Liberal government, making it the first in the province's history to be defeated after its first term in office. Two of the country's leading provincial premiers departed. On the west coast, British Columbia's Gordon Campbell resigned after plunging to single digits in public opinion polls. His government's unpopular and unexpected introduction of a harmonised sales tax (combining the provincial sales tax with the national Goods and Service Tax) had prompted a public backlash, and a citizen initiative calling for a referendum on the tax, so Campbell sought to defuse the issue by resigning. That still leaves the matter of the referendum and British Columbians will vote on it in 2011. Given that the province has voted on Aboriginal rights and electoral reform (twice) in recent years, this seems to be feeding a taste for more direct public involvement in policy making. Meanwhile, on the east coast, Newfoundland and Labrador's extremely popular premier Danny Williams also resigned. Though a Conservative, Williams had publicly feuded with the Prime Minister and then successfully campaigned against the national Conservative Party in the 2008 general election, depriving the government of any seats in the province. There must surely have been some relief in Ottawa to see him go.</p>
         
         <p>Municipal elections sent contradictory signals, evidence of the turbulent state of public opinion and political alignments across the country. In Calgary, oil capital of the country's resource rich conservative province, voters elected an articulate young Muslim new to public office as their mayor. A week later, voters in Toronto, one of the world's most socially diverse cities, elected a traditional anti‐government spending local councilor as its mayor. Both face enormous challenges as the infrastructure deficits of urban Canada grow. Given the ongoing stalemate in the wider political system, neither can confidently look to the national government for help.</p>
