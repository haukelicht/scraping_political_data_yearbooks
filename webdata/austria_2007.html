         <p>After continued infighting (see <b>Cabinet report</b> below), the coalition between the Social Democratic Party of Austria (<i>Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs</i>, SPÖ) and the Christian Democratic Austrian People's Party (<i>Österreichische Volkspartei</i>, ÖVP), which had been formed on 11 January 2007 (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2008</a></span>: 902–907), broke up and premature elections were called. One week after the electoral disaster in the provincial elections in Tyrol on 8 June (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below), the SPÖ, which lagged behind its coalition partner in public support by about 5 per cent, reacted and replaced incumbent party chairman Alfred Gusenbauer. Gusenbauer, who remained Federal Chancellor, was highly unpopular; an opinion poll, carried out in January, revealed that 59 per cent of the people had ‘no good opinion’ of him (<i>Der Standard</i>, 4 February 2008). He was succeeded as party chairman by Werner Faymann, who had been Infrastructure Minister and ‘government coordinator’ since 2007 and who pledged to stress the SPÖ's social credentials in the future.
         </p>
         
         <p>Critics, however, reproached the new SPÖ party chairman for being merely populist. He rejected, for example, the so‐called ‘pension automatic’, on which the social minister (SPÖ) and the economy minister (ÖVP) had just agreed. According to their plan, in the event that the relationship between income and expenditure in pension insurance deteriorates by more than 1 per cent, the ensuing higher expenses would be distributed equally between five pillars: pension age, contributions, level, current increase and government grant. Picking up intra‐party criticisms, Faymann disliked the idea that ‘a computer’ rather than parliament should decide on future pensions. In addition, two weeks after the majority of the Irish people had said ‘No’ to the Lisbon Treaty, Faymann and Gusenbauer announced that in the future major EU treaty amendments should be subject to national referendums. As the Lisbon Treaty had already been ratified by the <i>Nationalrat</i> (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below), this had no immediate consequences. The fact that Faymann and Gusenbauer announced their new EU course in a letter to the editor of the EU‐phobic tabloid <i>Kronenzeitung</i> (read by 41.9 per cent of all Austrians in 2008) was denounced by ÖVP, Greens and newspaper columnists as ‘kowtowing’ (<span title=""><a href="#b12" id="#b12R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009</a></span>: 2–3).
         </p>
         
         <p>As a consequence of the SPÖ changes, on 7 July ÖVP party chairman and Vice‐Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer declared enough was enough and terminated the coalition. Observers speculated that Molterer, who had performed superbly in his previous posts but turned out to be weak as the party's front man, opted for new elections in order to prevent the new SPÖ chief from building his profile, as well as to head off growing intra‐party challenges to his own leadership (cf. <span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Müller 2009</a></span>: 1–2). Not since 1945 had so many parties competed for parliamentary representation (the following section is largely based on <span title=""><a href="#b12" id="#b12R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2009</a></span>: 3–10). The poor performance of the governing parties (see <b>Cabinet report</b> below) produced a record level of protest voters (about one third of all voters, according to opinion pollsters) and encouraged quite a few small and/or new parties to put up candidate lists. In all, ten parties ran for elections at the national level (in some provinces, one or two additional parties took part in the race).
         </p>
         
         <p>Although he was a member of the incumbent cabinet and a government coordinator, SPÖ party chairman and top candidate Faymann was presented as ‘new choice’ on election posters. Without apparent resistance, incumbent Chancellor Gusenbauer accepted his fate and the party united behind his successor. Contrary to 2006, when, as a consequence of the BAWAG scandal, the SPÖ banned trade unionists (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 881), Faymann revived the old tradition of reserving mandates on the SPÖ candidate list for chairpersons of the trade unions' sectoral branches.
         </p>
         
         <p>In order to fight inflation, which reached 3.9 per cent in June, the highest rate for 15 years, Faymann proposed a five‐point programme. A few days before the election, on 24 September, the <i>Nationalrat</i>, with changing majorities, decided to abolish tuition fees for students, introduce a thirteenth family subsidy for all children older than six years, increase the subsidies for personal care and prolong the opportunity open to long‐ and hard‐working people to retire before the regular retirement age. In total, the measures amounted to €2.8 billion (by comparison, in 2007 the federal government had spent €72.3 billion and produced a deficit of €2.9 billion). The fifth point – the reduction of value‐added tax for groceries from 10 to 5 per cent – was dropped as Austria had already introduced two reduced tax rates (and more were not allowed by EU regulation). ÖVP, Greens and some economists had also pointed out that such a measure was socially unjust as rich people would profit from it as well. In any event, economists failed to detect an overarching rationale behind the generous expenditures and warned of increased budget deficits and reduced financial scope for a later big tax reform.
         </p>
         
         <p>As far as coalition options after the elections were concerned, Faymann favoured a renewed coalition with the ÖVP – with the ‘positive’ forces in this party, as he put it, meaning without former Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, Molterer and their entourage. On the other side, he ruled out coalitions with the right‐wing populist parties, the Freedom Party of Austria (<i>Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs</i>, FPÖ) and Alliance for the Future of Austria (<i>Bündnis Zukunft Österreich</i>, BZÖ). He argued that they only stirred up xenophobic feelings, but had no solutions to the immigration problem. The SPÖ campaign was massively supported by the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>, which pursued a personality cult of North Korean proportions around the party's top candidate.
         </p>
         
         <p>Although it was the ÖVP that called off the coalition, the party's election campaign was badly organised. Newspaper commentators explained the lack of enthusiasm among many party functionaries by their expectation that an electoral defeat would remove the ‘old guard’ around Molterer and Schüssel. The ÖVP's top candidate, Molterer, was perceived by the public as stuffy – as a good clerk, but not as an inspiring political leader. At the beginning of his campaign, Molterer pointed to the reliability and sincerity of his party, which, in contrast to the Social Democrats, was not willing to make excessive promises to the voters, which guaranteed a balanced budget and stood unshakably committed to the EU. In the end, however, the ÖVP, mindful of public opinion, agreed to three of the five Faymann initiatives. Another prominent issue in the ÖVP's campaign was security. The party presented its Minister of the Interior as a tough lady, fighting to secure law and order against criminals, particularly sexual offenders and asylum seekers. In fact, some ÖVP slogans (e.g., ‘No immigration without a German‐language course’) could be taken for FPÖ ones.</p>
         
         <p>The Greens' campaign focussed on their top candidate and party chairman, university professor of economics Alexander van der Bellen. Until three weeks before the elections their campaign was overshadowed by internal controversies over the candidate lists. The election programme contained, among others, demands to extend investment in public transport and alternative energies, to introduce a basic income of €900 per month, to make kindergarten free of charge and to implement gender equality. To stress their support for nongovernmental organisations and their commitment to human rights, they put up an animal rights activist, who had been imprisoned on the basis of an anti‐mafia paragraph in the criminal code – a risky strategy, apt to alienate moderate sympathisers. In addition, they presented themselves as a bulwark against right‐wing populism and excluded any coalition with FPÖ or BZÖ.</p>
         
         <p>As usual, the FPÖ, under its chairman Heinz‐Christian Strache, focused on patriotism, immigration, security and welfare. Strache criticised the high levels of criminality and the reluctance of many (and above all Muslim) immigrants to assimilate into Austrian society and learn the German language. He declared that immigrants should be denied social benefits until they had acquired Austrian citizenship (i.e., for ten years). The SPÖ was criticised for its broken electoral promises, the ÖVP for its ‘arrogance of power’ and its submissiveness towards the EU, and the Greens for their crude multicultural utopianism. In general, however, the FPÖ formulated its claims less aggressively than in the past. Like the BZÖ, it profited from Faymann's five‐point initiative as the SPÖ chairman was forced to negotiate with both parties to find the necessary parliamentary majorities.</p>
         
         <p>The BZÖ, which had split from the FPÖ in 2005 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1042–1047) and had almost failed to re‐enter the <i>Nationalrat</i> in 2006, counted on former FPÖ and now BZÖ party chairman Jörg Haider, provincial governor in Carinthia since 1999, as its top candidate. The BZÖ campaign depicted Haider as ‘the original’ (in contrast to ‘the copy’– i.e., FPÖ party chairman Strache), tried to address protest voters and demanded measures against inflation. Relentlessly, Haider presented his province as a model for Austria, by pointing to the anti‐inflation measures he had enacted there (e.g., direct subsidies for people of low income, cheaper oil, free kindergarten). According to opinion polls, Haider made the best out of his appearances in the televised debates between the top candidates.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the beginning, opinion polls gave at least two other parties a chance of clearing the threshold for parliamentary representation (4 per cent of the national votes or a basic mandate in one of the 43 regional electoral districts). The Liberals, who had been thrown out of Parliament in 1999, wanted to offer voters disappointed by the governing parties an alternative to FPÖ or BZÖ. Advocating a free market, supplemented by higher taxes for the rich, and a basic income, they stressed human rights and dismissed exclusion, populism, scare tactics and deception of the people. All their hopes were spoiled irrevocably, however, when the young party chairman (who had been an MP on a SPÖ ticket since 2006) admitted to having worked for the Euro‐fighter company (for the scandal concerning the Euro‐fighters, see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 888–889).
         </p>
         
         <p>Good prospects were also seen for the List Fritz, named after the former president of the Tyrolean Chamber of Labour (Fritz Dinkhauser), who had won 18.4 per cent of the votes in the general elections in the province three months before (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below). However, the campaign of the ‘working‐class hero’ was perceived as too personalised and lacking substance; even his Tyrolean voters seemed to prefer him to stay in the province and not to move to Vienna.
         </p>
         
         <p>Three more parties nominated candidates, but did not represent serious competition, partly because of their sectarianism. As always, the Communists advocated a re‐distribution of wealth from the rich to the poor; they favoured equal social rights for natives and foreigners. The main issue of ‘The Christians’ was the family; in order to increase the birth rate, they wanted to introduce a ‘mother's income’ and make abortion up to the twelfth week of pregnancy once again subject to prosecution (as had been the case before 1975). The anti‐EU‐oriented Citizen Initiative ‘Save Austria’ defended the country's neutrality, and fought for a national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and a ban on genetic engineering.</p>
         
         <p>Newspaper analysts lamented that while the world economy was tumbling into the biggest crisis since the 1930s, the political class in Austria, thanks primarily to the Social Democrats, quarrelled over a questionable reduction of value‐added taxes. Populist tendencies characterised the electoral campaigns of most parties, while the really important problems of the country (such as education, health or climate change) were neglected. An opinion poll revealed that the campaigns held negative associations (horror, anger, political theatre, chaos, liars, broken promises, etc.) for 71 per cent of Austrians, while 80 per cent deplored the lack of vision on the part of the politicians (<i>Der Standard</i>, 19 September 2008).
         </p>
         
         <p>Interestingly, the EU was also left aside by the parties, although the issue had to some extent prompted the premature elections. One reason for this might have been that the parties (except the Greens, the Liberals and, to some degree, the ÖVP) were united in their Eurosceptic positions. SPÖ, FPÖ, BZÖ, the List Fritz, the Communists and the Citizen Initiative ‘Save Austria’ advocated national referendums on future EU treaty amendments, and SPÖ, ÖVP and BZÖ on the EU accession of Turkey (FPÖ and the List Fritz rejected Turkish accession on any terms). Obviously, SPÖ party chairman Faymann was not interested in an EU debate as this might have ruined any chances of a renewed coalition with the ÖVP. At the same time, the influential tabloid <i>Kronenzeitung</i> published EU‐critical articles or letters to the editor and criticised ‘un‐patriotic’ÖVP positions almost every day.
         </p>
         
         <p>Voter turnout amounted to 78.8 per cent (i.e., 0.3 per cent more than 2006). As expected, voter volatility reached new heights. Some 33 per cent of voters decided only in the last two weeks before the elections which party to vote for; 28 per cent voted for a different party to that which they had voted for two years ago (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>GfK Austria Politikforschung</i> 2008</a></span>: 5, 7). As a consequence, the governing parties, SPÖ and ÖVP, lost a significant vote share. The 29.3 per cent share of the SPÖ meant the worst election result for the party since 1945. Never before had the strongest party's vote share fallen below 30 per cent. The ÖVP lost even more votes than the SPÖ (−8.3 as compared to −6 per cent). A major handicap of the ÖVP was that its top candidate was not very popular even among the party's own voters; only 25 per cent mentioned him as a voting motive (in contrast to this, 53 per cent of the SPÖ voters mentioned Faymann). In the population as a whole, Faymann also ranked before Molterer on the question of who should become chancellor (21 and 15 per cent, respectively –<span title=""><a href="#b14" id="#b14R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">ISA/SORA 2008</a></span>: 22, 30). That the SPÖ was able to convert a 5 per cent ÖVP lead at the beginning of the electoral contest into a 3 per cent lead for itself on polling day was also due to the support of the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>. Of those who only read the tabloid, 39 per cent voted for the SPÖ, 26 per cent for the FPÖ, 17 for the ÖVP, 12 for the BZÖ and only 1 per cent for the Greens (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>GfK Austria Politikforschung</i> 2008</a></span>: 31–32).
         </p>
         
         <p>The elections strengthened the extreme right. Both parties in this spectrum, FPÖ and BZÖ, were voted for mostly in order to ‘bring a wind of change’ (65 and 67 per cent, respectively) and to ‘protest against the government’ (61 and 50 per cent, respectively). The immigration issue was ‘very important’ for 73 per cent of the FPÖ voters and for 75 per cent of the BZÖ voters (<span title=""><a href="#b14" id="#b14R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">ISA/SORA 2008</a></span>: 13, 21). The overall gains of the FPÖ (+6.5 to 17.5 per cent) were predicted by opinion polls, although its success among young voters came as a surprise: 33 per cent of people up to the age of 29 voted for FPÖ, 20 per cent for ÖVP, 14 each for SPÖ and Greens, and 10 for BZÖ.
         </p>
         
         <p>The extent of the BZÖ's success was unexpected, however. In the beginning of the campaign, 4–6 per cent of the voters were predicted to vote for the party; in the end, it was able to almost triple its share of the votes (from 4.1 to 10.7 per cent). Top candidate Haider was by far the most important reason for voting for the party (for 49 per cent of the BZÖ voters), followed by ‘makes reliable policy in Carinthia’, ‘programme/better party’ and ‘anger about other parties’ (all 13 per cent) (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>GfK Austria Politikforschung</i> 2008</a></span>: 10, 24).
         </p>
         
         <p>The Greens, on the other hand, could not exploit the unpopularity of the governing parties and high political alienation among the voters and stalled slightly (−0.7 per cent). The new and/or small parties almost disappeared from the news headlines and the television screens during the last weeks before the election and clearly failed to enter Parliament (the Liberals reached 2.1, the List Fritz 1.8, the Communists 0.8, the Citizen Initiative ‘Save Austria’ 0.7 and the Christians 0.6 per cent).</p>
         
         <p>The election results led to personnel reshuffles in the party leaderships of ÖVP and Greens. As widely expected, the Minister of Agriculture and Environment Josef Pröll, a nephew of the party chairman of the strongest provincial organisation of the ÖVP and governor in Lower Austria, took over the position as ÖVP party chairman (replacing Molterer). As the chairman of the ÖVP parliamentary group was also elected anew (replacing former Chancellor Schüssel) and as Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik and Economy Minister Martin Bartenstein resigned during the coalition negotiations (see <b>Cabinet report</b> below), all ÖVP politicians located in the Schüssel ‘camp’ had to give up their leading positions (though all of them, except Plassnik, remained ordinary MPs). The Greens, despite claiming that their electoral stagnation was not the major reason, likewise changed their leadership (the economist van der Bellen was replaced as party chairperson by the higher‐profile deputy chairwoman, Eva Glawischnig).
         </p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Cabinet report</h2>
         
         <p>The ‘grand coalition’ between SPÖ and ÖVP, formed on 11 January 2007, was ill‐fated right from the start. In spite of the fact that the SPÖ had won the previous general elections (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 876–883), the ÖVP obtained the major portfolios (finance, economics, interior and foreign affairs) and vetoed the revision of any of its major policies of the 2000–2007 period (from 2000 to 2005 it had led a centre‐right coalition with the FPÖ, from 2005 to 2007 with the BZÖ). The new Federal Chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer (SPÖ), was constantly accused by both the mass media and internal critics that he had forsaken important electoral promises and his party's credibility for his personal ambition to become government chief. Former Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel refrained from serving as Vice‐Chancellor under Gusenbauer, but was defending his political legacy as new chairman of the ÖVP's parliamentary group. Therefore, the Gusenbauer I cabinet was characterised by ongoing inter‐party conflicts and unresolved questions, resulting in the disastrous public image of the two governing parties (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2008</a></span>; 906–907).
         </p>
         
         <p>Coalition infighting continued during the first half of 2008. Constant battles were fought between the ministers of social affairs (SPÖ) and of economic affairs (ÖVP), concerning questions such as labour market policy (the responsibility for which had been moved to the latter ministry in 2000), the introduction of a guaranteed minimum income or personal care. With rising inflation, tax policy constituted another dividing line: while the SPÖ wanted to backdate the planned tax reform from 2010 to 2009 and rejected the ‘family splitting’ model of the ÖVP (which, as it was claimed, would increase the motivation of women, who usually earn less than men, to stay at home), its coalition partner took opposite positions. The ÖVP also objected to SPÖ plans to officially recognise homosexual partnerships.</p>
         
         <p>In late March, it looked as if the intra‐government conflicts could be pacified for the time being. SPÖ and ÖVP agreed to realise the big tax reform only in 2010, but to help low‐income people (by reducing their contributions to unemployment insurance and by increasing pensions) in 2009. To raise money for the health sector (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below) a new property increase tax for shares and real estate was to be introduced (this agreement was soon questioned by the ÖVP Minister of Economic Affairs, however). Beyond that, the coalition parties agreed on a working programme, consisting of 97 projects to be finalised by the end of the year.
         </p>
         
         <p>In mid‐year, the cabinet was reshuffled as a consequence of coalition infighting, the strategic problems of the SPÖ and the results of the provincial elections in Tyrol, which had also weakened the ÖVP (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below). The Minister of Women, Media and Public Service, Doris Bures, moved back into the SPÖ party headquarters to take over the function of federal whip (a position she had already held between 2000 and 2007). She was replaced by Heidrun Silhavy, who had been member of the <i>Nationalrat</i> from 1994 to 2007 and state secretary since 2007, responsible for regional policy and administrative reform. On the same day, the Minister of the Interior, Günther Platter (ÖVP), who was to become provincial governor in Tyrol, was replaced by Maria Fekter, who had been state secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs from 1990 to 1994, chairwoman of the justice committee in the <i>Nationalrat</i> from 1995 to 2007 and member of the Ombudsman Board since then.
         </p>
         
         <p>The personnel reshuffle could not prevent the break‐down of government, however. The results of the following parliamentary elections (see <b>General elections</b> above) as well as the international challenges left hardly any other option but to renew the SPÖ‐ÖVP partnership. The performance of the two governing parties had been miserable, and both had been punished with the worst election results in their history. Yet the need to cope with the financial crisis (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below) was interpreted by leading SPÖ and ÖVP politicians, media and public as precluding political experiments. Opinion polls revealed that 97 per cent of SPÖ voters and 75 per cent of ÖVP voters wanted their party to take part in government at any rate (<i>Der Standard</i>, 10 November 2008). Alternative options, especially a right‐wing ÖVP‐FPÖ‐BZÖ coalition, were given up after BZÖ party chairman Jörg Haider died in a car accident on 11 October. The BZÖ lacked an effective party organisation as well as a clear programme and was equated with Haider. Without his leadership, the party was expected to disintegrate sooner or later – and therefore seemed too hazardous as a coalition partner. FPÖ Party Chairman Strache excluded himself from coalition formation by imposing excessive conditions (e.g., an immediate national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and the EU accession of Turkey). Above all, the FPÖ lacked qualified government personnel.
         </p>
         
         <p>While in 2006 government formation between SPÖ and ÖVP had taken 103 days (the third‐longest duration after 1945), this time the new coalition was sworn in 65 days after the elections. The SPÖ‐ÖVP talks were hampered by tactical considerations and policy differences, however. While SPÖ Party Chairman Werner Faymann, who on 8 October got the official mandate from Federal President Heinz Fischer (SPÖ) to form a government, planned to finish the process before Christmas, his opposite number, the new ÖVP Party Chairman Josef Pröll, refused to enter ‘coalition negotiations’ immediately. Instead, he urged Faymann to organise ‘Austria talks’ with the leaders of all parliamentary parties. He argued that major reforms (e.g., in the health sector or concerning federalism) needed a two‐thirds majority in parliament, which an SPÖ‐ÖVP government could not command. In addition, hinting at the bad image of the last SPÖ‐ÖVP government, he concluded it would be political suicide just to agree on a few headlines in order to quarrel about the details afterwards. His pending formal installation as party chairman by the ÖVP party congress, scheduled for 28 November, and the reservation of some provincial organisations against a coalition with the SPÖ prompted Pröll to show a less compromising attitude. On 16 November, he even interrupted the coalition negotiations to ask his counterpart Faymann ‘ten questions’ to test his enthusiasm for reform. However, within one day Faymann reacted to the ten (vague) questions with ten (vague) answers. Media commentators sneered at the episode and its actors (Pröll playing the headmaster, Faymann the exemplary pupil) – all the more as on some of the issues compromises had already been achieved in the negotiations.</p>
         
         <p>The coalition negotiations, which had started on 21 October, were terminated on 23 November. The SPÖ party executive approved of the coalition pact unanimously; in the ÖVP, of the 32 members, three (two from Styria, one from Carinthia) opposed it, but a few days later Pröll was confirmed as party chairman by the delegates to the party congress with 89.6 per cent of the vote. The coalition programme was very long (288 pages, as compared to 167 pages in 2006), but it was criticised by opposition and media as lacking vision and operability. Media commentators warned the governing parties that simply administering problems would further strengthen the populists (i.e., FPÖ and BZÖ). However, concrete state, health, pension, education or integration reforms were missing from the coalition programme.</p>
         
         <p>In the face of the prevailing (most probably, worsening) financial crisis, doubts were raised regarding the goal of keeping the annual budget deficit in the following five years under the Maastricht guideline of 3 per cent of the GDP. Some 79 projects were marked with an asterisk, indicating that they were to be financed by budgetary redeployments within the ministries. Many other projects were to be discussed by ‘working groups’ or delegated to the social partners (the major interest groups of employers and employees).</p>
         
         <p>The EU issue was defused in that the two parties committed themselves ‘in unrestrained form to the project of European integration’; they announced they would work hard so that Europe would ‘engage increasingly in the fields of growth, employment, social affairs, sustainable climate, environment and traffic policy as well as consumer protection’. While this provision bore the hallmark of SPÖ, ÖVP could be satisfied with the clause forbidding each party to make or support any parliamentary motion to hold a national referendum against the will of its coalition partner. Incumbent Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik (ÖVP) objected to this compromise and resigned.</p>
         
         <p>Including the Federal Chancellor, both governing parties nominated seven ministers and two state secretaries (the latter formally serve as assistants to ministers and take part in cabinet meetings, but are not entitled to vote). The new cabinet was led by Chancellor Faymann (SPÖ) and Vice‐Chancellor (and new Minister of Finance) Pröll; both had acted as government coordinators in the predecessor cabinet and were considered pragmatic, consensus‐oriented politicians. The scope and distribution of portfolios was slightly changed. The responsibilities for Health and for Employment (the latter since 2000 part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs) were moved from the ÖVP to the SPÖ; together with the Ministry of Social Affairs, the SPÖ could now claim that all important ‘social’ portfolios were in its hands. In compensation, Justice was taken over by the ÖVP – a re‐arrangement criticised by constitutional lawyers who preferred Justice and Interior not to be controlled by one party.</p>
         
         <p>Of the SPÖ members of the incumbent government, the Ministers of Education and of Defence remained in office. Doris Bures, from January 2007 until July 2008 responsible for Women, Media and Public Service, followed Faymann as new Minister of Infrastructure (for short biographies of the ‘old’ ministers, see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2008</a></span>: 904–905). Rudolf Hundstorfer, from 1995 to 2007 chairman of the Viennese municipal council and after 2007 (following the BAWAG scandal) President of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB), was appointed as the new Minister of Social Affairs and Labour. Gabriele Heinisch‐Hosek, a member of the National Council since 1999 and after 2004 her party's speaker for women's affairs, was nominated to lead the revived Ministry of Women (including Public Service). The new Minister of Health Alois Stöger had made his career in local politics and in the trade unions before he came to direct the provincial sickness insurance fund of Upper Austria in 2005.
         </p>
         
         <p>ÖVP Party Chairman Pröll also relied on two ministers who had already served in the outgoing cabinet – namely the Ministers for the Interior and for Science. Michael Spindelegger, who had been Member of the National Council (since 1993, with interruptions), speaker of his party for foreign affairs (from 1996 till 2006) and second president of the National Council since 2006, was promoted to the position of Foreign Minister. A surprise was the nomination of Claudia Bandion‐Ortner, who had gained prominence as judge in the BAWAG trial (and was not an ÖVP party member), as Minister of Justice. Nikolaus Berlakovich, who had been member of the provincial parliament (1991–2005) and of the provincial government (since 2005) of Burgenland, was chosen as Minister of Agriculture. The ÖVP cabinet list was completed by the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Reinhold Mitterlehner, who had been member of the National Council and worked as deputy general secretary of the Chamber of Business since 2000. Together with the new Minister of Social Affairs and Labour, he symbolised the renewed strength of social partnership, which had been downgraded by the right‐wing cabinets under Chancellor Schüssel between 2000 and 2007.</p>
         
         <p>The four state secretaries were also evenly divided between the two governing parties. The two SPÖ secretaries were established in the Chancellery (responsible for media) and in the Ministry of Finance. The ÖVP likewise sent one of its secretaries into the Ministry of Finance. The fourth secretary (ÖVP) was located in the Ministry of Economic Affairs (responsible for family and youth).</p>

         <p>As in the previous year (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2008</a></span>: 909–911), parliamentary investigations strained relations between the coalition parties SPÖ and ÖVP. On 3 March, the SPÖ joined forces with the opposition parties to establish a committee of enquiry (the seventeenth since 1945) to investigate suspicions of ‘cover‐ups of police affairs’ as well as of the ‘abuse of political power’– in particular in the Ministry of the Interior (headed by the ÖVP). The former chief of the Federal Criminal Office reported that in 2006, a few months before the general elections, the minister's cabinet had prohibited him from examining police failures in the famous kidnapping case of Natascha Kampusch. For reasons that were unclear, early hints as to whereabouts of the kidnapper had been ignored by the police, with the consequence that the girl was held in captivity for eight years (1998–2006). Furthermore, the criminologist accused the minister's cabinet of having urged him to send information on a special committee, which had been established to investigate the BAWAG affair, to the ÖVP parliamentary group in the first instance. The cabinet was, he claimed, interested in suspected financial transfers of the bank to the SPÖ, but did not intervene in criminal investigations. In addition to these issues, the enquiry was mandated to investigate a potpourri of 32 allegations, including the abuse of police agencies for party purposes, leaks of confidential information and protocols to the media, the manipulation of files and the illegal issuing of entrance visas by Austrian consulates in East European countries. The ÖVP hampered the proceedings of the committee of enquiry, which it regarded as a political tribunal, and its ministers supplied the needed documents with great reluctance. Because of the premature general elections, the investigations were stopped before the committee had dealt with all points of its mandate. The final report, which all parties, except the Greens, approved, contained only a description of its proceedings, but no political conclusions.
         </p>
         
         <p>A recurrent issue during 2008 was health policy, owing to the chronic deficits of the sickness insurance funds, which amounted to €354.8 million at the end of 2007. Although the Audit Office estimated that up to €2.9 billion could be saved in the health sector, solutions were difficult to find: the system is financed from multiple sources and many institutions and interest groups are involved in policy making including the Ministry of Health, 16 self‐governing, provincially and sectorally organised sickness insurance funds (which finance the private doctors), the Federation of Austrian Social Insurance Institutions (which coordinates the funds), the provinces and municipalities (which own and administer most hospitals), the major interest groups of business, labour and farmers (the so‐called ‘social partners’), the Chamber of Doctors, and, last but not least, the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
         
         <p>In April, the social partners presented a reform plan by which €600 million could be saved. It suggested transferring responsibility for the hospitals from provinces and municipalities to the insurance funds, oblige doctors to provide patients with a detailed account of their treatment and to prescribe only active substances (while the medicine should be selected by pharmacists), introduce quality controls and contracts with single doctors (in case negotiations with the Chamber of Doctors fail) and convert the Federation of Austrian Social Insurance Institutions into a holding company with steering capacity. The plan was resisted by provinces and doctors. Nevertheless, the minister included all major proposals of the social partners, except the transfer of responsibilities for the hospitals, into her bill (in compensation, the government promised to pour €1.4 billion into the funds until 2012). The Chamber of Doctors, the ÖAAB (the constituent organisation of the ÖVP representing the workers), several provincial organisations of the SPÖ, several insurance funds, the opposition parties and the Audit Office (which deplored the failure to tackle hospital financing) criticised the plans. On 3 June, 8,000 doctors demonstrated in front of the Chancellery for the third time in history (following demonstrations in 1955 and 1972) and on 16 June, 15,000 doctors kept their offices closed. As a consequence of the premature general elections, parliamentary discussions about the health reform bill were interrupted and not resumed by the newly elected <i>Nationalrat</i> in 2008.
         </p>
         
         <p>After the general elections and parallel to the coalition negotiations, the international financial crisis challenged policy makers. On 9 October, the benchmark index of the Viennese stock exchange experienced the highest fall of all time. The day after, trading had to be suspended for the first time in history. Two weeks later, the <i>Nationalrat</i>, with the votes of all parties, passed an economic package of €1.0 billion for small and medium‐sized enterprises. Including state guarantees, the measures amounted to €270 billion (roughly the size of Austria's GDP). The government guaranteed all private bank deposits without limitation, the deposits of SMEs up to €50,000. The state would be liable for credits among the banks up to €75 billion. Some €15 billion was reserved for direct subsidies to banks (to be given only under the condition of state influence, for example, on executive remuneration). In November, SPÖ and ÖVP agreed in their coalition negotiations to backdate not only parts, but the whole big tax reform (worth €2.7 billion) from 2010 to 2009. At the same time, a second economic package (worth €1.9 billion) was decided, including measures to refurbish old buildings and investments in childcare facilities. Economic experts welcomed the government initiatives.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the context of the general elections, Austria's relationship with its history, in particular its Nazi past (1938–1945), caused political controversies. As the third strongest party, the FPÖ was entitled to nominate a candidate for the third president of the <i>Nationalrat</i>. The party nominated Martin Graf, who had been a member of a student league assessed as right‐wing extremist by the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance. ÖVP and BZÖ supported the FPÖ by hinting to the parliamentary norm that the presidency reflect party strength and to the fact that Graf had, without any criticism, recently chaired the parliamentary committee investigating the bank scandal (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 888–889; 2008: 911). The Greens, on the other hand, pointed out that once before, in 1996, the FPÖ had to search for another candidate after the first nominee had been rejected by the other parties. As an alternative to Graf, they nominated former party chairman Alexander van der Bellen. Because of the intense public and intra‐party debate, the SPÖ allowed its MPs to vote freely. Finally, Graf was elected on 28 October by 109 of 156 valid votes; all present FPÖ, ÖVP and BZÖ MPs and the great majority of the SPÖ MPs voted for him. Van der Bellen received 27 votes. The debate about Graf was resumed at the end of the year when it came out that members of his staff had ordered T‐shirts with neo‐Nazi slogans from a German online store.
         </p>
         
         <p>In 2008, general (<i>Landtag</i>) elections were held in two provinces. In Lower Austria, the second largest province, the ÖVP had dominated affairs after 1945, most often by absolute majorities. It has to share power, however, as a consequence of the constitutional obligation to form ‘<i>Proporz</i>’ governments, composed of all major parties according to their strength in parliament. On 9 March, the ÖVP once again headed for a clear victory. The incumbent provincial governor Erwin Pröll (ÖVP), who also exercises great influence at the federal level and has usually supported SPÖ‐ÖVP coalitions, distanced himself from the ‘quarrels and standstill’ in the national capital. In a populist manner, he addressed right‐wing voters by declaring minarets to be ‘foreign to the species’, and not good for a culture in the long run. Furthermore, he demanded that Austrian police and the army continued to secure the boundaries to the East even after the Schengen regulations had been extended to the Czech Republic and Slovakia in December 2007. At the same time, however, he gathered prominent intellectuals, artists and a former Green member of the national parliament around him and hinted at his recent social initiatives (e.g., additional expenditures for personal care and childcare institutions). With this all‐encompassing strategy the ÖVP won 54.4 (i.e., +1.1) per cent of the votes. The SPÖ, whose attempts to position itself as ‘social conscience’ were overwhelmed by the ÖVP initiatives and suffered from a stuffy top candidate, lost 8.1 per cent of the votes to come down to 25.5 per cent, its worst election result since 1945.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Greens, like the rest of the parties, attacked the ‘system Pröll’ and focused on traditional issues, especially public transport and democratic control. However, they fell slightly from 7.2 to 6.9 per cent of the votes. The FPÖ was led by a member of the National Council, who, not surprisingly, warned of waves of immigrants and rising criminality and upheld the ‘family’ (herself having ten children). Like the ÖVP governor, the FPÖ profited from the bad image of the national SPÖ‐ÖVP coalition; it was able to increase its share of the vote from 4.5 to 10.5 per cent. All other parties, including the BZÖ, achieved less than 1 per cent and failed to enter parliament. In the new (proportionally composed) government, the SPÖ had to cede one of its three seats to the FPÖ, while the ÖVP maintained its six seats.</p>
         
         <p>The second provincial contest took place in Tyrol on 8 June. In contrast to Lower Austria, the province is governed by a majority (not a <i>Proporz</i>) government. Surprisingly, after the last elections in 2003, the ÖVP, in spite of its absolute majority, had invited the SPÖ to participate in a coalition. This time, the ÖVP was expected to lose dramatically, after the former president of the provincial Chamber of Labour (and ÖVP member) Fritz Dinkhauser announced he was going run in the elections with his own list.
         </p>
         
         <p>The list ‘Fritz’ comprised representatives of nongovernmental organisations and politicians of nearly all political colours. Dinkhauser, who stood for the buried Christian‐social roots of the ÖVP, fought for the interests of the ‘small man’, against the pre‐dominance of agrarian communities and the prevailing nepotism in Tyrolean politics. The populist strategy was successful; the list Fritz climbed to 18.4 per cent of the vote. The main victim was the ÖVP, whose campaign had focused on tradition and the economic successes of the province. However, this could not compensate for the failure to reduce the transit truck traffic between Germany and Italy across the Brenner Pass and for the lack of popularity enjoyed by its top candidate, the incumbent provincial governor. The ÖVP got only 40.5 per cent, which was 9.4 per cent less than previously. The other parties were not visible in the campaign. The SPÖ, whose usual social appeal was captured by the ‘rebel’ Dinkhauser, plunged from 25.9 to 15.5 per cent of the vote, the Greens from 15.6 to 10.7 per cent. Only the FPÖ, which stressed its well‐known issues, rose from 8.0 to 12.4 per cent, in spite of constant leadership struggles.</p>
         
         <p>As a consequence of the electoral disaster, the incumbent provincial governor had to deliver his office to the Minister of the Interior, Günther Platter (ÖVP), who returned to his home province. The ÖVP‐SPÖ coalition (six ÖVP versus two SPÖ members) was continued, however. Needless to say, although federal politicians stressed the ‘provincial’ character of the elections, they had an impact on national politics. Both ÖVP and SPÖ rebuilt their cabinet teams (see <b>Cabinet report</b> above). More importantly, the SPÖ re‐positioned itself just a few weeks after the Tyrolean elections and this finally led to the breakdown of the federal coalition.
         </p>
         
         <p>As in most years since its accession to the European Union in 1995, Austria maintained its tradition as one of those states with the lowest public support for membership. In the Eurobarometer survey in spring (no. 69), only 36 per cent of Austrians were of the opinion that EU membership is a ‘good thing’, putting them last but three among the EU‐27 (the average being 52 per cent). A major reason for this high level of Euroscepticism is the constant anti‐EU campaign waged by the two right‐wing populist parties, FPÖ and BZÖ, and by the most widely read tabloid, the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>. In the weeks before the Lisbon Treaty was due to be ratified by the <i>Nationalrat</i>, several nongovernmental organisations (the anti‐globalisation Attac, a platform called ‘<i>Volxsabstimmung</i>’, the citizen initiative ‘Save Austria’, etc.) tried to take advantage of widespread Euroscepticism and demanded a national referendum on the Treaty.
         </p>
         
         <p>Left‐leaning critics predicted that the Treaty would intensify the neo‐liberal character of the EU (by, e.g., further liberalising public services) and lead to its militarisation (through the planned ‘Battle Groups’, which could act without mandate of the UN Security Council). Above all, they argued that the strengthened European Parliament and the Charter of Fundamental Rights were simply means to disguise its ‘real’ goals. Right‐leaning critics were afraid of a further loss of Austrian sovereignty, in particular its neutrality. They warned of EU ‘dictatorship’ and of a social catastrophe.</p>
         
         <p>In spite of support from FPÖ, BZÖ and the <i>Kronenzeitung</i>, however, such resistance was in vain. The <i>Nationalrat</i> passed the Lisbon Treaty on 9 April with 151 votes of SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens, against 27 votes of FPÖ and BZÖ. Although many advocates of the Lisbon Treaty did not regard it (or, indeed, the EU in general) as optimal, they saw the Treaty as a clear step forward to a more democratic and efficient EU and reproached the opponents for their disinformation, scare tactics and nationalistic perspective. Euroscepticism in Austria is not likely to decline in the near future. The parliamentary elections in September fostered the populist, anti‐EU strategies of the parties (see <b>General elections</b> above), and the changes in party leadership of SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens led to the resignation of several EU enthusiasts.
