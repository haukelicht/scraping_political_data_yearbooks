         <p>‘Omnishambles’ is the informal modern word that best sums up New Zealand politics in 2012. The year was chaotically busy – full of blunders, follies and scandal. All political parties suffered from bad press, leaving most political leaders with diminished reputations. For instance, the main party of government – the National Party – was plagued by numerous controversies, terrible political management and a poorly performing economy. Meanwhile, the main party of opposition – Labour – was beset by continued leadership instability and poor performance in general. However, because problems were evenly distributed across the political system, no particular party received any advantage, producing something of a stalemate. Hence public opinion polls remained virtually unchanged from the start of the year to the end.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0003"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0003-title"> The national government</h2>
         
         <p>The year 2012 was the National Party's fourth in office, and it was undoubtedly the worst one since coming to power – or indeed since John Key became its leader in 2006. The Prime Minister himself had a terrible year – a fact that all commentators agreed upon. Although his personal popularity remained high throughout the year, a number of incidents reflected very poorly on him, and possibly set the scene for a future erosion of support. At the end of 2012, one public opinion poll asked voters to mark the government's performance on a scale of 0 to 10, and the results averaged 4.9. This gives some indication of the messy and torrid year National had. There follows a discussion of the most important issues, controversies and scandals faced by the government.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0004"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0004-title"> Asset sales and water claims</h2>
         
         <p>It is hard to pick which political scandals and controversies were the most important, but the government's problematic privatisation programme was constantly in the headlines from the start until the end of the year. The National Party had campaigned at the previous 2011 general election on the notion, saying it would sell up to 49 per cent of five state‐owned enterprises (three power companies, one coal company and the national airline). This privatisation was marketed under the concept of the ‘mixed ownership model’ – the idea of only selling a minority stake via a share float on the stock exchange. The public never enthusiastically embraced the policy, and in fact protests and debate continued throughout the year. Opponents questioned the economic logic of selling the highly profitable assets, the likelihood of some foreign ownership and whether the sales would increase the divide between rich and poor.</p>
         
         <p>The biggest threat to the sales came from Maori – some of whom were concerned that the sale of the energy companies with hydro‐electric generators could pre‐empt or inhibit their own ongoing fights to gain legal recognition of traditional water rights. Such rights were said to have been established in 1840 when the Treaty of Waitangi was signed – a document that is often considered the founding document of the nation, and one that has become the central source for remedying past injustices and continuing inequalities suffered by Maori. With the asset sales looming, the Maori Council, a statutory organisation representing Maori interests, took a case against the government to the Waitangi Tribunal – a semi‐judicial body charged with investigating alleged breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. The tribunal ruled in favour of the Maori Council, forcing the government to consult further with tribes (‘<i>iwi</i>’) about how it might solve water rights claims while still selling the hydro‐electric power companies.
         </p>
         
         <p>These hurdles therefore significantly disrupted the government's partial privatisation timetable. In September, the government announced that the share float of the first power company, Mighty River Power, which had been planned for 2012, would now take place near the middle of 2013. Immediately the Maori Council took the government to the High Court to prevent the sale, but lost.</p>
         
         <p>The issue became one of frustration for all sides. The government was determined to push through the power company sales because the programme had become a lynchpin not only of its economic agenda – for which it badly needed the sale proceeds – but also for its reputation for political management. The partial sale of the power companies had become even more crucial because the other (non‐power company) state‐owned enterprises were also taken off the immediate sale list – Air New Zealand because of the uncertain state of the airline industry, and the coal‐mining Solid Energy company because of its sudden poor economic performance.</p>
         
         <p>The asset sales programme was a major issue for the government's relationship with Maoridom, but it was not entirely negative for National. The episode actually highlighted the fact that the government had developed an increasingly good working relationship with a rising body of Maori leaders – the Iwi Leadership Group. Furthermore, the government continued to advance Treaty of Waitangi claims. Most notably, a deal was negotiated with the North Island tribe, Tuhoe – an agreement long seen as almost unobtainable.</p>
         
         <p>The Maori Party continued in coalition with the National Government despite these difficult issues, with both party co‐leaders resisting pressure to resign from their ministerial positions. Those leaders – Tariana Turia (aged 68) and Pita Sharples (aged 71) – were obviously nearing retirement and the party's fortunes appeared to be fading. Turia announced in December that she planned to depart from politics at the next election. She also, somewhat surprisingly, publicly called for her co‐leader to also step down. The issue of leadership succession had long been a problem, and the fact that it remained unresolved continued to call into question the future viability of the Maori Party.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0005"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0005-title"> ACC scandal and privacy leaks</h2>
         
         <p>National Minister Nick Smith resigned from the government in March after it was revealed that he had written a letter to his own ministry (on official letterhead) in support of a personal friend who was seeking compensation from the government. It appeared as if he was compromised by a conflict of interest. The scandal concerned the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) – the country's unique compulsory state provider of accident insurance. A client of the organisation, Bronwyn Pullar – a National Party activist and friend of the minister – had been battling with the organisation for years over compensation for her own injuries. She had 45 separate complaints against the agency, one of which was about privacy breaches, because she had been accidentally emailed a file containing the personal details of over 6,000 ACC claimants. The scandal was complicated, but a string of subsequent blunders and intrigues eventually led to a number of heads rolling, including the ACC's chairman and three other board members, as well as the chief executive. The new minister, National MP Judith Collins, became embroiled in the saga, and it escalated with a police investigation, allegations of blackmail, the malicious leaks of political material and even the brief involvement of the prime minister in the firing line. The debacle led the privacy commissioner to intervene, and she issued a call for all government agencies to improve their performance on privacy. Nonetheless, other violations started to emerge.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0006"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0006-title"> Education</h2>
         
         <p>The government's worst performing minister in 2012 was deemed by widespread consensus to be the Education Minister Hekia Parata. As a relatively new MP and minister, Parata had risen sharply as a political star, and was seen as a potential future prime minister. But she presided over a large number of embarrassing education issues since her appointment to that portfolio in late 2011. The most damaging to National – and arguably the most detrimental single issue in National's first four years in office – was her proposal to increase class sizes. This was announced in the government's budget and poorly sold to the public, especially because the wrong figures were originally used. Parata eventually backed down from defending the extremely unpopular policy and announced that it would not proceed, with many commentators speculating that the Prime Minister had forced the U‐turn.</p>
         
         <p>Unfortunately for Parata and National, there were plenty more humiliations. Next, the minister led a major plan to close, merge and build schools in earthquake‐ravaged Christchurch, which again was viewed as a mishandled process, upsetting parents and school communities. A new pay system for teachers was launched called Novopay, heralded as the most sophisticated payroll programme available. It immediately failed badly, leading to continued overpayments, underpayments and non‐payments for staff. Then, at the end of the year, the chief executive of the Ministry of Education resigned after only a short period in the job.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0007"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0007-title"> Dotcom saga</h2>
         
         <p>The most extraordinary political controversy of the year involved a previously obscure German Internet tycoon resident in New Zealand. Kim Schmitz, who renamed himself ‘Kim Dotcom’, ran a highly profitable online storage system that raised the ire of American authorities who accused him of copyright infringement, among other felonies. On 20 January New Zealand police raided his mansion with helicopters and a squad of 76 officers, apparently at the behest of the United States government. The saga became highly controversial for numerous reasons. First, Dotcom released details of donations he had made to government minister and Act party leader, John Banks. The contributions had been made for Banks' Auckland mayoralty campaign, and the details suggested that that the politician had arranged the donations to circumvent disclosure in a way that was probably illegal. A police investigation was carried out and Banks escaped prosecution on a technicality, but there were widespread calls for the minister to resign. For many, it showed how the electoral finance laws could be abused.</p>
         
         <p>It also became apparent that the police raid on Dotcom and the seizure of his property had been carried out illegally. This was the first of many legal setbacks in the case for extraditing Dotcom to the United States. By the end of the year, Dotcom was still in the country and his lawyers had won many battles against the government.</p>
         
         <p>The government's external intelligence agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), became embroiled in the debacle when it became apparent that it had illegally spied on Dotcom in the lead‐up to his arrest. The GCSB is not allowed to spy on New Zealand citizens and residents, and Dotcom's court proceedings uncovered this lapse. There appeared to be an attempted cover‐up of this detail, and the episode called into question the role and trustworthiness of the government spies.</p>
         
         <p>Prime Minister John Key became heavily enmeshed in the affair. After all, Dotcom was a resident in Key's own electorate. Key had sought to distance himself from the saga, and was evasive about his knowledge of Dotcom and the police and spy agency operations against him. However, as prime minister, Key had ministerial oversight of the spy agency, and it was later revealed that he had been briefed (to some degree) about the matter – something he had originally denied. Also under pressure to remove or reprimand Banks (a minister in his government, but also holding a crucial vote in parliament) Key was reluctant to even comment, and was criticised for failing even to read the damming police report on what had happened. On the issue of the illegal spying, Key dismissed it as simply a case of a ‘brain fade’ occurring in the agency rather than anything more systemic.</p>
         
         <p>The other major scandal involving alleged impropriety related to the awarding of a contract to SkyCity, the company that operated New Zealand's largest casino. The auditor general's office announced in June that it was launching an investigation into the government's decision‐making process that had led to the awarding of a tender to SkyCity to build a national convention centre in Auckland. The company had made an unusual proposal that involved building a convention centre at no cost to the government, but expecting in return to have its gambling license extended and its limitation on gambling machines significantly lifted. Government opponents and many commentators labelled this as cronyism and criticised the policy‐making processes.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0008"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0008-title"> Economy</h2>
         
         <p>Sluggishness defined the 2012 economy, with low economic growth and activity throughout the year. The government had to contend with a reduced tax take, and therefore its projected return to budget surplus by 2014 appeared to be in danger. However, the government had built its reputation and branding on the issue of sound economic management, and therefore it appeared obsessed with making sure that the targeted surplus would be achieved. This led to some questionable tax increases being announced towards the end of the year – petrol and road user taxes went up significantly, which commentators labelled ‘fiscal tinkering’.</p>
         
         <p>Employment became the electorate's biggest economic concern, especially when the unemployment rate hit a 13‐year high of 7.3 per cent. The currency exchange rate was also controversially elevated, with the high New Zealand dollar making exporters suffer. The government managed to avoid much of the blame for the state of the economy with opinion polls showing that voters saw global economic conditions as the main reason for the ongoing slump. Nonetheless there was a noticeable return to focus on traditional material political issues such as inequality, housing affordability and child poverty.</p>
         
         <p>The most controversial economic issue of the year turned out to be that of land sales to foreigners. A Chinese conglomerate, Shanghai Pengxin, was given approval to purchase a large group of dairy farms, leading to a national debate about foreign investment and land.</p>
         
         <p>State sector reform continued to be a focus of the government. Reforms of local councils were introduced, which imposed a much tighter central government grip on council expenditure and decisions. Within the core public service there was continued restructuring. Several government departments were merged into the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade was subjected to considerable downsizing, which led to a bitter public revolt from diplomats.</p>

         <p>National's strongest performers in 2012 were Tony Ryall, Paula Bennett, Judith Collins, Gerry Brownlee, Chris Finlayson and Steven Joyce. There were also notable promotions for Simon Bridges, Chris Tremain and Amy Adams – all occurring in a ministerial reshuffle in April (necessitated by the earlier resignation of Nick Smith). Adams became the Minister for the Environment, Tremain was promoted to cabinet as Minister of Internal Affairs and Bridges became Minister of Consumer Affairs (outside of cabinet).</p>
         
         <p>Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson resigned from her portfolio in November when the royal commission of inquiry released its damning report into a mining tragedy that had occurred in the Pike River mine two years earlier. The report found that the Department of Labour had contributed to a litany of failures in its regulation of mining, contributing to the disaster that killed 29 men. Wilkinson was replaced as Minister of Labour by Chris Finlayson.</p>
         
         <p>There were lighter moments in National's torrid year. John Key had his usual media moments of controversy – he caused offence by mocking a radio DJ's ‘gay’ red shirt, ate maggots on stage in a cooking competition, attempted the ‘Gangnam style’ dance, was reported as saying that football star David Beckham was ‘thick as batshit’ and joked about being eaten by cannibalistic Maori.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0010"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0010-title"> Labour Party</h2>
         
         <p>Labour's performance in 2012 was underwhelming. Despite the government being vulnerable on many fronts and having to battle numerous scandals, Labour appeared unable to take advantage of this. Much of the problem stemmed from its leadership transition and the continued uncertainty about new leader David Shearer's ability. Shearer was a particularly poor communicator in the media, appearing inarticulate, indecisive and bland. Speculation built up throughout the year – especially on Labour‐aligned blogs – about a coming leadership change. The person identified as the challenger was David Cunliffe, who did little to reassure his leader that his position was safe. Eventually this led Shearer to demote Cunliffe – an action that had the effect of bolstering the leader's image by showing that he could be decisive and assertive. Shearer's leadership was much more secure by the end of the year, but questions remained about his ability. For instance, in one end‐of‐the‐year opinion poll, voters gave Shearer a mark of 4.8 out of 10.</p>
         
         <p>Part of Shearer's problem was that few voters knew what he stood for. This was also a problem for the wider party, but some serious policy development continued throughout 2012, and the party began pushing a much stronger economic interventionist line, epitomised by the use of the promise to be a more ‘active government’. The new finance spokesperson, David Parker, was effectively rewriting the party's economic policy, and was widely praised by commentators for his performance. Other stronger performers included new MPs Andrew Little and David Clark. Also notably successful was Louisa Wall, who introduced a private members' bill to parliament to legalise same‐sex marriage. She assiduously lobbied across party lines, and was partly responsible for the first reading of the legislation, receiving an endorsement of 80 out of 120 votes, pushing the legislation toward being passed in the following year.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12024-sec-0011"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12024-sec-0011-title"> Other parties</h2>
         
         <p>The Green Party continued to assert itself as the third biggest party, often appearing to supplant Labour as the main party of opposition in 2012. Certainly Green co‐leader Russel Norman had a very successful year, making the most of Labour's frequent invisibility on various issues. Norman was particularly assertive in projecting his and the Green Party's command of economic issues. The party has made particular efforts in recent years to be taken seriously as a mainstream political party with a credible economic policy. However, some of this progress was undone when Norman advocated a policy of quantitative easing (or ‘printing money’) as a solution for economic problems.</p>
         
         <p>The New Zealand First party was relatively quiet in 2012, but had to endure a minor scandal when one of its MPs, Brendan Horan, was alleged to have stolen money from his dying mother. Party leader Winston Peters eventually acted to limit the fallout by forcing Horan out of the party. The exiled MP remained in parliament as an independent.</p>
         
         <p>After a tumultuous 2011, the Mana Party's sole MP, Hone Harawira, was also uncharacteristically quiet during 2012. He did, however, get arrested by the police when he was involved in a minor protest – the first arrest of a serving MP in living memory.</p>
