         <p>During 2006, a major reshuffle of the Rodriguez Zapatero cabinet took place: three ministers departed and another changed post. The Minister of Home Affairs replaced the Minister of Defence, who, disappointed at a number of cabinet decisions, left the Government at same time as the Minister of Education and Science. The Spokesman of the Socialist Group in Parliament was appointed to the post of Minister of Home Affairs. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism was replaced as a consequence of his nomination as Socialist candidate for the Presidency of the Catalonian regional government. His job went to the former socialist major of the city of Barcelona.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In 2006, Spanish politics was still underpinned by a growing economy. Unemployment decreased, and there was increased growth and productivity, with the stock exchange index, IBEX, reaching new highs. The fairly favourable international scenario, with world economic growth broadly holding up and, in particular, a clear recovery in the euro area, has seen a significant improvement in the contribution of the external sector to the expansion of the Spanish economy. The recovery in manufacturing output did not, however, significantly boost job creation in that sector, meaning that construction and services once again experienced most growth in employment. In sum, the Spanish economy continues to be essentially underpinned by very robust national demand. Moreover, the improved contribution of the external sector appears to have resulted more from the vigour of the international environment than to Spanish price‐competitiveness. The continuation of strong economic growth has not, therefore, been accompanied by a reduction in the imbalances observed in previous years – namely a high external deficit and a persistent inflation differential with the euro area. In addition, the European Commission was unhappy with the Government's interference in a proposed takeover of the Spanish energy company ENDESA.</p>
         
         <p>Hence, other issues created more political debate in 2006. One of the central debates dealt with the ‘permanent’ truce declared by the terrorist group ETA on 22 March, after which the Prime Minister announced a process of dialogue with the terrorists. Meanwhile, unofficial sources revealed that talks had already taken place between members of the Basque Socialist Party and ETA in the run up to the declaration – talks that were roundly criticised by associations of terrorist victims and by the Popular Party, thereby ending any hope of a bipartisan approach to the issue. At the end of the year, just when Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero was telling the nation about the positive atmosphere the truce had created, a bomb planted by ETA exploded in the parking lot of Madrid airport, killing two people.</p>
         
         <p>The reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia approved by its regional parliament at the end of 2005 was another of the issues that captured national political attention. The new Statute of Autonomy defines the rights and obligations of Catalonia's citizens, covers the political institutions of the Catalan nationality, and their competences and relations with the Spanish State, as well as the financing of the Government of Catalonia. Although a majority of the parties seemed to agree that reforms were needed, there was less agreement on what they should be. The Popular Party (PP) constituted the main opposition to the draft covering Catalonia's basic institutional regulations, while the Socialist Party had problems with the financial autonomy granted by the Statute. However, the biggest problem was the definition of Catalonia as a <i>nation</i>– a definition that would have collided with the Spanish Constitution. For that reason, the Statute's preamble acknowledged that the Catalan people saw themselves as a nation, but in its second article, it went no further than recognising the reality of Catalonia as a <i>nationality</i>.
         </p>
         
         <p>The new statute was approved by the Congress, but, unprecedentedly, did not receive the approval of both main parliamentary parties even though this was forthcoming for changes to other statutes introduced in 2006. The Popular Party did not approve the law in Parliament and campaigned against it in the referendum held in Catalonia in the early summer. PP also petitioned the Constitutional Court against the Statute. The same initiative was taken by several regional governments and by the Ombusdman. These attempts proved unsuccessful, however, and the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia was approved by referendum by its citizens on 18 June 2006, replacing the Statute of Sau, which dated from 1979. Paradoxically, apart from PP, all the parties agreed with the final text of the Statute approved by the Lower Chamber and called for a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum – except, that is, a party that was to begin with actually a member of the government of Catalonia: the radical Catalan nationalist party, <i>Esquerra Republicana de Cataluña</i> (ERC). The referendum resulted in an unexpectedly poor turnout (around 49 per cent of the electorate), although the ‘yes’ vote was just over 73 per cent.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Socialist Government focused on social matters – mainly immigration policy, emphasising security and regulating immigration coming from Morocco. The previous year's amnesty granted to illegal immigrants the year before produced different effects. The most important in quantitative terms was the so‐called ‘pull effect’ attracting other potential immigrants from many different parts of the world. During 2006, indeed, Spain received almost 40 per cent of all the immigrants that arrived in Europe, with those coming from Africa by boats (<i>pateras</i>) making a big impact on public opinion because of the inhuman conditions they had to endure. Other European governments and the Commission, who were none too pleased about the amnesty, were apparently slow to help when the Spanish Government asked for their assistance.
         </p>
         
         <p>During 2006 Spanish politics witnessed the further breakdown of bipartisan consensus on three important public policies: foreign affairs, terrorism and decentralisation. It also saw a large number of demonstrations against the Government on the issue of terrorism.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> The regional elections in Catalonia</h2>
         
         <p>The Catalonian elections were dominated by the approval of the new Statute of Autonomy. The incumbent president of the regional government, P. Maragall, did not run and was replaced by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, José Montilla. However, the Catalonian Socialist Party (PSOE‐PSC) did not win the election; instead, the winner was the centre‐right regionalist party, <i>Convergencia i Unió</i> (CiU), with 31.5 per cent of the total votes cast and 48 seats – well short of an absolute majority. It took a week for the Government to form and, as happened after previous elections (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Delgado &amp; López Nieto 2004</a></span>), the Socialists and the radical Catalan Nationalist Party (ERC), together with the ecologist and communist alliance, ICV, formed a coalition.
