         <p>When the year started, most observers expected it to be politically charged, but few anticipated just how different the partisan landscape would look by its end. Most attention was focused on the governing Liberals for in the summer of 2002 they forced their leader, Jean Chrétien, to announce that he would retire in early 2004. This move ensured their internal battles over the party's leadership would finally come to a head. The supporters of Paul Martin, the deposed Finance Minister (see the entry on Canada in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>), continued to develop their strangleholds on constituency party associations in which the leadership vote would be contested. The result was systematically to weaken his opponents and drive them, one‐by‐one, from the contest. By the time the every‐member vote was held in September, only one cabinet minister was left standing against him, and Martin steamrollered to the greatest victory ever recorded in a national party leadership contest. The long process left the party deeply divided and many of the major figures from the 10‐year Chrétien Government suddenly found themselves on the outside.
         </p>
         
         <p>The vote to select bound delegates to the Liberal's November leadership convention was held in September. Its result left the convention vote a formality and Martin recognized as the prime minister in waiting. With the prospect of a half‐year hiatus in the country's leadership, Chrétien rethought his plan to remain in office until February and resigned soon after the party's convention vote, ending a 40‐year career in national politics. So Martin achieved the prize that he had long sought (and which had twice been denied to his father) and formed a government on 12 December. The core ministry remained the same size as Chrétien’s, but the number of ministers of state grew and the many parliamentary secretaries had their status enhanced by being sworn into the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, a position previously reserved for ministers. Of the 28 members of the new cabinet, only 10 had served in the Chrétien Government. This was widely understood as an effort by Martin to distance his government from his predecessor's in anticipation of an early election, and a signal that the Liberal Party had, once‐again, been transformed from within. Given that Martin had been a dominant figure in that government for much of its life, it remained to be seen if the electorate would agree.</p>
         
         <p>While all this internal conflict was troubling the government party, the opposition was also reshaping itself. The New Democratic Party chose its new leader by an every‐member vote, the first in the social democrats’ history. Members rejected two of its most prominent, established Members of Parliament in favour of a dynamic local politician from the heart of Toronto, the country's largest city. The party's two previous leaders had been women drawn from the peripheries and this choice indicated that the party was determined to re‐establish itself as the serious contender for central Canadian, left‐of‐centre votes it had been before the 1993 collapse of the old party system. Meanwhile the Progressive Conservatives, the other old party that had been devastated in 1993, were also engaged in a leadership contest. In March, it chose Peter MacKay, a young MP, on the fourth ballot of a vigorously fought convention. In the process, MacKay pledged to maintain the party as an independent national political force.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3%20#t4" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>This alignment left the party system much as it had been and suggested that, even divided, the Liberals were well positioned to cruise to election victories for the foreseeable future. Urged on by both partisans and influential voices in the community, the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives engaged in a series of talks about cooperation and then suddenly, in October, their leaders announced they had reached an agreement to merge their parties. Separate membership votes in both parties overwhelmingly ratified the agreement in early December, and a new Conservative Party of Canada came into being in the last days of the year. This marriage appears to have been rushed to take advantage of the sweeping changes in a law regarding party fundraising and spending. The new provisions, pushed hard by the outgoing Chrétien Government, limit the source and size of private gifts to political parties, but have compensated them by sharply increasing the amount of state money being poured into the parties. The new united Conservative Party was in place just in time to take advantage of the first round of these new subsidies. Not all Progressive Conservatives were happy with MacKay's abrupt about‐face – the former leader and ex‐Prime Minister Joe Clark likened it to a death – but most appeared to accept the decision and recognized that, for the first time since the 1980s, the right was now in a position to challenge the Liberals.</p>
         
         <p>The year 2003 was also an unusually busy year for electoral politics in the provinces with contests in eight of the ten: the government was returned in five (in three by very narrow margins), while the opposition won three, including Ontario and Quebec, the two largest. When all the dust had settled, the New Democrats held two provinces, Liberals three and the Progressive Conservatives five. With little or no connection between these Liberal parties, and the provincial Progressive Conservatives showing no sign of affiliating with the new national Conservative Party, the distance between federal and provincial political organizations and their politics seemed greater than ever.</p>
         
         <p>Canadians have long regarded parties as essentially private organizations and have rarely questioned the single‐member plurality electoral system. Indeed it was the accepted logic of Duverger's law that convinced the Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives that they needed to abandon their separate existence and merge. Therefore it was a considerable surprise that electoral reform emerged as a major agenda item during the year. As with other notable policy departures, this one grew from the ground up as a consequence of initiatives in several of the provinces: Prince Edward Island appointed a judge to inquire into the electoral system, Quebec announced that its new government would be introducing change, New Brunswick launched a nine‐person commission on legislative democracy, Ontario established a bureaucratic secretariat on democracy and British Columbia created a 160‐person (drawn at random from the voter's list) Citizens’ Assembly. In all cases, their mandates were to evaluate the continued use of the single‐member plurality system and, in a couple of instances, explicitly directed to recommend a more proportional system.</p>
         
         <p>It is not clear why electoral reform suddenly became a major issue. In part it may reflect the anxiety of politicians over continually falling turnout rates and the failure of women and other traditionally under‐represented groups to increase their numbers in the legislatures, but it may simply also be that the idiosyncrasies of the system have caught up with it. With too many cases of ‘wrong winners’ (parties winning election despite not winning a plurality of the vote) and oppositions reduced to tiny numbers in recent years, the first‐past‐the‐post system is increasingly seen as unfair and illegitimate. While no province had moved to reform its electoral system by year's end, considerable momentum for change existed and may well take hold in at least some of the provinces. And given the power of the demonstration effect in the federation, any success is likely to spread.</p>
         
         <p>The year started with the Canadian economy looking the strongest of those in the G7, and the dying Chrétien Government took advantage of this to launch an expansive budget with spending planned for several years into the future. It soon turned into a year of natural disasters that preoccupied most ordinary citizens with day‐to‐day concerns. The SARS outbreak in the Toronto area was second only to that in Asia: 375 people were infected and 44 died. West Nile Fever infected over 600 people, nine of whom died – the majority in Saskatchewan. In British Columbia, uncontrollable forest fires did unusual amounts of damage, as they burned right into the suburbs of the province's third largest city. The cattle industry on the prairies saw the border shut to them after a case of Mad Cow disease was discovered in Alberta. A major hurricane flattened the east coast city of Halifax and most of Ontario suffered through the worst power blackout in North American history. In the face of these onslaughts, most governments struggled to maintain public confidence.</p>
         
         <p>Canada's most important external relationship is with the United States and the war in Iraq clouded it during the year. The government avoided any commitment for as long as possible and then effectively handed over its final decision to the United Nations. That left it offside when the Americans finally invaded Iraq. The refusal to take part in the military campaign was quite popular with the electorate, though it inevitably strained the relationship between two countries already struggling with border security issues. It was clear that Chrétien did not have a close relationship with the American president and that one of Martin's first tasks as the new prime minister would have to be an effort to refurbish that link. Doing so in an election run‐up period would be a delicate task.</p>
