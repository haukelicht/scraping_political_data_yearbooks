         <p>In 2015 the government of Matteo Renzi continued to pursue an ambitious agenda of policy change and constitutional reform, but encountered increasingly strong opposition both from opposition parties and from those within his own party who saw his path as too centrist. In addition to disputes over the constitution, political debate was dominated by efforts to resolve economic problems – especially unemployment – and increasing immigration pressures.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Presidential elections</h3>
            
            <p>The year 2015 began with the election of a successor to outgoing 89 year‐old President Giorgio Napolitano, who had announced intention to resignation in his 2014 year‐end speech. His formal resignation on 14 January triggered the formal process of presidential selection involving joint meetings of both parliamentary chambers plus delegates of each of the country's regions. As the party holding the prime ministership and the largest parliamentary delegation, the Democratic Party (PD) entered the process with the capacity to play a pivotal role in the selection process. Many in the party also felt the need to reverse the setback the party had received during the presidential election process of 2013 when the failure of two successive PD‐backed candidates led to a deadlock that was resolved only when then‐incumbent Napolitano expressed a reluctant willingness to continue in office at least for a limited period. (Napolitano's decision to stand for re‐election reversed a longstanding tradition of one‐term presidencies.)</p>
            
            <p>Matteo Renzi, PD leader and Italian Prime Minister, defied expectations by refusing to negotiate with the opposition Forza Italia (FI) of Silvio Berlusconi, instead reaching unanimous consent within his own party and then pursuing the support of the party's junior coalition partners, the New Centre Right‐Union of the Centre (NCD‐UDC) and Civic Choice (SC). Renzi's decision provoked a furore from within ranks of the FI and above all from Berlusconi himself, who felt that Renzi had betrayed the cooperation in the constitutional reform process during 2014. Berlusconi ultimately proved unable to block the election of PD candidate Sergio Mattarella, a former senator of the Italy's once dominant Christian Democracy (DC) and subsequently a Constitutional Court judge. The first three rounds of voting (requiring a two‐thirds majority) produced no clear outcome because Mattarella was not yet officially a candidate. Then, in the fourth rounds of voting when simple majority was enough, Matterella was elected with 665 votes out of 1,009 (65.9 per cent). This ample consent suggests that a significant number of FI electors voted for Mattarella despite Berlusconi's call to withhold support.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Regional elections</h3>
            
            <p>On 31 May, elections took place in seven regions comprising nearly 40 per cent of Italy's population. The results did not change the balance between centre‐right and centre‐left. The right‐wing Lega Nord (LN) held on to Veneto and the centre‐right FI gained control of Liguria from PD, but at the same time PD displaced FI in Campania and the centre‐left retained control in four other regions: Marche, Tuscany, Umbria and Puglia.</p>
            
            <p>Results in four regions were unambiguous. The country's highest vote share – more than 50 per cent of the vote and 27 per cent ahead of the second‐place candidate – was obtained in Veneto by incumbent president Luca Zaia of the LN. Toscana re‐elected its incumbent president Enrico Rossi with 48 per cent of votes. PD candidates also won by comfortable margins in Marche and Puglia.</p>
            
            <p>Results in the other three regions were much closer. In many ways the most surprising outcome was the near‐defeat of PD incumbent president Catiuscia Marini in the central region of Umbria, whose significant drop in support from 2010 was a significant departure for this small, traditonally left‐leaning region.</p>
            
            <p>The most salient political outcome occurred in Liguria, a region traditionally slightly biased towards the left. Here, the highly divisive PD candidate was defeated by the centre‐right candidate, Member of the European Parliament and FI ‘coordinator’ Giovanni Toti. This result was the by‐product of an extremely contested selection of the PD candidate and of the following splits. The internal PD challenger in the primary selection, the former powerful trade union (CGIL) leader, Sergio Cofferati, contested the result of the primary for a series of malpractices and wrongdoings, and left the party leading a concurrent list with other PD splinters. The PD divisions eased the victory of the centre‐right candidate.</p>
            
            <p>While Liguria passed from left to right, a shift in the opposite direction occurred in Campania, where the highly outspoken and highly divisive PD mayor of Salerno, Vincenzo De Luca, defeated the centre‐right incumbent, Stefano Caldoro. The victory, however, raised many concerns within the PD because a trial pending against De Luca raised the possibility of his forced resignation on the basis of new anti‐corruption law that suspends officials with pending trials. De Luca's suspension on these grounds was quickly overturned by a court, however, and with full‐hearted support by the national party leader Matteo Renzi he returned to the position.</p>
            
            <p>Overall the results of the regional elections suggest several important developments. First, the LN surpassed FI in the centre‐north, gaining a dominant position on the right in that region. Second, the PD did not repeat its the brilliant result in the 2014 European elections. Its support fell even in some regions where it was victorious (Umbria and Marche) and it found itself completely unable to gain a foothold in the Veneto region where its candidate scored very poorly despite open support by the national party. PD's candidate selection procedures also produced deep internal quarrels in several regions. Third, the 5 Star Movement (M5S), campaigning for the first time in most of the regional‐level elections, had mixed results. It gained respectable second‐place results Marche and Puglia and obtained a strong third‐place position in Liguria (narrowly behind PD), but its support in other regions fell below its level of support in previous national elections. Finally, turnout decreased quite dramatically from the previous election, with reductions ranging between 9 and 13 percentage points depending on the region.</p>

         <p>During 2015 the splits and exits from the parties in parliament continued and even increased. All parties, except LN, experienced some outflow. Within PD, two groups of dissenters left the party, criticising it and the Renzi government as too moderate. The first group was led by Pippo Civati, a rising star within PD who had launched with Renzi a series of meetings on PD party renewal at the Leopolda Railway Station in Florence and had gained public attention by competing for the party secretary position in the primary 2013. The exit of Civati was particularly relevant because many considered him to be the most serious potential challenger to Renzi in the years to come. A second group of deputies, including a former vice‐minister of economics, quit the PD in October in opposition to constitutional reform proposals.</p>
         
         <p>In July, FI lost a group of MPs led by Denis Verdini, Berlusconi's former <i>bras droite</i>, who did not share Berlusconi's increasingly radical opposition to the Renzi government, which erupted when Renzi excluded FI from the presidential nomination process at the beginning of the year. Verdini and his new parliamentary group – the Liberal Popular Alliance‐Autonomies (<i>Alleanza Liberpolpolare‐Autonomie</i>, ALA) – offered increasingly open support for the government. Though Renzi benefitted from ALA support in the Senate, where the government majority is quite thin, some within PD expressed reluctance to develop close ties with a politician formerly with such close ties to Berlusconi and with several pending judicial cases.
         </p>
         
         <p>The shrinking of the M5S parliamentary group resulted from expulsions of internal opponents rather than voluntary exits. This tightening of internal loyalty exercised by the two external and uncontested leaders (Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio) went together with some moves towards the party institutionalisation. The outspoken charismatic leader, Grillo, in fact decided ‘to move a step aside’ and launch a five‐member executive of young MPs to informally run the party. This investiture disturbed the movement's dogmatic (and illusory) equalitarian rule of ‘one equals one’, and opened it up to the idea of a more traditional party structure. Although this change did not create particular concern within the party, it is highly probable that it will have a significant impact on the movement's internal dynamics in the near future.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12133-sec-0070-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>A major revision of the Italian Constitution started on 13 October with preliminary approval in the Senate. This first passage is the beginning of a series of steps necessary to implement constructional changes. The new text must pass twice in both chambers without any amendments, and no more than six months can lapse between the two votes. Moreover, the Constitution's own amendment procedure gives a relatively small number of MPs or regional councils the right to insist that amendments are ratified by a nationwide referendum.</p>
         
         <p>The proposed reform would affect 95 constitutional articles and is by far the largest and most profound alteration since the Constitution came into force in 1948. Yet although the proposal included many significant changes (establishment of a 60 per cent super‐majority requirement for the election of the president, removal of constitutional protections for the sub‐regional ‘province’ level of government, sharper delineation of areas of competence between the national and regional government and lower turnout requirements for some referendums and popular initiatives), the political debate was almost wholly consumed by the question of the radical transformation of Italy's Senate.</p>
         
         <p>Renzi acknowledged the importance of the change by introducing the topic of parliamentary reform during his own investiture speech in the Senate in February 2014 and proposing, with more than a hint of ribaldry, that the Senate agree to replace itself with a smaller and less powerful body.</p>
         
         <p>The amendments Renzi ultimately proposed would fundamentally change both the Senate's function and its composition. It would remove the symmetric bicameralism between the lower and upper houses, restricting votes of confidence in the government to the lower house alone and sharply limiting the Senate's absolute veto to cover only some types of laws related to regional, national and European Union institutions. On other legislation, a Senate decision to veto or amend would return the legislation to the lower house for reconsideration but would not prevent passage of the laws over its objections. The Senate reform would also reduce the number of members from 315 senators elected directly to 100 senators chosen indirectly. According to the reform, each regional council would appoint several of its own members to the Senate (between two and 14 in rough proportion to a region's population) for a total of 74; each of the 21 regional councils would also appoint one mayor from within their region. The remaining five would be selected by the President of the Republic.</p>
         
         <p>At the centre of the rift was the question of second‐order elections rather than direct popular mandate. There was a general consensus on the elimination of the Senate's power of investiture and the perfectly symmetrical bicameralism even among those who believed traditional checks and balances required a second chamber to better offset government activity. The bigger concern was that the proposed process of second‐order nomination would not avail the Senate of enough legitimacy to act as an effective balancing power <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the government.
         </p>
         
         <p>The process by which the project of constitutional reform was activated by the Prime Minister bewildered some components of his party. In fact, Renzi's decision to seek an accord with Berlusconi's FI before reaching a consensus within his own party was a key factor that led some PD MPs to oppose the reform, and above all the second‐order election of the senators.</p>

         <p>The government devoted most of its energy to finding a way out of Italy's prolonged economic crisis. The government's most important tool in this effort was its implementation of the 2014 Jobs Act related to companies’ fiscal deduction for new occupations. This provision proved quite effective in giving firms the incentive to transform temporary contracts into long‐term contracts, but also sparked concerns that the effects would vanish once the window for the act's generous fiscal deductions closed at the end of 2015. Outside of the changes in contract length, the act appeared to create few <i>new</i> jobs.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another critical intervention by the government involved the legal transformation of large <i>Popolari</i> or ‘People's Banks’ (a hybrid banking model with aspects of cooperatives and traditional banks) into share‐holding companies. This overdue change was prepared precipitously because of the critical financial balance of the banks. The subsequent near‐collapse of four of these banks led to government intervention to rescue and restructure them, but the government's involvement faced close scrutiny because the vice‐president of one the four banks (Banca Etruria) was the father of the Minister for Constitutional Reforms, Maria Elena Boschi, the pivotal figure in the constitutional amendment process and a close ally of Prime Minister Renzi. Although investigation cleared Boschi of any wrongdoing, the appearance of conflict of interest produced an outcry from those who lost money in the banks’ crisis and negatively affected the government's carefully cultivated image of independence from economic and financial interests.
         </p>
         
         <p>In terms of international politics, the government sharpened its calls for more flexibility from the European Commission on debt and deficit targets for Italy's state budget and more EU‐level cooperation to manage the Italy's increased immigration inflow. Although this unconventional <i>modus operandi</i> was not well received in Brussels, it did appear to direct increased attention to the Italian government's concerns. The other intended audience for this aggressive attitude was Italy's growing Eurosceptic constituency and the efforts can be understood as an example of the ‘light populism’ frequently introduced by Renzi into the political agenda.
         </p>
         
         <p>M5S consistently expressed the most vocal opposition to government legislative efforts. Grillo's movement contested almost all government provisions not only with opposition in parliament, but also through more unconventional means and attempts at filibustering. Contrary to the expectations of many pollsters, M5S kept and even increased its support within the electorate, coming close at times to the 30 per cent hurdle. Its antagonistic posture, coupled with some attractive proposals such as the universal minimum wage, received widespread support and Italy's reservoir of highly dissatisfied voters remains extremely large.</p>
         
         <p>The other opposition party, LN, attracted many disillusioned FI voters and others with strong anti‐immigrant sentiment. LN averaged between 12 and 14 per cent support throughout 2015, matching and sometimes surpassing FI. The competition for the leadership in the centre‐right is now open, and LN's young leader, Matteo Salvini, has become a ubiquitous figure in political television broadcasting, directly challenging Berlusconi's once pre‐eminent role.</p>
