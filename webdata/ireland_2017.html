         <p>The minority government eventually formed in 2016, which was based on a confidence‐and‐supply deal with Fianna Fáil (FF), was not predicted to last very long—and it did not. However, the government did not collapse because FF withdrew its support, or because some of the independent TDs (i.e. MPs) within the government left. Rather, it was the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny who stood down. Though he was 66 years of age, this was not a chosen retirement. Kenny's Fine Gael (FG) party was increasingly impatient with poor polling numbers, especially after the loss of seats in the 2016 election. In February, he failed to explain satisfactorily the government's position on a series of Garda (police) scandals, and soon after he indicated that he would make an announcement regarding his future when he returned from the traditional St Patrick's Day visit to the United States, much to the relief of the younger members of his party. However, after a more successful visit to the United States than was expected, he announced that he would remain in place until the issues of Brexit and the collapsed executive in Northern Ireland were sorted out. As these were effectively indefinite problems, members of his party were increasingly concerned that he might never voluntarily retire. Publicly they said the Taoiseach deserved time and space to make his own decision. Privately they said he needed to go soon. Eventually he succumbed to pressure, and FG organized a leadership election with several electoral colleges comprising national elected representatives, local elected representatives and ordinary members.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12228-sec-0020-title"> Cabinet report</h2>
         
         <p>On 14 June, Leo Varadkar was nominated as Taoiseach in the Dáil (lower house) and then formally appointed by the President (see Political party report below). It was not a given that he would obtain the requisite numbers in the Dáil, as FF could have voted against his election. But it preferred not to cause the certain general election that would have ensued. Still, the support for Varadkar in his vote for Taoiseach was down on the minority that had elected Kenny a year earlier because two independents who had supported Kenny refused to vote for Varadkar (though they claim to vote for the government on a case‐by‐case basis).</p>
         
         <p>Varadkar's cabinet choices were cautious, perhaps reflecting the precarious position in which he fund himself. He made few ministerial changes. Varadkar had probably promised to leave a number of ministers <i>in situ</i> during the leadership contest. As well as Kenny, the long‐time Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, also chose to retire. Varadkar tried to sack one minister, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who was thought to be underperforming in the Department of Enterprise. She was reported to have protested against her dismissal, and was eventually allowed to remain in cabinet, albeit in a junior ministerial position.

         <p>The FG leadership election caused by the resignation of Kenny was contested by two men, Varadkar, Minister for Social Protection, and Simon Coveney, Minister for Housing and Planning. Varadkar was the younger of the two, just 36, openly gay, and the son of an Indian father and an Irish mother. Coveney was the more traditional of the two. In his mid‐40s he was from a wealthy background, and the son of a former minister and married with children. He reflected what a FG leader would have usually looked like. His campaign might have attempted to suggest he was a family values candidate compared with Varadkar. However, the Varadkar campaign was much more effective and within days of starting he had effectively amassed enough support from the parliamentary party to win the contest. (The electoral college was heavily weighted in favour of the parliamentarians.) Coveney fought on regardless, winning the membership ballot convincingly, but losing the overall contest. On 2 June, Varadkar was announced as the new leader of FG.</p>
         
         <p>Earlier in the year the small Social Democrats party suffered a setback when one of the three founding TDs and its joint leader, Stephen Donnelly, resigned the party to join FF, where he became Brexit spokesman. He felt that the Social Democrats was not making an impact, and that his joining FF would be a better way to achieve change.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12228-sec-0040-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>One of the more significant early announcements was to indicate that a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment to the constitution would take place in 2018. The amendment, introduced in 1983, imposed a ban on abortion. As a result of the ban, many thousands of Irish women travelled to the UK each year to procure a termination. Several high‐profile cases highlighted the failure of constitutional provision, and abortion remained a political, if not a partisan, issue in the time since then. Successive governments avoided dealing with the issue, but the courts, both national and European, had forced an earlier government to legislate to allow for an abortion in extremely limited circumstances. That had caused a split in FG, and few parties were willing to take a lead on the issue of abortion.</p>
         
         <p>Varadkar's promise to hold a referendum was to come after a citizen's assembly had met to consider the issue. The assembly, an exercise in deliberative democracy, recommended repealing the amendment, and suggested a range of circumstances in which abortion should be allowed. These were much more liberal than expected. The report was then referred to an Oireachtas (parliamentary) committee, which reported at the end of the year. It, too, recommended repeal, and to many people's surprise also recommended legislating to allow for abortion without specified reasons up to 12 weeks. More surprising was that some conservative members of both FG and FF supported the committee's report.</p>
         
         <p>On becoming Taoiseach, Varadkar attempted to give a theme to his government. He suggested it would seek to create a ‘Republic of Opportunity’. In language consistent with others from the self‐styled liberal centre, such as Emmanuel Macron in France, he suggested that he would seek to reward hard work and the middle classes. He had previously courted controversy for a campaign against welfare fraud and was seen as more classically free market than Kenny. He was lucky in that he was taking over a country whose economy had seen significant growth. That growth continued unabated in 2017, though concerns remained that it was a two‐tracked growth, especially as much of the measurement of economic growth in Ireland is questionable on the basis that much of the economic activity is accounted by multinationals based in Ireland, which perhaps are engaged in less economic activity in Ireland than their accounts claim. The suggestion is that some activities are accounted for in Ireland in order to avail of a controversial low‐tax regime. However, the increased economic activity was also reflected in other measures such as the increased employment rate, the return of some emigrants who had left at the time of the Global Financial Crisis, and increased pay. This enabled the government to increase spending in the Budget, although it would be difficult to suggest that it was anything more than the incremental and partial reversal of some of the cuts due to austerity in the previous decade.</p>
         
         <p>Another major issue in Irish politics in 2017 was the continued uncertainty over Brexit. As the only country with a land border with the UK, and as a country with a significant economic trade with the UK, particularly in agricultural products, it was natural that Ireland was going to be one of the hardest hit of the EU‐27 from the UK's decision to leave the European Union. However, it was the possible impact on the uncertain position of Northern Ireland, and especially whether a ‘hard border’ would undermine the stalled Peace Process there. Ireland lobbied hard in Europe to make the border a central plank of European Union negotiations. In December, it appeared this lobbying had paid off. The UK made a commitment to no hard border. This was sold in Ireland as a great victory for Irish diplomacy, and a note of caution from the European Commission was largely ignored. It pointed out that the UK's commitment was inconsistent with its other stated aims of leaving the Customs Union, the Single Market and not being party of any form of customs union with the European Union. That did not make an impact in Ireland, where the government continued to rise in popularity.</p>
         
         <p>By the end of the year, FG's opinion poll results were in the early to mid‐30 points, up from 25 points in the 2016 election. It had a growing lead over FF, the second‐placed party. As such, one might think FG would have been glad of the opportunity to convert this poll lead into real seat changes in an election. In late November, FF and FG came close to precipitating a Christmas election. The Garda Siochána was once again the source of a political crisis, and this one centred on whether the Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Frances FitzGerald knew about a legal strategy of the Gardaí to discredit a whistleblower who had made claims of systematic wrongdoing in the police force. FitzGerald's response was unconvincing, leaving most people who thought about it to conclude that she was either complicit with the strategy or incompetent for not being aware of it. This was especially so as she was originally put in the position of Minister for Justice to sort out this problem.</p>
         
         <p>Taoiseach Varadkar strongly supported his deputy, but FF, deliberately or not, painted itself into a corner by calling for her resignation. For about a week it looked as if neither side would blink in this game of ‘chicken’, and an election seemed more likely than not. However, FitzGerald's poor media performances explaining her position were less than convincing, and support from her party ebbed. Eventually she was persuaded to step down, though still insisting that she had done nothing wrong. It was not clear whether FG could have maintained its poll lead in the context of an actual election, but there appeared to be relief on all sides the election was avoided. However, there was also a clear worsening of relations between FF and FG, increasing the likelihood of more such crises in future. We also saw all parties get on an election footing, especially in choosing candidates for an election.</p>
