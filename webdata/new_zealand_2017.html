         <p>The year 2017 was widely agreed as one of the most interesting in New Zealand politics for decades. This was because the general election campaign was a closely fought contest, containing a number of upsets. At the apex of this interesting year was the surge of support for the new opposition leader Jacinda Ardern, which then led to a change of government.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> By‐election: Mt Albert</h3>
            
            <p>Although Ardern became Prime Minister of New Zealand in October 2017, at the start of the year she was merely a backbench Labour Party MP who did not hold an electorate seat and was in Parliament only via her list position. But on 25 February she won the Mt Albert by‐election, which helped fuel her astonishing rise up the political ranks.</p>
            
            <p>Ardern achieved her victory in this safe Labour seat with ease: she won 77 per cent of the vote. However, voter turnout was low, and the main centre and right parties choose not to compete in the by‐election. Because Ardern was already a list MP, on taking up the electorate seat, her list position passed to the next available person on the Labour list: Raymond Huo. Four days after winning the by‐election, Ardern was elevated to the deputy leadership position in Labour, with the incumbent Annette King being pressured to step down in order to accommodate the rising star.</p>
            
            <p>The by‐election was caused by the resignation on 31 December 2016 of David Shearer, who had held the seat since 2009, when he won it in a by‐election to replace the departing former Prime Minister, Helen Clark. Shearer, who had also been leader of Labour (2011–2013), had left to take up a job as head the United Nations Mission in South Sudan.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> General election: September 2017</h3>
            
            <p>Most national elections create plenty of change, but the general election of 2017 was especially rambunctious. One political journalist summed it up as follows: ‘It's been a year of upheaval and tumultuous change in New Zealand politics. Election years are always brutal, but 2017 stands out as being relentlessly turbulent, with unexpected bombshells at every turn’ (Burr <span><a href="#epdy12229-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12229-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The turmoil of 2017 was not simply because the election led to a change of government, but because there were so many elements of change that occurred in the lead up to the vote. The most obvious upheavals involved a series of leadership changes, for a number of parties.</p>
            
            <p>At the start of the year, both the Prime Minister, Bill English, and Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Little, were new leaders. English had only just taken over from the highly popular John Key, who had been prime minister from 2008 until his unexpected resignation at the end of 2016. Little had been leader of Labour since the end of 2014, and was untested in an election. In fact, this election campaign was to be the first since 1975 in which both major parties were under new leadership.</p>
            
            <p>However, under Little's leadership Labour was struggling in the opinion polls, which finally led him to step down as leader on 1 August, just seven weeks before polling day. Little's obvious replacement was Ardern, his deputy. She was elected by her caucus, unopposed, as was new deputy, Kelvin Davis.</p>
            
            <p>It was this leadership change, more than anything else, that had an electrifying impact on the election. What became called ‘Jacindamania’, was a widespread enthusiasm for the new leader, leading to a significant jump in the opinion polls for her party. According to the Colmar Brunton opinion poll commissioned by the largest television channel, Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Labour jumped 13 percentage points in the survey after Ardern became leader – from 24 per cent to 37 per cent.</p>
            
            <p>With the sudden leadership change, Labour also had to change its advertising material during the last two months of the campaign. Its slogan of ‘A fresh approach’ was replaced by a new line of ‘Let's do this’, and the focus shifted much more onto Ardern as the popular salesperson for the party.</p>
            
            <p>Other leadership changes also took place during the campaign. Most notably, the Greens female co‐leader, Metiria Turei, resigned on 9 August after a controversy in which she confessed, first, to historic benefit fraud and then to a relatively minor electoral fraud.</p>
            
            <p>The intention of the benefit fraud admission was to highlight her party's new radical welfare policies for the election campaign. She gave a speech in which she said that when she was a single mother receiving a welfare benefit she was also reliant on income from flatmates, which she failed to declare to the authorities. Turei claimed that she had misled the authorities in order to feed her children.</p>
            
            <p>Turei's speech was highly polarizing, and her party instantly received a significant boost in the opinion polls. Ironically, this boost came at the expense of Labour under leader Little, which was seen as precipitating his replacement by Ardern.</p>
            
            <p>As the controversy evolved, however, public support for Turei and the Greens dropped. Holes started to appear in her story, and sympathy for her disappeared. Two of her own MPs, Kennedy Graham and David Clendon, even called for her to resign, declaring they would not be candidates if she remained as leader. Added to this, as the new leader of Labour, Ardern stated that she would not be willing to have Turei as a minister in a future government. Subsequently, Turei stood down, saying: ‘The scrutiny of my family has become unbearable.’ Her position as female co‐leader was left vacant, to be filled the following year.</p>
            
            <p>The next political party leader to step down was long‐term MP Peter Dunne, who had headed the United Future party for many years, and had been a minister in coalition governments led by both Labour and the National Party. He announced that he had changed his mind about competing in the election, citing his awareness of a ‘mood for change’ in his electorate. He was replaced as a candidate and as leader of his party on 23 August, and after an unsuccessful election, the party later voted to dissolve.</p>
            
            <p>The New Zealand First (NZF) party, led by maverick Winston Peters, was also subject to some turmoil during the campaign when Peters incurred a scandal over the leak of information about social security overpayments he had received. The news that he had been receiving payments he was not entitled to obviously hurt his campaign. But Peters was also able to paint the scandal as a smear campaign against him, especially as he had good reason to believe that his political opponents in government had illegally leaked the information in order to damage him.</p>
            
            <p>The NZF continued to position the party as close to the centre of the political spectrum as possible, while also campaigning to slash immigration numbers. It studiously avoided any indication of whether it would be preferable to go into a post‐election coalition with either Labour or National. The party also had an enigmatic advertising slogan asking: ‘Had enough?’</p>
            
            <p>The next most popular party was the new start‐up The Opportunities Party (TOP). Created in 2016 by wealthy economist and philanthropist Gareth Morgan, this party attempted to usurp the NZF as the pivotal centre party. Its election slogan was ‘Care. Think. Vote.’ However, the fledgling party failed to break through.</p>
            
            <p>It was the main governing party, National, that remained the most popular throughout the campaign. National had governed since 2008, and was hoping and expecting to be re‐elected for a fourth term in office. Key had been Prime Minister between 2008 and 2016, after which English had taken over.</p>
            
            <p>English campaigned strongly, defending the government's record, especially on the economy. National attempted to make the election revolve around its economic achievements, with the suggestion that a Labour‐led government would put all this at risk. Later in the campaign, National's finance spokesperson and campaign strategist, Steven Joyce, alleged that Labour's own economic policies contained a NZ$11.7 billion ‘fiscal hole’. Although this had the effect of focusing voters’ minds on scrutinizing Labour's economic policies, the claim largely backfired when the consensus amongst economists was that Joyce was largely wrong about the claim.</p>
            
            <p>Labour did, however, put significant effort into countering such scrutiny by taking a conservative approach to economic promises. For instance, the party campaigned on establishing a ‘tax working group’ to look at large‐scale reform of the tax system, but promised that there would be ‘no new taxes or levies’ until after the 2020 election.</p>
            
            <p>The election results were mostly unsurprising, with National winning a clear plurality of the vote: 44.5 per cent, but dropping about 2.5 percentage points, and losing four seats in the 120 MP parliament. National's three coalition partners also lost support. The Maori Party reduced its vote slightly, but more importantly lost its two seats. The United Future party, previously led by the retiring Dunne, did not win any seats. The Act New Zealand (A) party retained its one seat, but only received 0.5 per cent of the party vote – its lowest ever. What is more, the Conservative Party, also on the right of the political spectrum, which had previously won nearly 4 per cent of the vote, dropped to 0.2 per cent.</p>
            
            <p>The main party of opposition, Labour, had a significant boost, going from 25 per cent to nearly 37 per cent, and was the only party in Parliament to increase its vote. It gained 14 seats. Its ally, the Greens, went significantly backwards, winning only 6 per cent, down from 11 per cent at the previous election.</p>
            
            <p>This all meant that the left and right blocs in Parliament were short of the numbers to govern without the assistance of the pivotal centre party, the NZF. This party also lost ground, losing nearly 1.5 percentage points in the vote. But its 7.2 per cent of the vote, and nine MPs, meant that it was put into the position of choosing whether to allow National or Labour to government.</p>

         <p>Over the lifespan of the 2008–2017 National government, great attempts were made to rejuvenate the caucus and the cabinet. And in 2017, two senior cabinet ministers announced that they would retire at the 2017 general election: Minister of Foreign Affairs, Murray McCully, and Minister of Education, Hekia Parata. Their departures meant that a pre‐election cabinet reshuffle was necessary, so that the government would be able to campaign on the basis of its new team. On 24 April, English announced that Gerry Brownlee would take over as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Nikki Kaye would become Minister of Education. Both changes necessitated other portfolio changes.</p>

         <p>After the 23 September general election results were finalized, coalition talks then proceeded in parallel, with the NZF establishing whether a National‐ or a Labour‐led government would offer the better outcome. And on 26 October, leader Peters announced that his party had chosen Labour.</p>
         
         <p>A coalition agreement was then signed between the two parties, which meant that Ardern would be prime minister, Peters her deputy and the NZF would have four ministers in the cabinet. A lesser deal was signed between Labour and the Greens, which would also provide ministerial roles for three Green MPs, with the proviso that those ministers would be outside of the cabinet, which is a fluid convention previously used in coalition governments.</p>
         
         <p>This new coalition configuration was controversial because, until then, New Zealand governments normally involved the largest party in Parliament. In this case, the number of MPs from the second, third and fourth biggest parties were combined to create a majority, and outnumbered the largest party.</p>
         
         <p>The NZF MPs were given weighty ministerial roles. Of most importance, Peters became Minister of Foreign Affairs (a role he had held in a previous Labour‐led coalition, 2005–2008) and Shane Jones was made Minister for Regional Economic Development.</p>
         
         <p>The Greens were given three ministerial positions, but these positions would remain outside of the cabinet, mainly at the behest of the NZF party. This has led to some ambiguity as to whether the Greens are part of the coalition government or are simply a ‘support partner’. Technically, however, the Green ministers are part of the executive.</p>

         <p>The new 52nd Parliament continued the trend of bringing greater demographical diversity in politics. In terms of gender, a new record was achieved of 46 women elected, now making up 38 per cent of Parliament (Wilson <span><a href="#epdy12229-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12229-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Ethnically, Parliament also became more diverse. The number of MPs who self‐identified as being Maori reached a new high of 27, which was 22.5 per cent of MPs compared with a general population of 18 per cent being Maori. Similarly, the number of ‘Pacific Peoples’ represented in Parliament was about 7%, roughly in line with the general population. But Asian‐ethnicity MPs continued to be under‐represented in number, making 6 per cent of Parliament compared with about 12 per cent of society (Wilson <span><a href="#epdy12229-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12229-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>According to the research of Wilson (<span><a href="#epdy12229-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12229-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>), the median age of MPs after the election was 49 years. Although the ‘youngest MP is 23 years old; the oldest, 72 years’, these MPs are aberrations in a Parliament that overrepresents the 40–59‐year age group (Wilson <span><a href="#epdy12229-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12229-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). Well over half of MPs are ‘Generation X’ and 38 per cent are ‘baby boomers’.
         </p>
         
         <p>In addition, seven of the 120 MPs publically identified as being members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and intersex (LGBTQI) community. Also, a Green MP, Golriz Ghahraman, was the first former refugee to be elected to Parliament.</p>

         <p>The number of political parties represented in Parliament significantly reduced in 2017, with the demise of the Maori Party and United Future. This left only five parties, of which the Act New Zealand (A) only had one MP. This was the lowest number since proportional representation was introduced for the 1996 election. Also, the proportion of votes for minor parties reached a new low: only about 19 per cent.</p>

         <p>The Electoral Amendment Act 2017 and the Broadcasting (Election Programmes and Election Advertising) Amendment Act 2017 made a number of changes to the conduct of general elections, but these were mainly minor. The most important change was that political parties would no longer be allocated free airtime on Radio New Zealand and TVNZ to broadcast their opening and closing election campaign addresses. But parties were also now able to spend their state‐funded election broadcast advertising funding on digital campaigning.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12229-sec-0090-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Although New Zealand had largely escaped the global mood of dissatisfaction that had caused political turmoil in other electoral systems, there was a clear discontent over issues relating to the unaffordability of housing, and about poverty and inequality in general.</p>
         
         <p>Numerous surveys showed that materialist‐type issues were dominating public concern. Therefore, although many had forecast an election campaign based on immigration and the environment, it was more traditional economic issues that were determining voting intentions and underpinning the election‐time public debate.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the economic recession from 2008, the National government under Key had managed to assuage concerns about deprivation and inequality. However, the cost of living, and of housing in particular, became heavily politicized in 2017. Debates about child poverty were particularly apparent, leading to something of a bidding war between the two major parties over who would commit to get the most children out of poverty.</p>
         
         <p>Health also became a serious concern, along with other public services that were judged to be under‐funded. It was in this environment that the National government's re‐election slogan of ‘Delivering for New Zealand’ was less than convincing for many voters. Instead, the idea of ‘transformation’ promised by the new Labour leader, Jacinda Ardern, proved to be a game changer, leading to a new era of politics in this country.</p>
