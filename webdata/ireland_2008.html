         <p>The ongoing economic crisis, and what many saw as the inadequate government response to it, meant that the local and European elections that both took place on 5 June were going to be difficult for the government parties, which traditionally do badly in these elections. Because Fianna Fáil had been in government for twelve years, this was the third consecutive set of elections it was contesting as the main party in government. Hence it was from an unusually low base that Fianna Fáil went into these elections.</p>
         
         <p>The death of two TDs (MPs), one in the summer of 2008 and the other in early 2009, meant that by‐elections were also held. They were timed to take place with the European and local elections. In one of the constituencies, a well‐known television economics correspondent, who had criticised the government's economic policies for some years (usually from a centre‐left viewpoint), was approached and agreed to stand for the centre‐right Fine Gael. His spectacular success, taking over half the vote, even against the son of the deceased TD (a common strategy in Irish politics), highlighted the unpopularity of the government parties. In the other constituency, which was also the home base of the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Fianna Fáil chose Ahern's brother as its candidate. Here Fianna Fáil came fifth with just over 12 per cent of the vote, which was astonishing given that the party received almost 45 per cent in that constituency just two years earlier. A left‐wing, independent candidate was elected to replace the deceased left‐wing, independent TD.</p>
         
         <p>The results in the by‐elections reflected the national results in the local elections. Although local government is not powerful in Ireland, it is politically important because it is the basis on which parties build campaigns and ‘blood’ candidates for the general elections to the Dáil Éireann (lower house). Local issues are traditionally important for voters in national elections, so one would expect that local issues would be a priority for voters in local elections. In fact, we can see that these are second‐order elections where voters choose to punish government parties. Fianna Fáil lost 82 seats, bringing the party to 218 (of 883 nationally) and well behind the usually second place Fine Gael, which won 340 seats. That Fine Gael overtook Fianna Fáil is important psychologically as it is the first time that this has happened in any national election since the 1920s. The other government party, the Greens, lost 15 of its 18 seats, making the task of retaining its Dáil seats in the general election scheduled for 2012 even more difficult.</p>

</h2>
         
         <p>Despite the fact that Europe was a major issue for debate in Ireland in 2008 and 2009, the European election was dominated by domestic issues. These included the recession in the real economy, government attempts to generate economic growth by pumping billions of taxpayers' euros into banks, the parlous state of the government's finances and its attempts to manage the widening budget deficit by cutting spending, including cutting pay to public sector workers. These elections also tend to have an element of personality contest, but Fianna Fáil struggled to get credible candidates to agree to run as most knew that it would be difficult to get elected. The opposition parties, on the other hand, had less trouble attracting candidates.</p>
         
         <p>Again Fine Gael and Labour performed best. Fine Gael became the largest party in the state, with a marginal increase in its vote even though actually lost one seat (see <a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink">Table 2</a>). Labour gained representation in three of the four constituencies. Fianna Fáil retained three of its seats, but lost its seat in Dublin. In elections to the Dáil, Fianna Fáil is the only party to have had representation in all constituencies continuously since the 1930s. The fact that it lost its seat in Dublin, albeit because of a reduction in the number of seats, and was the third largest party in the capital understandably struck fear into the hearts of government TDs. This fear had an impact on national politics (see below).

         <p>Fianna Fáil's defeat by a Socialist candidate in Dublin should not be interpreted as a shift to the left in Irish politics. The candidate, Joe Higgins, was a popular and erudite parliamentarian whose defeat in the 2007 general election was lamented even by many on the right. Sinn Féin polled well, but failed to make a breakthrough at a time which one might have thought was set up perfectly for its populist, anti‐globalisation, anti‐capitalist message. That the party lost its one seat in the Republic (it topped the poll in Northern Ireland) added to the impression that this was a poor election for the party. The Green Party also performed poorly and perhaps more importantly its candidate in Dublin finished behind a former Green MEP who quit the party claiming that it had compromised its principles by entering a Fianna Fáil‐led government. On the right of the political spectrum, Libertas, whose leader Declan Ganley was widely credited with delivering the ‘no’ vote in the first Lisbon referendum, used his celebrity and substantial personal resources to attempt to build the first genuinely pan‐European party. However, he failed to get elected in the West constituency, and Libertas or Libertas‐aligned candidates performed poorly throughout the EU.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Lisbon Treaty referendum<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a>
</h2>
         
         <p>The Irish rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in 2008 failed to cause any inward reflection among the European elite. The Irish vote was decried as a selfish act by a small country that had gotten high on the idea that it was a rich country. Veiled threats from European leaders, repeated by politicians in Ireland, suggested that, if it did not ratify the Treaty, the country may find itself in the slow lane of a two‐speed Europe. As it became clear there would be no renegotiation of the type that the French and Dutch had secured when they rejected the Constitutional Treaty, it became obvious the Irish would have to vote again on the same text. The Irish have become used to reruns of referendums when the people deliver the ‘wrong’ result, having taken two goes to pass the Nice Treaty.</p>
         
         <p>Although the economic collapse appeared obvious at the time of the first referendum, the government campaign in 2008 focused more clearly on Ireland's dependence on European markets for many of the country's jobs. The government negotiated legal assurances from the EU that ensured, for instance, that Ireland would keep its right to nominate an EU Commissioner and that its tax sovereignty would be unaffected. Issues of a loss of sovereignty and power within Europe had been central to the Treaty's earlier defeat, but it is difficult to say that these issues had been dealt with in the intervening period.</p>
         
         <p>Whether these clarifications were necessary is moot. From early in the year, before these changes were secured, opinion poll evidence pointed to an overwhelming vote in support of the Treaty (by over two to one). What had changed was a realisation of the depth of the economic trouble Ireland was in. The ‘no’ side still campaigned on issues of sovereignty, including the right to control taxes, military neutrality, abortion policy and other diverse issues not obviously pertaining to the Treaty itself, but which opponents argued could be enforced on Ireland by the new institutional structures in the Treaty. The ‘yes’ side campaigned more vigorously. In particular, the business lobby campaigned separately for the Treaty – having usually preferred just to donate money to parties' campaigns. Ryanair, for instance, claimed to have spent close to €500,000 in support of a ‘yes’ vote. Other groups, such as farming organisations and unions, which had been equivocal in 2008, came out more clearly in support of the Treaty this time.</p>
         
         <p>So within 18 months Ireland reversed the decision quite dramatically. One could still see the same variation in support between various demographic groups, but all groups became much more pro‐Treaty. Women were still slightly less supportive than men; the young were much less in favour of the Treaty than the old; manual workers formed the group least supportive of the Treaty, but still a majority of this and all other demographic groups was in favour of the Treaty (Eurobarometer Flash 284, 2009). Most analysts argued that the economic crisis was the reason behind the rapid change, but there is as yet no systematic evidence for that assertion. In any case, two weeks later the President signed the Bill to give legal effect to the referendum vote, much to the relief of Taoiseach Brian Cowen.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Issues in national politics<a href="#en3" class="scrollableLink"><sup>3</sup></a>
</h2>
         
         <p>The unfolding economic crisis in Ireland was, unsurprisingly, the main focus of politics within the country. The year started with the nationalisation of Anglo‐Irish Bank. The bank was of no systemic importance – it had mainly lent to property developers and was heavily exposed to the Irish, British and American property markets. However, because the government had, under pressure from Anglo and other banks, covered it in the 2008 Bank Guarantee Scheme (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">O'Malley 2009</a></span>), its insolvency made it imperative that the government either take it under state control or be forced to pay off its debts more immediately. It also became apparent that executives from all banks had misled the government in the run up to the decision on the Bank Guarantee Scheme in 2008. Issues also emerged about the corporate governance of the banks as there appeared to be systematic attempts to mislead an already supine Financial Regulator. By the end of the year it was apparent that the decision to nationalise Anglo was to cost the state upwards of €20 billion.
         </p>
         
         <p>These scandals, and allegations that Fianna Fáil was trying to protect a ‘golden circle’ of investors in Anglo, many with links to the party, added to the pressure the government was under. When the pension levy came into force, lower‐paid civil servants held a one‐day strike. A number of prominent Green Party members resigned from the party complaining that it had abandoned its principles in government. Fianna Fáil lost a good deal of support in opinion polls, falling to as low as 22 per cent in some.</p>
         
         <p>The government attempted and succeeded in pushing through pay cuts for public sector workers at the end of the year, in addition to a pension levy on these workers imposed earlier in the year. The budget also increased taxes (in the form of levies) for all workers. In doing so, the Social Partnership process collapsed and unions threatened industrial action. Unions, however, failed to gain public support, and a division emerged between private and public sector workers. Many in the private sector lost their jobs and there was a sense that the public sector unions were trying to protect a privileged group as public sector workers had job security and valuable pensions.</p>
         
         <p>The government also introduced controversial legislation – again opposed by the union movement and opposition parties – to set up a National Assets Management Agency (Nama), which would buy the bad debts of the banks (at a rather ungenerous discount for the taxpayer), thus strengthening the banks' balance sheets and, it was hoped, give the banks money that would enable them to start lending to businesses and consumers and so help boost the real economy. It was proposed that the agency would take on €77 billion worth of debt. The government succeeded in getting its legislation passed even though many prominent economists questioned whether Nama would achieve its stated goals and there was a sense that it would do more to protect the banks than help the real economy.</p>
         
         <p>All this took a toll on the government. In 2008 one TD had resigned from the party and one independent withdrew his support. In 2009 the government lost more support as three TDs resigned the Fianna Fáil party whip (though they did not leave the party altogether and still tended to support the government); another resigned his seat as he had won a seat in the European Parliament. What in 2007 had been an oversized coalition now depended on the Green Party for its survival. The Green Party remained solidly behind the government and exacted a price for its loyalty in the form of a renegotiated programme for government. It also successfully blocked attempts to reintroduce fees for university students. In the course of this there was also controversy about the expenses for ministers and TDs. The <i>Ceann Comhairle</i> (speaker) was forced to resign in October when details emerged of extravagant expenses for official business that appeared only tangentially connected to his role.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Taoiseach Brian Cowen had set himself three goals for the year. One was to get the Nama legislation passed in the Dáil (no mean feat given the wobbly nature of government back‐benchers), push through cuts to the public sector wage bill and ratify the Lisbon Treaty. That he achieved these three goals probably gave him some satisfaction, and there was a feeling that the worst was behind him. His position was still vulnerable, however, as the public had little faith in his leadership. It was the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, who benefited from any public support for the actions of the government, to overcome the economic difficulties the country faced.</p>
         
         <p>It was also a bad year for the Catholic Church. A report on child abuse and the management of it that took place in Catholic Church‐run institutions in Dublin did not reveal much more than people who had followed the issue already knew, but it did catalogue its relentlessness and showed how the Church had systematically tried to cover these cases and protect the abusers from prosecution. The reaction of the religious Orders (who had claims against them indemnified by the state) to these revelations and their refusal to countenance revoking the government protection of their assets served to further undermine whatever moral authority the Church still had.</p>
