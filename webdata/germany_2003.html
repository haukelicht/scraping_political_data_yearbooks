         <p>As in the previous year, German politics was dominated throughout 2004 by the severe economic and budgetary crisis and the controversy about appropriate measures to address the country's worst economic problems for decades, particular the rising unemployment. Arguably, the governing Social Democrats went through their worst crisis since the beginning of the Federal Republic. In the wake of the widespread rejection of the neo‐liberal reforms that Chancellor Schröder had unilaterally launched in March 2003, the SPD went through a series of record low poll ratings and election returns and lost an incumbent Chancellor as party chairman, while the Greens could benefit electorally from the weakness of their coalition partner. The crisis reached a first climax on 6 February when Chancellor Schröder, in response to unprecedented low poll ratings, increasingly bitter criticism from the trade unions and highly critical media coverage, announced his resignation from the party chairmanship and declared that he wanted to concentrate on his executive office. This unilateral move seemed to have involved only his prospective successor, deputy party chairman Franz Müntefering while other senior party and government members were taken by surprise. The leadership reshuffle also cost SPD general secretary Olaf Scholz his post. He was succeeded by the low‐profile Berlin politician Klaus Uwe Benneter, an ex‐chair of the Young Socialists who had been expelled from the party for his extreme left‐wing positions in the mid‐1970s and now, in an ironic twist of fate, made a comeback as a national politician with a view to supporting the neo‐liberal policies of Chancellor Schröder who, incidentally, was more pragmatic in the 1970s and succeeded Benneter as leader of the Young Socialists.</p>
         
         <p>The change in leadership temporarily re‐invigorated the demoralized Social Democratic rank‐and‐file, but hopes that Müntefering would correct neo‐liberal policies were disappointed. Also, no electoral dividends were forthcoming: the SPD lost 6.3 per cent in the Hamburg <i>Land</i> elections in February, while the CDU benefited from the collapse of the right‐wing populist Schill Party (PRO) and won 21 per cent and an absolute majority in the former Social Democratic stronghold.
         </p>
         
         <p>CDU and CSU had their share of internal debates over the general direction of their policies. The controversy focused on tax and health policies. The latter was particularly controversial between the CSU and the CDU, who had decided to favour a flat rate health insurance in the previous year. The acrimonious debate continued throughout most of 2004 and resulted in an uneasy compromise between them in November. The agreed neo‐liberal turn was more modest than the original CDU concept, but nevertheless led to the resignation of CSU/CSU deputy parliamentary party leader Horst Seehofer (CSU) while his former colleague Friedrich Merz (CDU) had resigned from all senior party offices a few weeks earlier for the opposite reasons. His major concern was the introduction of a radical tax reform, which he saw endangered by the health compromise (see also <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Poguntke 2004</a></span>). As a result, opinion polls reported largely negative public evaluations of the Union parties’ performance while they could mainly benefit from the SPD's troubles in local, <i>Land</i> and European elections throughout the year.
         </p>
         
         <p>In March, following a lively public debate about possible candidates for the office of President of the Republic, CDU Party leader Angela Merkel asserted her power by single‐handedly nominating the largely unknown former Director of the International Monetary Fund, Horst Köhler. He was elected by a narrow majority by the Federal Assembly in May.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the year, economic difficulties continued to dominate the public debate. It became apparent in April that Germany would again violate the Maastricht deficit criteria. During the following months, public resistance to the labour market reforms (‘Hartz IV’) led to a revival of the ‘Monday demonstrations’, mainly in East Germany, although opinion polls showed that the majority of the population accepted the need for these reforms. In spring, first moves towards the foundation of a new left‐wing party were undertaken, and in July the ‘Alternative List for Jobs and Social Justice’ (<i>Wahlalternative Arbeit und Soziale Gerechtigkeit</i>) was launched. Its major focus was opposition to the neo‐liberal turn of the SPD and it could count on tacit (and sometimes not so tacit) support from within the trade union movement, which is traditionally allied to the Social Democrats. CDU and CSU made no secret of their preference for more decidedly neo‐liberal policies. When the demonstrations reached a peak in August, however, some Christian Democrats were less firm and called for corrections of legislation that had been passed by the <i>Bundesrat</i> with Christian Democratic consent at the end of the previous year. The need for a <i>de facto</i> Grand Coalition again became apparent in June when government and opposition agreed on the details of Hartz IV after months of negotiations in the arbitration committee (<i>Vermittlungsausschuß</i>) between <i>Bundestag</i> and <i>Bundesrat</i>.
         </p>
         
         <p>The European election of 13 June attracted little attention in Germany and was clearly fought as a second‐order national election. Turnout plunged to a record low (of 43 per cent) as did the SPD, which scored its worst ever result in a nationwide election (21.5 per cent) while the PDS finished very strong in the East. The Thuringia <i>Land</i> elections, which were held on the same day, offered little consolation: the SPD fell behind a previous weak result and reached a mere 14.5 per cent, while the Christian Democrats defended their overall majority. In September, the SPD continued to lose substantially in the <i>Land</i> elections of Saarland, Brandenburg and Saxony. Significantly, however, the Christian Democrats suffered a decline for the first time in 2004 in Brandenburg and Saxony where extreme right parties won seats in the <i>Land</i> legislatures: the extreme right‐wing party DVU was returned to the Brandenburg parliament and the NPD won seats in Saxony. Shortly after, both parties announced their intention to cooperate for the next <i>Bundestag</i> elections. By the end of the year, the SPD seemed to regain some of its ground, while CDU/CSU was experiencing declining poll ratings, not least as a result of internal strife and because it had become apparent that their socio‐economic policies would mean even more severe welfare cuts and labour market liberalisation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Other significant issues in 2004 included the compromise over immigration policy in the summer (again after extended negotiations between government and opposition). The emphasis of the legislation had shifted over the years and now stressed security aspects, which represents a departure from the initial intention of the red‐green coalition to regulate immigration. Towards the end of the year, the debate over the possible European Union membership of Turkey gained momentum and it became clear that Chancellor Schröder was in favour of beginning negotiations with Turkey, while CDU leader Angela Merkel rejected full membership. In December, attempts to reform the division of powers between the federation and the <i>Länder</i> failed. The aim of the ‘Federalism Commission’, which consisted of high‐ranking federal and <i>Land</i> politicians, had been to arrive at a clearer separation of powers and alleviate problems of the so‐called ‘joint decision trap’ that has plagued German cooperative federalism for many years.

         <p>Previous <i>Political Data Yearbook</i> entries have erroneously reported Thuringia as a CDU/SPD government, while the CDU has governed alone since 1 October 1999. From then onwards, four votes need to be added to the ‘opposition’ camp, while the ‘mixed’ camp has four votes less.
