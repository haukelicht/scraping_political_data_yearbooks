         <p>The year 2010 was the first since 2006 without any elections, change of government or other major political events in Lithuania. Hence, political life was relatively calm as the cabinet and parliamentary majority tried to find a way out of the very deep economic and financial crisis. A more than year long honeymoon between President Dalia Grybauskaitė and Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius continued. The opposition was publicly critical of the ruling centre‐right coalition, but even this criticism was not aimed at replacing the ruling parties in parliament or government.</p>
         
         <p>However, the economic and financial crisis continued, resulting in huge unemployment and extremely high rates of emigration. Nonetheless, economic conditions in 2010 were better than in 2009. GDP increased by 1.3 per cent after a decline of 14.7 per cent the previous year. The economy was showing clear signs of recovery in the second half of 2010 and during the last quarter, GDP increased by 4.8 per cent. Economic stabilisation was achieved primarily by a recovery in exports of goods and services mainly to the European Union (EU), which increased by as much as 16.3 per cent, although domestic demand has remained weak. A positive sign in a highly volatile economic environment was inflation decreasing to just 1.5 per cent in 2010.</p>
         
         <p>The financial crisis has severely hit the financial sector, and credit to the private sector has fallen by almost 12 per cent from a peak in November 2008 to July 2010. A considerable negative impact of the economic crises was on public finances. Public debt reached 38.2 per cent of GDP by the end of 2010, up from 29.5 per cent at the end of 2009. However, the Government declined financial assistance from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and decided to meet its financial needs predominantly in the European bond markets, paying much higher interest rates than to the IMF.</p>
         
         <p>The government deficit slightly decreased from 9.5 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 7.1 per cent in 2010, but was still high. An index of real earnings decreased by 2.9 per cent, but this was significantly less than the decline of 7.3 per cent in 2009. By March 2010, gross wages in the public sector had fallen by over 13 per cent, including salary cuts of 20 to 30 per cent for senior governmental officials as well as cuts to state pensions. Lithuania was rare amongst EU states in reducing pensions in response to the crisis. This harsh policy helps explain why the parliament and government had record low popularity ratings throughout 2010.</p>
         
         <p>The unemployment rate continued to climb and by the end of the year hit 17.8 per cent (against an EU average of 9.6 per cent), 4.1 per cent higher than in 2009. Among 15–24 year‐olds, unemployment reached 35.1 per cent, up 5.3 per cent on the previous year.</p>
         
         <p>Emigration peaked in 2010 as almost 84,000 citizens officially emigrated, almost four times more than in 2009.</p>
         
         <p>Some good news for economic recovery came through foreign direct investment (FDI) flows as a total of 31 new investment projects, including IBM, Western Union, Ryanair and Barclays Bank were launched in 2010, up 16 per cent compared to 2009. After a long hiatus, Lithuania again appears attractive for FDI projects due to the availability of highly skilled, well‐educated and multilingual professionals, a stable political climate and developed infrastructure as well as the Government's efforts in attracting FDIs.</p>
         
         <p>At the end of 2010 most agreed that the hardest times were ending and a modest economic recovery was ahead. However, tight fiscal policy, high unemployment and the weak supply of credit depressed domestic demand and posed obvious risks for recovery.</p>

         <p>The four‐party centre‐right coalition led by the Homeland Union/Lithuanian Christian Democrats (HU‐LCD) survived another year in power with just one seat more than required to maintain a minimal winning coalition.</p>
         
         <p>A marathon of no‐confidence votes in various ministers initiated by the centre‐left opposition parties, which started in 2009, continued without success in 2010. But these procedures were irritating for the ruling coalition. On 22 April, Valentinas Mazuronis, leader of the Order and Justice faction in the Seimas, initiated an interpellation to Eligijus Masiulis, Minister of Communications, which was supported by 44 MPs from various opposition parties, including the influential Social Democrats. The Minister was accused of mismanaging the postal services. However, on 13 May, 73 MPs voted in support of the Minister, with 49 voting against and 14 abstentions. Masiulis was the third minister to face a confidence vote. Gintaras Steponavičius, the Minister of Education, and Algirdas Šemeta, the former Minister of Finance, also retained their posts (<span><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Krupavicius 2010</a></span>: 1065–1066). On 6 December, 70 MPs'<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> (all the members of the opposition) signed a motion of no‐confidence in Arvydas Sekmokas, Energy Minister and a close personal ally of Kubilius. Sekmokas was blamed for failing to find an investor for a new nuclear plant after the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant in 2009, to diversify energy sources and enhance energy security and to negotiate better conditions of gas supplies from Russia. In March 2011, Sekmokas survived the no‐confidence vote.
         </p>
         
         <p>However, the opposition parties began intensively discussing a vote of no‐confidence in the entire government on its two‐year anniversary. The Government has been highly unpopular (with an approval rating of just 11.6 per cent, even lower than in 2009). Three ministers out of 14 have been replaced during 2010. However, the Kubilius cabinet remained relatively stable and the vote of no‐confidence did not materialize.</p>
         
         <p>Kubilius remained optimistic, declaring the end of the recession and a turning point in the economic crisis as the country's economy began slowly to improve. Moreover, a major strength of the Kubilius Government was that President Grybauskaitė consistently supported the Prime Minister personally by declaring frequently in public that she did not see an alternative to the Kubilius cabinet and the centre‐right coalition in parliament. Major achievements of the Government included an electricity exchange market based on the Scandinavian model, higher education reform and increased transparency within public administration. The business environment also improved and became more transparent due to efforts to tackle corruption.</p>
         
         <p>In 2010, three ministers resigned following ongoing tensions within the cabinet. The replacement of Vygaudas Ušackas, Minister of Foreign Affairs, was inspired by Kubilius's ally, President Grybauskaitė. The motives for Ušackas resignation remained unclear as the President only declared her lack of confidence him. According to Lithuania's Constitution, the President's powers are real and significant rather than symbolic, especially within foreign policy where he or she determines policy alongside the government. Thus, the Minister of Foreign Affairs must collaborate very closely with the President. Tensions between Grybauskaitė and Ušackas first appeared in public in mid‐2009, when the President asked for an investigation into the alleged Central Intelligence Agency detention facility in Lithuania (<span><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Krupavicius 2010</a></span>: 1072–1073) and the Minister publicly expressed scepticism about the existence of such a facility. From late September 2009 to January 2010 the President and the Minister – the two key actors in foreign policy – ceased communicating in person which was a most irregular situation. Rumours abound that Grybauskaitė saw Ušackas as a potential rival for the 2014 presidential elections, and therefore sought to remove him from office as soon as possible. The President's office deliberately sought Ušackas' resignation in public, claiming that foreign policy is central to Lithuania's interests and cannot be manipulated by a minister for political self‐promotion. Kubilius had personally invited Ušackas, formerly Ambassador to the United Kingdom, to take the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, so it was expected that he would try to save Ušackas, but instead he prioritised securing Grybauskaitė's support for his Cabinet.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 29 January, Grybauskaitė appointed Audronius Ažubalis, former chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, as the new Minister of Foreign Affairs. A former press officer of Vytautas Landsbergis, at that time chairperson of the Supreme Council Re‐Constituent Seimas and three‐term MP, Ažubalis was considered a ‘party soldier’ without ambition to become ‘a general’. This was the first time in more than a decade that a non‐career diplomat became Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
         
         <p>Shortly after Ušackas's exit, Algis Čaplikas, the Minister of Health from the Liberal and Centre Union (LCU), resigned due to a corruption scandal when the Deputy Health Minister Artūras Skikas was convicted for soliciting a bribe of 20,000 Litas. Raimondas Šukys, Deputy Speaker of the Seimas, was assigned by the LCU to the post of Health Minister in late February.</p>
         
         <p>An ongoing trouble‐maker for the Kubilius Government (<span><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Krupavicius 2010</a></span>: 1066) was the Nation's Resurrection Party (NRP), an insider of the ruling right‐wing coalition. This time Arūnas Valinskas, leader of its parliamentary faction, declared dissatisfaction with Remigijus Vilkaitis, Minister of Culture, who was assigned to this position by the same party. He was blamed primarily for an alleged absence of cooperation with the parliamentary faction and the party. After long internal (and sometimes public discussions) that had gone on since early spring, Vilkaitis was pushed out by his party in June.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nominating a new Minister of Culture was a slow and complicated process as Valinskas had personal ambitions for the post, but the President opposed him and the Prime Minister supported her input. In late April, Grybauskaitė extinguished Valinskas' hopes by publicly stating that he had neither the abilities for the job nor public approval. Valinskas responded that Grybauskaitė was an ‘insulted old hag’ whose opinion should not be taken verbatim and if politics were based on popularity, the Prime Minister should be sacked because of his low poll ratings. Eventually, Arūnas Gelūnas, a non‐party professional artist and scholar, received the support of the President and the NRP.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the year people remained highly critical of the activities of the Government, and especially of the austerity measures. Kubilius topped a list of most unpopular politicians and the Government's popularity ratings were down even compared to 2009, falling to 13.7 per cent in December. Trust in the Government was also the lowest since the Russian financial crisis in 1998–1999, falling down to 9.3 per cent, with trust in the Seimas at 3.2 per cent and in political parties at just 2.4 per cent. Kubilius' score was 8.1 per cent and he was supported only by the traditional electorate of the HU‐LCD. Thus, the survival of the Kubilius cabinet was a notable event of 2010.</p>

      <div class="article-section__content" id="ss3">
         
         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Changes in the parliament</h2>
         
         <p>The Seimas agenda in 2010 was tightly focused on fighting corruption, developing an independent energy sector including alternative energy supply options, managing state‐owned enterprises and approving the annual state budget, but the early promised reforms of the Social Insurance Fund or healthcare sector were neglected.</p>
         
         <p>From January, the ruling coalition struggled to maintain a majority in the Seimas after the founding of the Christian Party, joined by the parliamentary faction ‘One Lithuania’. Moreover, coalition partners of the HU‐LCD showed instability. In April, the Seimas voted on a constitutional amendment allowing direct mayoral elections and the LCU (a junior coalition partner with seven MPs) claimed that this vote would determine their willingness to remain in the coalition. This proved to be an empty threat when they stayed even though the amendment was rejected.</p>
         
         <p>The HU‐LCD, the leading coalition party, also showed signs of internal disagreements. A radical right wing of the party, mainly comprising members of the former Nationalists' Union (who joined the HU‐LCD in 2008), rebelled against Kubilius and sought to remove him from the leadership because he had voted for allowing the writing of family names in languages other than Lithuanian. Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the HU‐LCD actively sought options for broadening the ruling coalition.</p>
         
         <p>The initial target was the newly founded Christian Party, which had inherited 12 MPs from the faction ‘One Lithuania’, a splinter group from the NRP. However, the new party leader was Gediminas Vagnorius, a controversial former Prime Minister and a rival of Kubilius within the former HU‐LCD. This was a major obstacle to the Christian Party joining the coalition. On 15 March, the Christian Party announced its decision to join the opposition with the possibility of forming a new ruling majority. In addition, Vidmantas Žiemelis, who was elected on the HU‐LCD list in 2008 and had worked with Vagnorius in the cabinet while Minister of the Interior in 1996–98, joined the parliamentary Christian Party faction, increasing its membership to 13. Politically, Žiemelis long ago ceased to be a member of the ruling coalition because of his independent voting in parliament.</p>
         
         <p>The fragile balance between minority and majority rule was evident in March during a vote to appoint a new first Deputy Speaker of the Seimas to replace Raimondas Šukys, who became the Minister of Health. In a secret ballot, a minority of 59 MPs supported Jonas Liesys, the ruling coalition's candidate from the LCU. After these events, three minor partners of the HU‐LCD (the LCU, Liberal Movement and the NRP) reaffirmed that they were all staying in the coalition and were not considering joining any other bloc.</p>
         
         <p>In spring of 2010 speculations regarding a broader coalition were rife, with many major opposition parties named as potential partners, with the exception of the Social Democrats. In the end nothing happened, and Grybauskaitė criticised the left‐wing opposition.</p>
         
         <p>A procedure for impeachment of two MPs was another remarkable event of 2010 in the Seimas. This scandal involved Aleksandras Sacharukas, a former member of the NRP who played a key role in the removal of Arūnas Valinskas from the Seimas Speaker's post in 2009 (<span><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Krupavicius 2010</a></span>: 1067). Linas Karalius, a member of the Christian Faction, was accused of unauthorised travel in Southeast Asia during the parliamentary session in January, using his diplomatic passport and lying about the purpose of his travels, while Sacharukas used Karalius's MP's card to vote in more than ten Seimas sittings while he was gone. After an investigation by a special commission in May, the Seimas initiated the impeachment process and addressed the Constitutional Court, accusing the two Christian faction members of violating the Constitution and breaking their oath as members of the Seimas. At the end of October the Constitutional Court found Sacharukas and Karalius guilty of gross violation of Article 59 of the Constitution for lying to the Seimas and committing fraud. On 11 November the Seimas voted to impeach Linas Karalius (89 voted for, 16 against, 13 abstentions), but not Aleksandras Sacharukas (80 for, 24 against and 13 abstentions, with 85 votes out of 141 required to enact an impeachment).
         </p>
         
         <p>The opposition then called for early elections and collected 50 MPs' signatures. Their attempt failed after the draft proposal was rejected by parliament, falling 34 votes short of the number required. Although the ruling coalition survived the threat of early elections, some structural changes took place in the Seimas. First, a faction of the NRP disappeared from parliament. On 20 September, the United Faction of the LCU and NRP was founded in the Seimas led by Algis Čaplikas. In April, the parliamentary faction ‘One Lithuania’ was reorganised into the Christian Party faction led by Vidmantas Žiemelis, which initially had 12 members.</p>
         
         <p>Two new political parties also arose. The centre‐left Lithuanian People Union, led by ex‐premier Kazimira Prunskienė, was actually started in 2009, but initially the Ministry of Justice refused to register it because the documents were not in order. On 23 January, two small parties – the Christian Conservative Social Union (which existed since 2004) and the Lithuanian Party of Christian Democracy (founded in 2001, but almost unknown) – decided to merge and establish the Christian Party as a centre‐right political organisation. Gediminas Vagnorius, a former Prime Minister in 1991–1992 and 1996–1999, was elected party leader. Vagnorius was a controversial politician who was excluded from the Homeland Union in 2000, but his new party never made it into the Seimas. The Christian Party, even before official registration, was a parliamentary party with 12 MPs as it inherited a splinter faction from the NRP.</p>
         
         <p>For many, the most important event of 2010 was the death of former President Algirdas Brazauskas on 26 June. He was one of the most popular and influential politicians of Lithuania since he first addressed the Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1988, intending to speed up significantly Gorbachev's <i>perestroika</i>. He became the First (and the last) Secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party. In 1990, Brazauskas was elected to the Supreme Council Re‐Constituent Seimas and actively participated in a restoration of Lithuania's statehood. He served in the highest ranking national offices from 1990 to 2006, including Deputy Prime Minister, Speaker, President (1993–1998) and Prime Minister (2001–2006), as well as leading the Social Democratic Party (2001–2007). He oversaw a period of economic stability, established friendly relations with Lithuania's neighbours, created strategic partnerships with Poland and helped Lithuania join NATO and the EU. His passing marked the end of an era.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>In January, the National Defence Council approved strengthening intelligence oversight and coordination, including the restructuring of the national intelligence system and the State Security Department. Henceforth, the main institution coordinating the intelligence services will be the National Defence Council, led by the President.</p>
         
         <p>In March, RimantėŠalaševičiūtė, head of the Ombudsman for Children Rights, was fired. This reflected a reaction of MPs to the Kedys incident (<span><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Krupavicius 2010</a></span>: 1073–1074) rather than an evaluation of the Ombudsman. Her successor was Edita Žiobienė, a professional lawyer and lecturer at Mykolas Romeris University.
         </p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="article-section__content" id="ss5">
         
         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The main issue was the need to tackle the deep financial crisis. It became clear that 2010 was a difficult year but the worst crisis is almost over and Lithuania is very slowly recovering. The buzz issues (which remain unresolved) were fighting the shadow economy, smuggling and corruption. Unemployment, pensions and emigration dominated the agenda (see above). A Eurobarometer survey showed that nearly one‐quarter of Lithuanians are planning to leave the country permanently within the next decade – the highest figure in the EU behind Latvia (<span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">New Europeans 2010</a></span>: 167). The United Kingdom and Germany were the destinations of choice. In 2010, some 47 per cent of Lithuanians already had family members living and working in another country (<span><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">New Europeans 2010</a></span>: 26).
         </p>
         
         <p>Energy policy is a permanent issue of Lithuanian politics and 2010 was the first year without the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Fears of extreme electricity shortages and price increases did not materialise. Energy prices did go up, but moderately, and Lithuania was successful in purchasing the required power from abroad.</p>
         
         <p>Changes to the Lithuanian energy system also took place. The wholesale electricity trade was reorganised. An electricity grid project was introduced between Lithuania and Sweden with the aim of promoting trading between Baltic and Nordic electricity markets, and increasing the security of power supply in both markets. The Western and Eastern Power Network Grids were unified into LESTO, a national distribution network operator. The overall aim was to increase efficiency and autonomy as the country imported almost 50 per cent of its electricity, and Russian gas monopoly Gazprom supplied all of its gas. However, a major setback was the failed tender for a strategic investor in a new nuclear power station after the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) withdrew its bid. Yet the Government was quite optimistic that it would find an investor to build a plant by 2020 through direct negotiations.</p>
         
         <p>New foreign policy directions promised by Grybauskaitė in 2009 remained unclear, controversial and widely discussed in the country. In April the first strange decision was made by Grybauskaitė, who refused to accept Barack Obama's invitation to celebrate the START Treaty in Prague with leaders of ten Eastern European countries. This refusal was named by Lithuanian media as one of the biggest blunders of the year.</p>
         
         <p>Moreover, during a televised interview in early September Grybauskaitė claimed that Lithuania used to be a hostage to American policy (i.e., during the Adamkus presidency) and had recently freed itself from this status. She did state that the United States remains Lithuania's most important partner in the security framework and NATO partnership, but said that she would not allow any country to dictate what Lithuania should do. After this interview other senior officials, including Kubilius, spent several weeks explaining that the United States has been and will remain among Lithuania's most important strategic partners. Poor articulation seems to be a problem for Grybauskaitė as it was not the first incident of misinterpretation of her public speeches.</p>
         
         <p>Following the publication of WikiLeaks cables, the Eagle Guardian, a NATO contingency plan drawn up in early 2010 to defend Poland against an attack by Russia, was extended to the Baltic States and will have serious implications for the security of the Baltic region in future (Traynor 2010).</p>
         
         <p>Attempts by the President's office to improve bilateral Lithuanian–Belarusian relations did not produce clear positive results. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko broke his personal promises to Grybauskaitė to have more democratic presidential elections in December 2010; the day after voting, he arrested most of the former presidential candidates and some of them were jailed.</p>
         
         <p>Lithuanian–Polish relations, which for a long time were called a strategic partnership, experienced serious tensions because of an inability to solve issues related to the spelling of Polish names in the original language, rumours of the possible sale of the Orlen Lietuva oil refinery plant to Russia, Polish pressure on the Lithuanian Government to sell Klaipėdos Nafta (one of the most modern oil terminals in Europe after a reconstruction in 2002) to PKN Orlen, accusations of discriminating against Polish investors through high (and unjustified) tariffs applied by a state‐owned Lietuvos Geležinkeliai (Lithuanian Railway) to Orlen Lietuva and so on. Unfortunately, neither the President nor other current leaders of the country invested enough effort in finding greater consensus with Poland and reversing the worsening relations with the neighbouring country.</p>
         
         <p>Since early spring there was broad public debate about a forthcoming Baltic Pride march in Vilnius on 8 May, making it the first public event in support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trangendered (LGBT) people ever to take place in Lithuania. A public opinion poll beforehand stated that three‐quarters of the population opposed the Baltic Pride march. Moreover, Lithuania's interim Attorney General asked the court to ban the march on the grounds that expected counter‐demonstrations might pose a risk to public order. This was despite the police and the Mayor of Vilnius having pledged to guarantee the safety of participants at the event. Even Amnesty International called for the Baltic Pride march to be held in safety and in full respect of freedom of expression and assembly.</p>
         
         <p>However, on 1 March a controversial law came into effect on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information, which censors certain information as unacceptable for the country's youth. This law removed the word ‘homosexuality’ and banned the spreading of information about same sex marriages. According to Eurostat, Lithuania is one of the European countries most intolerant of otherness, including homosexuality, and it has the lowest numbers of homosexuals who have come out and told their friends and relatives about their sexuality. In the end, the Baltic Pride parade in Vilnius took place without major incidents.</p>
         
         <p>In early 2010 there was a failed bid by New Union (Social Liberals) to organise a referendum forcing pre‐term elections to the Seimas, but they fell 50,000 signatures short of the required 300,000.</p>
         
         <p>Last but not the least, Lithuania for the first time scored five points out of ten in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and came 46<sup>th</sup> out of 178 countries.
