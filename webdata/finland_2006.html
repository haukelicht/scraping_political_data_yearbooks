         <p>The Finnish parliament elected Matti Vanhanen Prime Minister on Tuesday, 17 April 2007. The Centre Party leader received 121 votes, which is more than the simple majority required to be elected. On Thursday 19 April, the President of the Republic appointed Finland's 70th Cabinet. He also released the ministers from Vanhanen's first cabinet from their duties.</p>
         
         <p>The March election 2007 was disastrous for the socialist bloc, which only managed to win 30 per cent of the seats in parliament. As a result, the Finnish parliament is one of the most non‐socialist legislatures in Europe. The conservative National Coalition (KOK) managed to win ten seats and outdistanced the former cabinet party Social Democrats (SDP) by five seats. In fact, all former cabinet coalition partners – the agrarian Centre Party (KESK), the SDP and the Swedish Peoples Party (SFP) – lost votes and/or seats. Only the SFP won back a seat, although the party lost votes in the election. During the campaign, the National Coalition was able to rally its own supporters, and Sauli Niinistö, the former Finance Minister and presidential candidate, won more personal votes than any other candidate. In addition, the party leader Katainen promised in a televised debate to ensure that nurses will get considerably better salaries. The female‐dominated profession has for years been underpaid. The Social Democrats, on the other hand, conducted a bad campaign assisted by the labour union, exemplified by a poster and video clip showing a stereotypical capitalist stuffing himself with food and drink – an effort that earned a great deal of negative attention in media.</p>
         
         <p>According to the new Constitution, it is no longer the President who takes the initiative to form a cabinet after the election. Instead it is the Speaker of Parliament who has taken over the role. He passes on the task to the biggest party in parliament, which was the former Prime Minister's Centre Party, which beat KOK by only one seat in the election – albeit enough to put the former Prime Minster Matti Vanhanen in charge of cabinet formation. From the very beginning it was made clear that the election results should be reflected in the composition of the cabinet. This was a signal to the SDP that the large non‐socialist majority would take over the leadership in the country. Together, the Centre Party and the KOK could rule the republic as they held a slight majority of seats in parliament. Since the late 1970s, Finland has been ruled by majority coalition cabinets; indeed, minority cabinets are not an option that is ever seriously discussed. However, to be sure of a majority support in parliament, one or two small parties must be included. The Swedish SFP has been a standing coalition partner since the late 1970s, and the party made it clear very early on that it was ready to continue. The price of including the Christian Democrats was higher, whereas the Green League did not make a probable sixth nuclear power plant plan a sticking point in the negotiations. The four non‐socialist parties – the Centre Party, the KOK, the SFP and the Greens – formed the platform for a cabinet supported by 125 seats out of 200 in parliament. The next step was to agree on a programme for the cabinet and on how to share out ministerial portfolios. Around 70 pages were laid down in a document that covered many issues in foreign, European Union (EU) and domestic politics, and would serve as a programme for the next four years – progress on which was to be evaluated annually by the cabinet.</p>

         <p>In foreign policy, the government committed itself to enhancing Finnish readiness to participate in international crisis management by intensifying cooperation in the use of military and civil resources, and full participation in joint EU security and crisis management cooperation. The cabinet would also develop the peace partnership with NATO and explore the possibility of applying for full membership of that organisation. The development of cooperation between the EU and NATO is an important part of the European security and defence policy. The Finnish government supports a continuing enlargement of EU according to agreed criteria. Therefore, it supports the membership negotiations with Turkey and Croatia, and a stepwise integration of the Balkan states. In addition, Finland wants to revise the EU Constitution, which has been agreed in negotiations, but not yet accepted and implemented. Government action is needed to improve environmental protection in and around the Baltic Sea area. More resources might be focused on the Nordic Dimension in conjunction with boosting economic cooperation in the region.</p>
         
         <p>In order to improve productivity and the economy, taxes will be cut for employees and on livestock. A change in company taxation would also take place according to international audit standards, including ships sailing under the Finnish flag. Also the import of foreign labour must be increased as the Finnish population is aging. Taxation would increase on tobacco and alcohol for health reasons and on petrol to discourage pollution. Environmental protection would be beefed up and more emphasis put on developing energy production from renewal resources. As old coal and oil power plants are run down, their energy production cannot be compensated for fully by renewable energy. Therefore a sixth nuclear plant was not ruled out.</p>

         <p>After negotiations, the two dominant parties – the Centre Party and the KOK – agreed to eight portfolios each, giving the prime ministerial seat to Matti Vanhanen. This would make 16 portfolios out of a total of 18. However, neither the SFP nor the Greens were enthusiastic about having only one portfolio each. To solve the problem, two new ministerial portfolios were introduced including a new division of labour in several ministries. The election result in terms of gender was well reflected in the new cabinet. In total, 42 per cent of the 200 MPs are women, and 12 of the 20 cabinet seats are held by female ministers. A female majority in cabinet has never happened before in Finnish political history. Against this can be argued that all the heavy portfolios are designated to men as the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs both went to KOK male leaders. However, most of the annual state budget expenditure goes to health, education and social care – all of which are led by female ministers.</p>
         
         <p>The cabinet reflected the election results in terms of number and power. As the Centre Party got the Prime Minister's post, the KOK party leader Jyrki Katainen took over the Ministry of Finance including the role of deputising Prime Minister. The KOK veteran Ilkka Kanerva got the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instead of the former party leader Sauli Niinistö, who chose to be elected the new Speaker of the Parliament. SFP and the Greens were happy to get two portfolios each, but without the same significance as most of the other portfolios. The Green party leader Tarja Cronberg, who failed to be elected to parliament did not get the Environment Ministry, which could have been more natural for her and the party; instead she got the post of Minister of Labour. Similarly the SFP party leader Stefan Wallin was not made Minister of Education; instead he became the Minister of Culture and Sport with much less influence on language policy in the educational system.</p>
         
         <p>In summary, given its strong majority in parliament, the new government should be able to implement its programme efficiently. According to that programme it seems also evident that Finland is going to be more NATO friendly, and, in domestic politics, more right‐wing than it was when the SDP was in the coalition. In foreign policy there is a risk that the Social Democratic President and the Minister of Foreign Affairs might not see eye to eye, which may fuel future debate over the role of the President in the Constitution.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in politics</h2>
         
         <p>Finland is a unitary state, which means that the government can intervene in municipal autonomy. The Centre Party has traditionally been the party with strongest support in the 416 municipal councils. As a result, the party has not been keen to support municipality amalgamations. However, during Vanhanen's first cabinet a change occurred in the party leadership that led it to follow the Social Democrats and National Coalition in their uncritical view that economic efficacy and large units are closely connected and have to be implemented. A law enacted by Vanhanen's first cabinet came into force in February 2007 to reorganise health care into larger units, crossing municipality borders if needed, and to make municipalities bigger (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Lag 169/2007</a></span>). In Finland, the reforms have caused a lot of debate involving people at grassroots level. Municipalities that do not follow the law can be sanctioned, whereas those who follow it are rewarded. The reforms are solely enacted in terms of economic efficacy, with local democracy hardly mentioned.
         </p>
         
         <p>Vanahanen's second cabinet voted in June to support the claim from Helsinki city to capture a part of its neighbouring municipalities. The small Sibbo municipality resisted, supported by a referendum showing 93 per cent against annexation, but this had no effect on three cabinet parties (the Centre Party, National Coalition and the Greens). The Swedish People's Party stood alone against it and was overruled. Sibbo has a huge Swedish population and an annexation will make them a small minority in the city of Helsinki. The annexation is seen by many as creating a precedent for cities to capture parts of, or the entire territory, of their small neighbours – an additional worry for ethnic Swedes because larger units, it seems, do not take sufficient account of their wishes. This is true as well for the reforms put forward by the cabinet to enlarge police districts into big Finnish‐speaking units; the same holds true for district courts. As knowledge of Swedish is often poor among Finnish police officers and judges, which increases the risk that Finns and ethnic Swedes will be unequally treated in the legal system.</p>
         
         <p>Soon after elections, the nursing union mobilised to claim €500 as promised in the KOK campaign. Party leader Katainen, now Finance Minister in the new cabinet, refused to support the nurses with public money. In addition, he denied any promises of wage increases and the conflict escalated. The union reacted and chose a more effective weapon than strike action. A massive campaign began to voluntarily take notice of dismissal. Thousands of nurses joined and measures were taken by the cabinet to criminalise the action from the outset. At the last minute, however, a compromise was found, giving the nurses a salary increase of between 22 and 28 per cent over four years. The nurses got strong popular support and huge media attention favouring their campaign.</p>
