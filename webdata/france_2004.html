         <p>On 28 February, deputies and senators (the so‐called ‘Congress’) met in order to reform the Constitution. Two topics were at stake. The first was to rewrite a large part of the Constitution (Title XV) in order to harmonize the old text with the prospect of the new European Charter that would be submitted to a referendum. Generally speaking, new articles 88‐1 to 88‐7 allow the government to transfer responsibilities to the European Union (EU). However, new article 88‐7 specifies that any future enlargement of the EU must be submitted to a national referendum. Some 730 of the lawmakers were in favour of the reform, 66 were opposed and 96 did not choose or did not participate in the vote. As the EU's Constitutional Treaty was rejected by the French people (see below), the old title XV is still the rule with the notable exception of the necessity to organize a referendum when new countries might be eligible to join the EU. At the same time, lawmakers endorsed a second amendment adding a charter of environmental protection to the Constitutional preamble that settles the general principles of the French Republic (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, Human Rights, and so on).</p>

         <p>A very large part of the political debate in 2005 was organized around the European issue. As President Chirac decided in July 2004 to submit the Constitutional Treaty to a referendum, the question of the ‘nature’ of the EU, which had been (even when European elections took place) very marginal, became a real issue. However, at the level of political parties and elites, the choice between ‘yes’ and ‘no’ disrupted the normal lines (i.e., left versus right) of French political life. The most striking event was the ‘split’ within the Socialist Party. The ‘leftist’ factions within the party emphasized that the economic part of the Constitution was excessively oriented toward liberalism. They received unexpected support when L. Fabius, well known as a long‐time pro‐European and in his political positions as an architect of European integration, announced that he would support a ‘no’ vote. The opponents to the Treaty asked their party to organize an ‘internal referendum’. They were defeated as 58 per cent of Socialist adherents chose a ‘yes’ vote (1 December 2004). However, the Socialist ‘no’ faction decided not to follow the tradition of ‘party discipline’ and campaigned for a ‘no’ against the party majority.</p>
         
         <p>One can distinguish three camps: for a ‘yes’, the UDF, the majority of the UMP and the majority of the PS, arguing that the charter would make the EU more democratic; for ‘no’, the ‘s<i>ouverainists</i>’ who did not support the EU (National Front, de Villiers's supporters and a part of the UMP) and pointed out that the Treaty would sap the sovereignty of the Member States; for ‘no’, a strange leftist coalition coming from the Trotskyist extreme left to the dissent Socialists via the Communist Party and the movements acting against economic globalization (‘<i>mondialisation</i>’, in French terms). The leftist ‘no’ camp supported the idea of a mythical ‘plan B’ that would replace the Constitutional Treaty and avoid having Europe move towards unfettered capitalism that put welfare systems at risk.
         </p>
         
         <p>The electoral campaign was very interesting and new in terms of channels of mobilization. The majority of the elites (politicians, managers, media) supported the ‘yes’ faction and they monopolized the traditional channels of communication. However, the leftist ‘no’ camp was able to use two other channels: first, the network of associations and personalities coming from ecology to anti‐<i>mondialist</i> movements via the opponents to the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in France, Europe and the world; and second, an intensive campaign on the Internet via websites and blogs.
         </p>
         
         <p>The citizens were interested in the campaign and participation in the ballot was high. However, it seems that the leftist ‘no’ coalition mobilized its potential support better than the other two camps. According to surveys, fewer and fewer citizens agreed with the Treaty. According to CSA surveys, which were the first to forecast a possible ‘no’ victory, in February 2005 more than 60 per cent of the electorate would choose to vote ‘yes’; on 16–17 March, only 49 per cent would vote in favour of the Constitutional Treaty. It is difficult to explain so abrupt a change in voters' minds and the results of the referendum. Many factors contributed to explain the ‘no’ outcome. The first was dissatisfaction with the Raffarin government: in April 2005, only 27 per cent of the people interviewed by SOFRES were confident in his ‘ability to handle the most important problems that France has to face’; the figure for J. Chirac was 36 per cent. The second was a hidden opposition to the enlargement of the EU and to the new countries that do not have the same standard of living and might be used in the new Europe in order to put the old welfare systems at risk (see the debate on the Blokenstein guideline). Third, one could point to a French culture focused on the role of the state in all domains (economic, social, cultural) and, in consequence, a general hesitancy toward any form of liberalism. In France, the state is a sort of <i>deus ex machina</i> that must protect its citizens and provide answers to all of their demands and fears. In terms of sociological support, the vote increased the gap between the privileged categories (managers; professionals; high public civil servants), who adopted the charter and the less privileged people (employees, blue collar workers, the unemployed), who rejected it.
         </p>
         
         <p>The main consequence of the ‘no’ victory was the resignation of J.P. Raffarin and the appointment of D. de Villepin as Prime Minister (31 May). Former Minister of Foreign Affairs (2002–2004), moving from the Minister of Interior to the Hotel Matignon, D. de Villepin is a longstanding Chirac loyalist and was once his top counsellor at the Elysée. However, the President of the Republic also had to appoint N. Sarkozy, a potential candidate in the 2007 presidential election, as Minister of State and Minister of the Interior. In fact, there was something like two prime ministers with the same ambition to become president and with largely conflicting views on many subjects.</p>
         
         <p>The composition of the new government reflected an attempt to show that President J. Chirac had heard the concerns of the citizenry. The cabinet, without junior ministers and with only 31 posts, was smaller than the previous cabinet. The new course was still packaged under the 2004 slogan ‘social cohesion’, which sounded like a remake of the ‘social gap’ (‘<i>fracture sociale</i>’) of Chirac's 1995 presidential electoral campaign. However, the new government was still a UMP cabinet, as only one minister was labelled ‘UDF’, and this minister participated in the government against his party's political and strategic positions. The Prime Minister was above all committed to fighting unemployment and during the summer and the autumn he implemented some policies (creation of jobs by the state; a decrease in the taxes paid by employers; new contracts of employment for the non‐qualified workers in small companies) that divided the UMP between the ‘liberals’ led by N. Sarkozy and Chirac's supporters who were more confident in the role of the state in economic life. They did not convince the UDF to support frankly the government; moreover, in November the majority of the UDF in the National Assembly did not vote for the Budget.
         </p>
         
         <p>The result of the referendum was a shock for President Chirac, who suffered a grave loss of credibility and an important decrease in his popularity: in June 2005, only 24 per cent of the French public were confident in his ability to rule France. D. de Villepin's government did not really benefit from a ‘honeymoon period’ as in July only 39 per cent of those interviewed thought that ‘it was able to manage the problems that France has to face’. It is true that the policies in the employment domain put it at a higher rate of popularity (44 per cent in October). However, riots in the poor suburbs, which occurred all over France in October and November, stopped this revival (39 per cent in November). Three weeks of rioting by disaffected youths put onto the table the issue of discrimination in housing, education and employment largely ignored by all politicians. The debate was not really on immigration, but on the status of minorities who are French, but as said by many concerned people, not ‘real’ as they have to live in ugly suburban clusters and are unable to get jobs even when they are highly educated. The burning of cars, schools, shops and public buildings revealed both a feeling of frustration and a lack of French identity that were turned against the state and its main institutions. President Chirac emphasized a ‘French malaise’ and pledged to lobby companies, the media and political parties to increase the visibility of France's urban ethnic minorities. Thereafter, a latent conflict sprung out within the government about the French model of integration. N. Sarkozy favoured positive discrimination (a sort of affirmative action); D. de Villepin answered that there was no place for positive discrimination in a state built on the notion of equal opportunities for everyone. Would France change its ‘republican model' – a universal model under which each individual is respected for who he or she is, independent of colour or religion? This point will perhaps be discussed in 2007 during the presidential campaign.</p>
