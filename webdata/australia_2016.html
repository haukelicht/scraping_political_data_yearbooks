         <p>It might not be as internationally extraordinary as Brexit or Donald Trump winning the United States Presidency, but the result of the Australian federal election of 2016 revealed a continuing and profound disaffection with both major parties. Close to one‐third of Australians cast their vote for candidates not from the Liberal‐National or Labor parties, and the final result hung in the balance for several days, hinting that a second hung parliament in six years was a very real possibility. In the end, the Turnbull government was re‐elected by the narrowest of margins (a one seat majority) in the House of Representatives. In the upper house, 20 minor and micro‐party senators were elected, including the phoenix‐like Pauline Hanson.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Federal election</h3>
            
            <p>Having won the Liberal leadership and the prime ministership from Tony Abbott in September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull's popularity remained strong early in his term as leader and his government was 5 percentage points ahead of Labor in January 2016 (AAP <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>). Initially, the prime minister indicated he expected the election would be in late 2016, but the prospect of an oppositional Senate and an uneasy backbench meant speculation about the likelihood of a double dissolution election became a common feature of Australian political commentary in early 2016.
            </p>
            
            <p>Such an election (as per section 57 of the Australian Constitution) is a mechanism to overcome legislative disagreements between the House of Representatives and the Senate. It can be triggered when legislation is passed by the House of Representatives but fails to pass the Senate, or the Senate passes the legislation with amendments that are unacceptable to the House of Representatives. Normally, only 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate are up for election, but in a double dissolution election all 76 seats are vacated (Muller, <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>By March 2016, there were four coalition government bills that met the double dissolution criteria. However, Prime Minister Turnbull chose to use only the industrial relations bills as his ‘triggers’, believing union governance and alleged corruption in the building industry to be the issues most acceptable to voters. On 21 March 2016, Turnbull announced that the parliament would be recalled for both houses to sit on 18 April to consider these bills for a third time. Because the government did not have a joint sitting majority, the bills failed to pass again and a double dissolution was thus set for 2 July (Green <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The government campaigned on messages around jobs and growth, but it had been unable to secure the passage of its budget due to the election timings, and much of the campaign was spent urging voters to avoid minor parties and independents, and fending off scare campaigns concerning health and superannuation. Despite such pleas, the result was somewhat reminiscent of the 2010 election, which had produced a hung parliament. The count took several days to finalise, and it was not until 17 days after the election that Turnbull formed a government with what would turn out to be the slimmest of majorities in the lower house: winning 76 seats for the Liberal‐National coalition in the 150 seat House of Representatives.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> House of Representatives</h3>
            
            <p>The Liberal‐National coalition government's net loss of 12 seats represented a defeat of sorts, given theirs was a first‐term government up for re‐election and one‐term governments are a rare feature in Australian politics. The swing against the government was more than 3 per cent; Labor gained less than half of that, but gained 14 seats and came within a whisper of winning the election. The trend in voting for minor parties or independents has become a feature of Australian federal politics and 2016 was no different. The Greens, micro parties, independents and others won almost a quarter of the primary votes cast, despite the preferential system making it unlikely that these candidates would win a seat.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Senate</h3>
            
            <p>In 2013, one quarter of the senators were elected from trailing positions, a result of the fact that minor and micro parties were harvesting each other's preferences rather than directing preferences to the major parties. In 2016, the Turnbull government introduced reforms to the Senate voting system that aimed to abolish this practice by allowing optional preferential voting above the line (see <b>Institutional changes</b>). However, the outcome in the Senate did not provide additional certainty for the government with the newly elected Senate containing one of the largest cross‐benches in history with 20 senators (nine Greens and 11 others, five of whom are single party members). While unsurprising given the low quota of a double dissolution election, the outcome reflects an ongoing trend towards minor party voting in the Senate, and left Turnbull with the need to negotiate his government's legislative agenda with a politically varied group of small parties and independents.

            <p>Although the federal election was the electoral ‘highlight’ of the 2016 political calendar, two territory elections were also held. The Northern Territory general election was held on 27 August 2016 to elect all 25 members of its Legislative Assembly. The incumbent Country Liberal Party (CLP) minority government was overwhelmingly defeated after just one term in office. The CLP had won 16 seats at the 2012 election, but had been reduced to 11 by election day, and was only able to retain two of those. By contrast, the Labor Party won 18 seats, making it the third largest majority government in the Territory's history. The remaining five seats were won by independents (NTEC <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Legislative Assembly election was held on 15 October 2016 and featured an increased number of seats (up from 17 to 25, elected from five rather than the previously three electorates). The election also involved an increase in the use of electronic voting facilities and continued to provide early voting facilities with a record number of voters taking up this option (similar to the federal election: 84,273, compared to 61,660 in 2012). The incumbent Labor government won 12 seats and signed a formal parliamentary agreement with the Greens, thereby winning a fifth term in office. For the first time in the Territory's history, women members hold a majority (13) of the seats in the Assembly (ACT <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).

         <p>Instability and scandal within the Turnbull government were features of the early months of 2016. Federal Trade Minister Andrew Robb and the Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss announced their retirement (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12175-tbl-0007">7</a>). Alongside this, three ministers outside cabinet were involved in high profile resignations. The reshuffle that ensued on 12 February saw an increase of one cabinet minister to include Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash, and the gender composition of the cabinet reached a new high for the Liberal‐National coalition government of 27 per cent (Taylor <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>After the election, Prime Minister Turnbull announced his new cabinet would include one extra minister (23 up from 22), and a total of 40 ministers and assistant ministers, making it one of the largest frontbenches in Australian history. However, most of the changes within cabinet were reshuffles rather than promotions, and the additional place was given to the Nationals, in recognition of their increased share of coalition House of Representatives seats. The gender composition of the cabinet returned to its January 2016 level of 24 per cent.</p>

         <p>Following the 2016 election, the gender composition of the House of Representatives increased by 3 percentage points, largely a result of the addition of seven women to the Labor caucus (reaching a total of 41 per cent). There was no change in the proportion of women elected to the Senate, although there were small changes to the gender ratio within several parties, as noted in Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12175-tbl-0006">6</a>.

State senators normally serve fixed six‐year terms and rotate, with half being elected every three years. In a double dissolution election all 76 Senators are up for re‐election. The Senate resolved that the first elected six senators in each state would serve six‐year terms and the last six would serve three‐year terms.<span class="chevronDown"></span></span>

State senators normally serve fixed six‐year terms and rotate, with half being elected every three years. In a double dissolution election all 76 Senators are up for re‐election. The Senate resolved that the first elected six senators in each state would serve six‐year terms and the last six would serve three‐year terms.

<li id="epdy12175-tbl5-note-0001">Note: The Liberal National Coalition includes the Liberal Party, the Liberal National Party (Queensland), the Nationals and the Country Liberals. In 2008, the Queensland divisions of the Nationals and Liberals merged to become the Liberal National Party of Queensland. Federally, the two parties operate as one for the purposes of the election campaign, but sit in their respective caucuses once elected. For the purposes of documenting election results the LNP is distinguished as such here. This differs from previous editions.</li>

         <p>In addition, there were several potential changes to the composition of the Senate resulting from events that occurred at the end of 2016. Family First Senator Bob Day resigned in early November after an investigation determined that he had not been validly elected (under Section 44c of the Constitution). The High Court ordered a recount and Lucy Gichuhi, also from Family First, was announced as his successor in April 2017. In December 2016, Senator Culleton resigned from Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party to sit as an independent senator. Less than a month later, Senator Culleton was disqualified from holding the position of Senator because of a declaration of bankruptcy.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12175-sec-0090-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>The Senate is elected using a closed form of single transferable voting that encourages voting for lists of party candidates, with the party being designated a position above a line on the ballot. Up until 2016, voters could choose to vote for one party above the line, or to preference all candidates below the line. Historically, most voters chose to vote above the line, meaning the preference deals negotiated between the major parties and the established minor parties, such as the Greens, determined the final outcome. In recent years, other minor and micro parties countered the disadvantages of this system for their candidates by a form of ‘preferencing harvesting’, where they had arrangements to direct their preferences to each other. Consequently, candidates from these parties were elected with a very small first preference vote.</p>
         
         <p>The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill was introduced on 22 February and focused primarily on reforming the Senate electoral system to prevent such micro party preference harvesting. The proposed legislative amendment outlined rule changes that abolished group voting tickets and replaced a single vote above the line with a requirement that voters allocate at least six preferences above the line. The bill included a savings provision that allowed voters who allocated at least one vote above the line to have their ballot paper count as formal. Below the line voting remained full preferential, but the permitted number of below the line numbering errors was increased from three to five (APL <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The vote for the bill was split along party lines, with the Coalition and the Greens in support and the ALP and most of the crossbench senators opposing change. Following the longest continuous sitting of the Senate (at almost 29 hours) the bill passed on 18 March 2016. The new act now allows for optional preferential voting both above and below the line, with voters instructed to complete at least six preferences above the line or at least 12 below the line. The retention of saving provisions allows votes that expressed fewer preferences to be counted (Muller <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>There were some concerns that the rushed passage of this legislation only three months before the federal election would confuse voters. However, early evidence suggests that around 85 per cent of voters preferenced 1 to 6 above the line (Muller <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>), and the final composition of the Senate was announced one month and two days after the election (AEC <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>). The full effect of the new voting rules on micro party representation will not be visible until after the next half Senate election in 2019, when the quota will double (from 7.7 to 14.3 per cent).

         <p>Several policy issues also continued to gain attention during 2016. The Turnbull government had promised a tax reform package, with announcements of an increase in goods and services tax followed by a proposal to enable states to raise income tax. Both options were quickly set aside, in part because they were unpalatable to both state governments and the voting public. During the election campaign, the standard issues of the economy, health and education were front and centre, and there was a momentary focus on Turnbull's connection with the Panama papers. But alongside these, the conscience issue of marriage equality continued to be a point of focus. In 2015 the Abbott government had decided that the issue of same‐sex marriage would be decided by a non‐binding referendum, rather than the parliament. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull personally supported the idea of legalising marriage equality, but many in his party did not, and he choose not to overturn Abbott's proposal. The bill to hold the referendum passed the lower house, but it failed in the Senate by 33 votes to 29, after Labor, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team voted against the bill.</p>
         
         <p>Another heated political debate focused on proposed amendments to Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act which conservative parliamentarians argued inhibited free speech. Senator Cory Bernardi introduced a private members’ bill aimed at removing the words ‘offend’ and ‘insult’ from the list of offences. The bill ultimately failed, but the conservative wing of the Liberal Party continued to challenge other socially progressive policies, including programs addressing sex education and gender identity in schools. Finally, while establishing a Royal Commission into the banking sector was an election campaign issue, it was to be a Royal Commission into Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory that the Turnbull government chose to establish in 2016 after significant abuses were aired on national television (Dunn <i>et al</i>. <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>By the end of 2016, opinion polls indicated Turnbull's rating was at its lowest level since he took over as prime minister in September 2015. A total of 46 per cent of voters disapproved of the prime minister compared to 34 per cent approval (Karp <span><a href="#epdy12175-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12175-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
