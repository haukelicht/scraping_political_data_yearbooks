         <p>J.P. Raffarin resigned on 30 March 2004, but President Jacques Chirac chose to keep the same Prime Minister and to regard, as far as public opinion was concerned, the new government as a simple reshuffle of the Raffarin II cabinet. The resignation of the Prime Minister was a consequence of local elections (regional and departmental) held on 21 and 28 March. The left‐wing camp gained 40.3 per cent of the vote cast, while the right‐wing – divided among the UMP, the UDF and the moderates – won only 35 per cent of the electorate. Moreover, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party and the Greens obtained, in the second round, a majority in 21 out of 22 regions (compared to 8 in 1998).</p>
         
         <p>Surveys showed that the government was consistently very unpopular. According to <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">SOFRES</a></span>, in February, only 33 per cent of those interviewed were confident in ‘the ability of the Prime Minister to handle the problems that France has to face’; in March, the figure was 31 per cent. Exit polls confirmed that the French opposed the government on many issues, particularly unemployment and upholding the welfare state, but also globalisation, delocalisation and enlargement of the European Union (EU) to include the new Eastern European countries. In fact, the electorate expressed a ‘sanction vote’ that characterises many ‘second order elections’, but here it had a precise sense: fears about the consequences of the policies implemented by the government since 2002 (pensions, reform of social protection, changes in the education system, even regionalisation – the main reform implemented in 2004 in order to ‘modernize’ the French state).
         </p>
         
         <p>The composition of the new government was an attempt to demonstrate that President Chirac had heeded the concerns of the citizenry. The Cabinet (including junior ministers) was very large (42 posts). Many positions were created in order to reflect the social concerns of the electorate: the family, poverty and social exclusion, and the disabled. The new course was placed under the new slogan of ‘social cohesion’, which sounded like a rewording of the ‘social gap’ (‘<i>fracture sociale</i>’) slogan of Chirac's 1995 presidential campaign.
         </p>
         
         <p>This new course did not convince the UDF to participate in the government. Given that many ministers of the Raffarin II Cabinet having no political affiliation and representing so‐called ‘civil society’ did not retain their posts, the Raffarin Government only reflected the UMP. As shown by the results of the European elections, the electorate was not very confident in the ability of the government to implement policies that would fit with their demands. The PS won 28.9 per cent of the vote, its best score in the history of European elections; the UMP gained only 16.6 per cent. If the UMP managed to contain the influence of the ‘<i>souverainists</i>’, divided and without a national leader, it could not prevent the UDF (11.9 per cent) from gaining votes in comparison to the regional elections or the previous (1999) European elections. The strategy of F. Bayrou, the president of the UDF – generally to support the government within the National Assembly, but not to appear as a member of a ruling coalition – received increased support from a section of the right‐wing electorate.
         </p>
         
         <p>The results of the local and European elections opened, within the UMP, a debate about the policies to be implemented. The UMP appeared to be divided between those confident in Chirac's ‘social cohesion’ and another component that argued that, in fact, France has to move from more or less ‘social democratic’ policies – even backed by Gaullism and its heirs – to true liberal solutions.</p>
         
         <p>This faction had to promote a leader. N. Sarkozy, the Minister of Economy and Finance, appeared to be the right man in the right post. One could argue that Sarkozy had personal ambitions – to become President of the Republic in 2007 – but his political line could also be interpreted as a claim for clear liberal policies. Therefore a debate arose in the second half of the year focusing on the relations between the President and his minister. If Sarkozy hoped to run in the next presidential election, he had great interest in becoming the leader of the UMP. The presidency of the party having been made free by the resignation of A. Juppé, Sarkozy was immediately a candidate (16 July). Previously, President Chirac argued (14 July) that a president of the UMP could not be a minister at the same time. Unknown in the history of the RPR (including Chirac himself), this rule changed the equilibrium of French institutions: a President, his Prime Minister, his parliamentary majority and the support of a party that had only to agree with the policies implemented.</p>
         
         <p>Elected on 21 November by 85.1 per cent of UMP militants as President of the UMP, Sarkozy resigned as Minister of Economy and Finance. The government reshuffle (29 November) promoted ‘chiracian’ personalities. However, it was clear that the UMP escaped from Chirac's influence. This was so true that Sarkozy argued for new party rules: programmatic function; designation of the candidates for all elections by the adherents; support for the government, but also ‘freedom of thought, speech and proposals’.</p>
         
         <p>The third issue of the year was European. On 14 July, President Chirac announced that the proposed Treaty for a European Constitution would be submitted to popular decision via a referendum. The French agreed with the idea of a referendum and seemed decided to ratify the Treaty (61 per cent voted ‘yes’ in the referendum in September). Some political parties (the far left, Communists, extreme right) campaigned for a ‘no’ vote. The more striking event, however, was the division of the Socialist Party. The ‘leftist’ factions within the party emphasised that the economic part of the Constitution was too oriented toward liberalism. However, they received unexpected support when L. Fabius, well known as a long‐time European in his political positions regarding European integration, announced that he would campaign for a ‘no’ vote. The opponents to the Treaty asked their party to organise an ‘internal referendum’. They were defeated, with 58 per cent of the Socialist adherents choosing a ‘yes’ vote.</p>
         
         <p>In short, one can emphasise a French ‘malaise’: a Constitution and a balance between the powers that does not work well; a majority party divided not only on political issues, but also on its relations with the President; an unpopular government; an opposition represented mainly by the Socialist Party, victorious in the elections, but without a programme and seemingly very divided on the European issue.</p>
