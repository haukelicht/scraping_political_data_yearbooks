         <p>The major events of United Kingdom politics in 2011 were the referendum on changing the voting system for general elections; elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies; the News International phone‐hacking scandal; and divisions within the coalition government on a range of issues. The year also saw disagreements within the Conservative Party over European integration, and the economic situation continued to be unfavourable with increases in unemployment and inflation. Unusually, Parliament was recalled twice during the summer – the first time due to the phone‐hacking saga and the second because of riots that broke out in English cities during August. On top of this, the government suffered a cabinet minister's resignation and two former parliamentarians were jailed for false expenses claims.</p>
         
         <p>Labour began the year with a poll lead of around four to five points over the Conservatives with the Liberal Democrats' support moving between roughly 7 and 12 per cent. There was little in the way of dramatic change in these numbers during the year, apart from a spike in Conservative support after David Cameron vetoed the draft European Union fiscal pact in December, discussed in more detail below. But by the end of the year, polls showed the two largest parties very close together (UK Polling Report, 30 December <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0012" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0012R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"></a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The economy continued to struggle during 2011. Inflation had reached 5.2 per cent in September – its highest point since September 2008, although it fell during the last months of 2011. Figures released in December showed unemployment of 8.3 per cent or 2.64 million – the highest number since 1994. The economy shrank in both the second and fourth quarters of the year with only weak growth in the other two.</p>
         
         <p>Perhaps the most significant political event in the first part of the year was the referendum on changing the system of electing MPs from single member plurality to the alternative vote (AV) system. The referendum itself nearly had to be postponed because of delays in getting the relevant bill through the House of Lords. The principal political concerns, which contributed to a 21‐hour long session in the upper house in January, were first, whether the bill itself should be split into two, allowing separate consideration of the other major element of the proposals, the reduction in the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and associated rules for re‐drawing constituency boundaries. Second, some parliamentarians were unhappy with the proposed date of the referendum as it fell on the same day as elections to the legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as some local government and mayoral elections. The argument was that voters and parties alike would be more likely to concentrate on the issue at stake if the referendum were held separately from elections. A third sticking point concerned the amount of opportunities for the public to have an input into the process of deciding on new constituency boundaries, something that was resolved in early February when the government altered the bill to allow for public hearings on boundary revisions. The proposals ping‐ponged between the Lords and Commons, largely due to disagreement about whether the referendum should require a 40 per cent turnout in order to be binding – a condition that was applied to the referendum on Scottish devolution in 1979. However, the Lords backed down in the face of resistance from MPs and the bill became law on 16 February, only just in time for the referendum to be held on 5 May. The Boundary Commission's initial plans for the new parliamentary constituencies were published in September and left many MPs, including some senior members, with much uncertainty about their ability to win seats at the next general election.</p>
         
         <p>Just before the legislative ping‐pong finished, the ‘No2AV’ campaign was launched (on 15 February) and drew support from Conservative and some Labour politicians, among others. Over a month later, at the end of March, the cross‐party ‘Yes to Fairer Votes’ campaign was launched with Labour leader Ed Miliband, former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy and leader of the Greens, Caroline Lucas, among others on the platform. Miliband refused to have Nick Clegg present at the event, fearing it would contribute to voters making decisions based on their opinion of the Liberal Democrat leader rather than on the issue at stake. The Liberal Democrats campaigned in favour and Conservatives against the change, with Labour somewhat split over the issue. The main arguments centred around the extent to which the AV system would be fairer and might make MPs work harder by requiring candidates to attract 50 per cent of the vote in order to be elected; whether it would make coalition governments more likely and thus empower Liberal Democrat leaders in future; how costly it might be to implement; and the degree to which it would undermine the principle of one‐person‐one‐vote.</p>
         
         <p>While there were fluctuations in the polls during the early part of the year, the lead for the ‘no’ campaign grew during the final month before the vote alongside a decline in the proportion of undecided voters (Whiteley et al. <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 304). The campaign's most intense period, during April, was at times rather ill‐tempered with Liberal Democrat Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne demanding to know whether Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron supported literature from the anti‐AV campaign in which Nick Clegg was derided. This was indicative of the tension brought to bear between the coalition partners, something that was only exacerbated by other areas of the government's activity (discussed later).
         </p>
         
         <p>The result saw a clear victory for those campaigning against the change to AV with 68 per cent voting ‘no’ (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy35-tbl-0001">1</a>). Turnout was 42 per cent, over 20 points lower than that in both the 2010 general election and the last national referendum, held in 1975 on membership of the EU. Analysis of voting suggested that opinions on the pros and cons of the electoral system were the biggest factor explaining the decision to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’, while views of party leaders also had a considerable effect. Those with higher levels of political knowledge and education were more likely to vote in favour of the change (Whiteley et al. <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 316). Survey data suggested few voters were enthused by either the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ campaigns (Whiteley et al. <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 318). The campaign left relations between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats strained and the result led many to conclude that voting reform would be off the political agenda for some time to come.

         <p>Local elections held on the same day as the referendum provided the first test of the parties since the general election other than in by‐elections. Labour performed best and, of the two coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats suffered by far the more heavily with the Conservatives making small net gains. The BBC's national projected share of the vote gave Labour 37 per cent, the Conservatives 35 per cent and the Liberal Democrats only 15 per cent. The latter party lost control of nine councils and gained none while making a net loss of 748 councillors. This compared with net gains of three councils for the Conservatives and 27 for Labour. Mayoral elections also took place in five English cities, including Leicester for the first time, where former Leicester South Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby won.</p>
         
         <p>Elections to the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly were held on the same day as the referendum and the local elections. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) converted their minority administration into a single party majority, quite a feat under a form of proportional representation (the additional member system). The SNP's vote share rose by 11 points compared to the 2007 election and they won 22 more seats. The Conservatives and Labour both lost just under three points, while the Liberal Democrats' proportion of the vote was more than half of its 2007 level at only 6.6 per cent, leaving them with 12 fewer seats (Sandford &amp; Hardacre <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-9001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-9001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). The result was significant not only in that this was the first single‐party majority in the Scottish Parliament but it also paved the way for a referendum on Scottish independence. Debates about the date for this were to heat up at the start of 2012.
         </p>
         
         <p>In elections to the National Assembly for Wales, Labour gained just under nine points in vote share on their 2007 result, taking them to 39.6 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives who finished second and gained just under two points. Both Plaid Cymru (PC) and the Liberal Democrats performed worse than in 2007, with the Lib Dems losing four points of vote share – more than any other party (Hawkins 2011). The distribution of seats meant that Labour were able to form a single‐party minority government, having won half of the 60 places in the Assembly. Previously, Labour had been in coalition with PC. These elections were preceded by a referendum in Wales on 3 March on granting full legislative powers to the Welsh Assembly in specific policy areas. The vote was comfortably won with 63.5 per cent voting in favour of the change on a turnout of 35.6 per cent. The new powers became available to the Assembly after elections on 5 May (University College London, Constitution Unit <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-9003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-9003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Prior to the elections in Northern Ireland, a Catholic member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland was killed by a bomb placed under his car on 2 April in Omagh. In the elections, there was very little change in the distribution of seats among parties in the Assembly. The Democratic Unionists (DUP) and Sinn Féin finished in first and second places, respectively, with gains of two seats for the DUP and one for Sinn Féin (Cracknell &amp; Hardacre <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-9004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-9004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>.
         </p>
         
         <p>With the exception of Northern Ireland, where a different party system operates, the overriding theme of these elections as well as the referendum was one of poor results for the Liberal Democrats. Their poll ratings remained low throughout 2011.</p>
         
         <p>Another major political story of the year concerned the implications for the government of the News International phone‐hacking scandal. The story stretched back to allegations in the mid‐2000s that journalists working for Rupert Murdoch's News International had hacked into voicemail messages in order to obtain information for stories. This led to the <i>News of the World</i>'s royal editor and a private investigator being jailed in 2007 for illegally accessing voicemails on the phones of some members of the royal family. Following this, the newspaper's editor, Andy Coulson, resigned but insisted that he had not been aware of phone‐hacking. A few months later, in May 2007, he was appointed by Conservative Party leader David Cameron, as his director of communications. By 2009 allegations were being made that several thousand people had had their voicemails intercepted by journalists at the <i>News of the World</i>. The problem for Cameron was the suggestion made by many that Coulson must have known about what was happening at the paper if phone‐hacking was as widespread as alleged. Such was the pressure on Coulson that he resigned from his post as Director of Government Communications in January 2011.

         <p>By the early summer the story was dominating the news and had also begun to encompass the police. Sir Paul Stephenson, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, resigned on 17 July following criticism of his decision to hire a former <i>News of the World</i> executive, Neil Wallis, as an advisor. Stephenson increased the pressure on Cameron by noting that Wallis had not resigned from News International, while Coulson had done so. Stephenson also said that he had chosen not to inform Cameron that Wallis had been employed by the Metropolitan Police for fear of compromising the Prime Minister because of Wallis's close relationship with Coulson. Cameron was out of the United Kingdom at this point but cut short his trade trip to South Africa to recall Parliament for 20 July. He said he regretted having appointed Coulson and would not have done so with hindsight. This was perhaps the lowest point of Cameron's premiership by that time, with some Labour MPs suggesting he consider his position. Cameron gave details of an inquiry to be set up into phone‐hacking – namely the Leveson Inquiry, which began its work in November.
         </p>
         
         <p>One of the more significant players in these events was the Culture, Media and Sport select committee of the House of Commons, which held very high profile hearings with Rupert and James Murdoch, and Rebekah Brooks, former head of News International, on 19 July. The Murdochs had originally said they would not be able to attend but were forced to do so after Parliament issued a summons. The Home Affairs select committee held similarly high profile sessions with senior members of the Metropolitan Police in the same week. At least for a period of time, these meetings gave Commons select committees huge exposure, something that, with a few exceptions, they have struggled to achieve in the past.</p>
         
         <p>While the story ran on into 2012 with the appearance of senior figures from the media, celebrities and politicians at the Leveson Inquiry, other significant events, requiring another recall of Parliament, took place during August. In Tottenham, north London, riots broke out on the evening of 6 August after the police shot a man dead while attempting to arrest him. What had begun as a peaceful protest had turned violent by the end of the evening. The following night saw similar riots and looting in other parts of London. Over the next two nights, the riots spread to other cities including Birmingham and Manchester, but had largely come to an end by 10 August. The government was criticised for losing control of the situation in some locations and being too slow in generating a police response. Arguments abounded over whether the government or the police should take the blame for not containing the riots earlier. This contributed to a poor summer for the government and one in which there had been far more political news than would normally be expected.</p>
         
         <p>The government's plans to reform the National Health Service tested the strength of the coalition partners' relationship, with much opposition being expressed among Liberal Democrats. Further resistance came from unions representing medical professionals. The legislation planned to give doctors much more power in deciding how NHS funds are spent, to allow more competition for the provision of NHS services and reduce bureaucracy. Some in the Liberal Democrats were particularly concerned about the extent to which the changes would extend the involvement of private sector providers and create more of a market in the provision of health services as well as the transparency of decision making regarding commissioning. The Royal College of Nurses and the British Medical Association (representing doctors) both opposed the legislation. This pressure led the government to take an unusual step by putting the legislative process on pause for a period of nearly two months. The Health and Social Care bill had already passed its second reading and was undergoing its committee stage in the House of Commons when a temporary halt was called. At this point, the government set up the NHS Future Forum to gain views from NHS staff, the public and trade unions, among others. A series of amendments were then tabled by the government when the bill returned to its committee stage towards the end of June. Nick Clegg claimed that the Liberal Democrats' political demands had been ‘handsomely met’ in the revised version of the bill, something that riled some Conservative MPs, with Nick de Bois among others expressing frustration that the timetable for handing over the commissioning of services to doctors would be loosened (politics.co.uk, 8 June <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). The bill completed its stages in the Commons in September, albeit with some dissenting votes among Liberal Democrat MPs (revolts.co.uk, 8 September <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>), and had reached committee stage in the Lords by the end of 2011, going on to be passed in March 2012.
         </p>
         
         <p>Backbenchers in the two governing parties were at odds over other issues during the year. Nick Clegg's plans for reform of the House of Lords, which were announced via a white paper and draft bill in May, were received rather critically in the Commons and the Lords, with signs that the united front presented by Cameron and Clegg was not representative of feelings among some Conservative backbenchers. Existing differences between the two parties over the Human Rights Act were brought to the surface during the annual party conferences in September, when Nick Clegg told his party that the Act was ‘here to stay’ while Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May reiterated her view that it should be scrapped.</p>
         
         <p>The parties' differences over European integration were also brought into focus by two events: a backbench motion in Parliament and Cameron's actions at a European Union (EU) summit in December. In October, the Commons Backbench Business committee brought forward a motion, opposed by the government, calling for a referendum on United Kingdom membership of the EU and on the terms of such membership. The motion was partly a response to large numbers of people having signed petitions on the government's own e‐petitions website supporting a referendum on this issue. It was also an example of the Backbench Business committee using its limited scheduling powers to bring something onto the agenda that the government, and particularly the Conservative leadership, did not want to face at that particular time. Such were their concerns that ministers arranged for the debate to be brought forward a few days to ensure that David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague were able to take part. The closing words of Cameron's speech in which he declared a desire ‘to re‐fashion our membership of the EU so that it better serves our nation's interests’, and his statement that ‘The time for reform is coming. That is the prize’ (Commons Debates, 24 October <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>, col. 27), made for rather uncomfortable listening for the pro‐integration Liberal Democrats.
         </p>
         
         <p>The vote saw the largest postwar rebellion on European integration in any British party (Cowley &amp; Stuart <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>), with 81 Conservative dissenters, amounting to 27 per cent of the parliamentary party (Lynch &amp; Whitaker <span title=""><a href="#epdy35-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy35-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>), supporting the motion. By contrast, only one Liberal Democrat MP voted against the government line. The motion was easily defeated overall, but it had demonstrated the strength of feeling on this issue among many Conservative backbenchers.
         </p>
         
         <p>Perhaps partly inspired by this, David Cameron took the decision at a meeting of the European Council on 8–9 December to refuse United Kingdom support for a draft ‘fiscal compact’ committing the EU Member States to enshrining the requirement of balanced budgets in national law and allowing the European Court of Justice to fine countries not adopting such a rule. Under the treaty, Member States with excessive deficits would have to submit plans to reduce their debt for endorsement by the European Commission and Council of the EU, and major economic policy reforms should be discussed before being enacted and coordinated with other Member States where appropriate. Cameron explained his choice on the basis that he had not been able to secure sufficient safeguards on the single market and financial services within the treaty. Nick Clegg's decision to absent himself from the Commons when Cameron made his statement about the summit only seemed to draw further attention to the divisions between the coalition partners on the issue.</p>
         
         <p>In other troubles for the government, allegations were made in May that Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne had asked someone else to take points on their driving licence resulting from a speeding offence that occurred while he was driving. The Prime Minister expressed his confidence in Huhne, who continued in his post, but the story was to re‐appear early in 2012 with greater consequences. In October, Defence Secretary Liam Fox resigned amid revelations that a friend, Adam Werritty, had styled himself as a special advisor and attended various meetings with military, diplomatic and defence industry figures despite having no official role. In a continuation of the expenses scandal, former Labour MP Elliot Morley was sentenced in May to 16 months in jail for claiming over £30,000 in false mortgage payments. In the same month, Conservative peer Lord Taylor was imprisoned for 12 months for false parliamentary expense claims.</p>
         
         <p>In foreign policy, the United Kingdom contributed to military forces implementing United Nations Resolution 1973 on protecting Libyan civilians between March and October 2011.</p>

         <p>There were three by‐elections for the House of Commons in 2011, all of which resulted in Labour holds. The first, Oldham East and Saddleworth in January, was held due to a court's decision that the 2010 victor, Phil Woolas, had made inaccurate assertions about the Liberal Democrat candidate. The second, in Barnsley Central in March, at which the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) finished second, came as a result of the resignation of Labour MP Eric Illsley after he pleaded guilty to falsely claiming parliamentary expenses. The third took place in December in Feltham and Heston following the death of the incumbent MP Alan Keen in November.</p>
