         <p>One of the prominent themes in the November 2007 elections was the conditions within the asylum centres for Iraqis who had been denied asylum but not repatriated due to security concerns. This attention was particularly focused on their children, as many believed they were being traumatised by the conditions they were being forced to endure. In January, the Government reached an agreement with the Danish People's Party allowing asylum seekers with children from Somalia, Iran, Iraq or Kosovo, who had been denied asylum but nevertheless remained in an asylum centre for more than three years and had received Red Cross approval, to move to housing outside of the asylum centres. The agreement could include a maximum of 50 families.</p>
         
         <p>On 21 January, however, independent MP Pia Christmas‐Møller was able to gather a majority consisting of the Social Democrats, the Socialist People's Party, the Danish Social‐Liberal Party, the Unity List, New Alliance and the two MPs from Greenland in support of a proposal demanding the reduction of the three‐year requirement to two years and that the Government should call the parties in the Folketing to negotiations about further improvements for the rejected asylum seekers and a multi‐year asylum accord.</p>
         
         <p>The Prime Minister clearly stated that if there was a majority against the Government, an election would be called. He achieved two things with this declaration. First, he made it obvious that he had no intention of returning to classic, 1980s‐style Danish minority parliamentarism, where the government of the day accepted being in the minority on important policy areas without stepping back or calling an election. Second, he strengthened his hand in the negotiations he was conducting with New Alliance since the latter was clearly under the election threshold in the opinion polls.</p>
         
         <p>The atmosphere in the Folketing was therefore a highly charged one when it assembled for the preliminary debate on 23 January, especially after an announcement by the Prime Minister that New Alliance now supported the Government and that the party would be invited to negotiations addressing the conditions endured by asylum seekers. New Alliance's jumping ship ensured majority support for the Government, and the opposition parties reacted with a combination of anger, disbelief and derision. They had difficulty seeing what New Alliance had actually achieved other than being invited to negotiations. The Danish People's Party were violently opposed to this development, firm in the belief that it was meaningless to re‐open the negotiations about the agreement they had with the Government, but the parliamentary imperative rendered it necessary.</p>
         
         <p>The negotiations with the Minister of Integration began on 29 January, but they were totally overshadowed by developments in New Alliance. That very day, Gitte Seeberg, one of the three founding members of the party, announced that she was leaving the party to become an independent MP. She disagreed with the political course the party had now decided to follow – that is, to be a right‐of‐centre, ‘bourgeois’ party that supported the Government instead of serving as a bourgeois party in the middle of the spectrum, which could stand free and choose to support proposals from both sides of the Folketing.</p>
         
         <p>On 5 February, New Alliance group secretary Malou Aamund announced that she, too, was leaving the party. She chose to join Venstre in the Folketing. The VKO‐bloc had thereby re‐established a narrow majority without the aid of New Alliance. The party was out for the count, with its three remaining MPs (Naser Khader, Anders Samuelsen and Jørgen Poulsen) declaring that they required a pause for thought and a vacation to consider the future of the party. This break resulted in a change in course, which was presented to the less than 300 participants in the party's first national assembly in May. The Danish People's Party was no longer the arch enemy – that position had been taken by all of the reform‐minded parties. Denmark was to be reformed in a more liberal direction. This received general support among the delegates. The party was able to pass the party regulations, Leif Mikkelsen was elected as the national party chairman, and there was a generally optimistic and confident spirit in the air.</p>
         
         <p>However, there were also tiffs. For one of the three remaining MPs, Jørgen Poulsen, the Danish People's Party remained ‘public enemy number one’, and he was a strong opponent of an ultra‐liberal party line. This lack of agreement led to his exclusion from the parliamentary group in June. The remaining party leadership attempted to reconstruct the party and renamed it Liberal Alliance in August. In the long run, party leader Naser Khader could not accept this turn of events. Khader left the party, ultimately joining the Conservative People's Party in the beginning of 2009. Given that the formation of New Alliance in May 2007 had held out the prospect of a major shift in country's party‐political geography, the result was a clear fiasco: the party had no influence and the parliamentary balance of power prior to the 2007 election remained untouched.</p>
         
         <p>The Government's proposed budget for 2008, put forward in August 2007, no longer applied in light of the election called in 2007. The proposal put forward in February was slightly tighter in terms of finance policy. The opposition claimed it showed that the Government's campaign promises – for increased welfare and tax relief – were pure bluff and empty electioneering. A broad settlement was out of the question, and the Government had little choice – as had been the case in the previous years – but to seek the support of the Danish People's Party. The negotiations proceeded in a relatively pain‐free manner, and a settlement was reached in March. The same course of events played out for the autumn negotiations for the 2009 budget, where a settlement was reached in November. All told, the course of events surrounding the budget was little different from previous years for the Government and opposition alike: shifts in party geography, the election, the independent MPs and party defections had not had an impact on the fundamental patterns of cooperation in the Folketing.</p>
         
         <p>The budget is a fundamental element in the traditional left‐right spectrum in Danish politics, but this spectrum no longer stands alone. The new politics dimension has attained increasing significance for the electorate when they decide who to vote for and for the political parties when they are formulating their policy and finding their respective positions in relation to one another. Once again, new politics provided occasion for conflict in 2008. This concerned, among other things, a judgment passed by the European Court of Justice in July regarding the rights of European Union citizens to family reunification and free movement. This judgment meant that numerous central elements in the Danish rules for family reunification and the restrictive Danish immigration policy were in conflict with the EU and therefore had to be reformed. The Danish People's Party opposed this, but was forced to go along with a number of modifications in a settlement with the Government in September.</p>
         
         <p>Leading up to the 2007 elections, there was lively debate in the Folketing as to whether headscarves could be worn by those addressing the Folketing. This debate was sparked by a candidate from the Unity List who had declared that she intended to wear her headscarf should she be elected, which appeared to be a distinct possibility at the time. She was not elected, but the question had been raised and the executive committee (Folketingets Præsidium) decided in April that MPs were to be allowed to wear a headscarf while speaking in the Folketing, as long as they can be recognised.</p>
         
         <p>This headscarf case had hardly been settled – and certainly not to the satisfaction of everyone – before a new, related case emerged. This time it was ultimately about the headwear to be worn by any person in a position of public authority. The court administration (Domstolsstyrelsen) had decided that there was nothing wrong with Danish court employees wearing headscarves. This raised consternation at the top of the Government, where the position was that possible rules on the area ought to include a ban on all religious and political symbols. There was internal dissent in several parties as well as between the Government and the Danish People's Party, which argued that the ban should only be on headscarves and not other religious symbols, and that the ban should also be in effect for all persons of authority – not just judges. In the course of the debate, the Minister of Integration clashed with the Danish People's Party, which she accused of demagogy, just as she publicly defended the right of Muslims to wear headscarves. When the Government reached an agreement with the Danish People's Party about a ban on judges wearing religious and political symbols, this raised the question as to whether she could remain as minister. She chose to accept government policy and avoided being stripped of her portfolio.</p>
         
         <p>In September, Conservative leader Bendt Bendtsen chose to step down as party leader and minister. A minor government reshuffle was carried out, the most significant political consequence of which was that new Conservative leader Lene Espersen was expected to provide the Conservatives with a pronounced boost in terms of voter support. This was also reflected in opinion polls in the first months, but eventually evened out. Espersen's new position was also a clear signal that the Conservatives were interested in changing their position as the junior partner in the government coalition. With Espersen at the helm of the Conservative Party, Denmark now had four female party leaders.</p>
         
         <p>A somewhat unusual event in Danish political party history occurred on 28 January. The Centre Democrats (Centrum‐Demokraterne) formally decided to disband the party. This decision was made by the party delegates at an extraordinary national assembly. The party had 320 members at the time. It is rare in Danish politics, that a birthday (7 November 1973) and date of death (28 January 2008) for a political party are so identifiable. The norm is for parties to gradually wither away and disappear into oblivion.</p>
         
         <p>There was another unusual event in Danish political party history on 8 February. Here, the Copenhagen District Court decided in favour of two former members of the Danish People's Party, that their exclusion from the party on the grounds of conduct to the detriment of the party was invalid. The leadership of a political party is not supreme in such cases, as they are subordinate to the ordinary rules for associations, which among other things mean that members have to be heard before any decision about exclusion can be made and the presentation of evidence must be in order.</p>
         
         <p>As the ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty progressed in the EU countries, it gradually became clear that it was necessary to clarify the significance of the Danish opt‐outs. The Government commenced negotiations with the Social Democrats, the Danish Social‐Liberal Party, New Alliance and the Socialist People's Party as to how and when referenda were to take place. In past referenda, recommendations from the Socialist People's Party to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ had proven to be decisive. There was a shift in the party's EU policy. A clear majority in an assembly of the executive committee in February provided the party leader with free reign to negotiate with the Prime Minister in order to achieve the best possible result regarding the abolition of the opt‐out pertaining to Justice and Home Affairs, just as he received support to get rid of the military opt‐out under certain conditions. The negotiations continued while the Danish media were occupied by rumours that Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen was in the process of positioning himself for a top post in the EU or NATO, and that he was saying one thing about the Danish opt‐outs when abroad and something else when at home.</p>
         
         <p>There was a massive majority in the Folketing to avoid a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, which effectively suffocated the debate on it. On 24 April, the Folketing passed and approved the Treaty on the strength of all of the parties with the exception of the Danish People's Party, the Unity List and a few Socialist People's Party MPs. This proceeded in the absence of any considerable debate and media attention and – rather symptomatically – in the absence of the Prime Minister. The situation was quite different in terms of debate and media attention in Ireland leading up to the referendum on 13 June. The Treaty was rejected, effectively breaking the ratification process. The negotiations on the Danish opt‐outs were therefore also set on standby until the destiny of the Treaty was clarified.</p>
         
         <p>The year 2008 began with prospects for an unstable parliamentary situation. Before long, however, the situation prior to the 2007 elections was restored thanks to the meltdown of New Alliance. The opposition was not able to create a united alternative to the Government. The Socialist People's Party in particular began to make itself felt, but there were rather diverging positions separating the parties on significant policy areas. For example, the Social‐Liberal Party, which was suffering in the opinion polls, did not feel that the Socialist People's Party was financially responsible and could be trusted with the powers of government. This position was softened slightly towards the end of the year, however, leading to the defection of one of the party's MPs. New politics continued to hold a central position in the political debate, and it remained important for the political parties – particularly those positioned in the middle of the Danish political spectrum – to find their position in relation to the electorate. By the end of the year, however, more traditional issues were being nudged up the political agenda by the financial crisis and declining markets.</p>
