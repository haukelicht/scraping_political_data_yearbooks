         <p>The general election in November 2001 resulted in a seat distribution in the parliament that gave the new government the realistic option to pass legislation by cooperating either with the Danish People's Party or with the Social Democratic Party. As between these alternatives, the entire political situation up to the calling of the election, the developments during the election campaign, the defeat of the Social Democratic Party and victory for the Danish People's Party all indicated that the Government would have to base its policy on support from the Danish People's Party. Entering 2002, the question was how this party would handle the change from being in a position where it could follow a competitive strategy of irresponsible opposition and a politics of outbidding into a position where it was the decisive supporting party for the government. A second question was to what extent the government actually would base its policy solely on Danish People's Party or seriously try to cooperate with the Social Democratic Party. A third question was whether the latter, now placed in opposition, would pursue a strategy of cooperation or confrontation.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>A first test was the passing of the annual state budget for 2002, which had been postponed due to the election. After a ritual round of discussions with all parties, the new Liberal‐Conservative Government ended up negotiating only with the Danish People's Party. On 7 February, they reached an agreement that was in full accord with the Governmental programme published in December 2001 (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 946). The politically crucial point, however, was not so much the economic content of the budget, but the fact that for the first time since its founding in 1995 the Danish People's Party voted ‘yes’ to the annual budget, thereby achieving influence on the general content of economic and social policy. Furthermore, none of the centre parties were included in the agreement. For the first time since 1928, the state budget was passed with only the support of parties to the right of the centre.
         </p>
         
         <p>Questions of tightening the rules regulating immigration, residence permits, asylum and how better to integrate those already living in Denmark into Danish national, social and political culture had been among the top issues during the election campaign. In January, the Government presented a number of proposals. Because a substantial tightening of the rules was the issue <i>par excellence</i> for the Danish People's Party, it was crucial for the Government to try to reach an agreement with this party. An agreement that also included the Social Democratic Party seemed not to be a realistic option, partly because the Social Democrats still showed internal disagreement on how to position itself on this issue, and partly because the distance between them and the Danish People's Party in general was too wide. Only the Danish People's Party, then, was invited to serious negotiations with the Government. In May, an agreement was reached and comprehensive legislation was passed with the support of the Danish People's Party. The rest of the parties voted against.
         </p>
         
         <p>Besides these two important complexes of legislation, the Government also reached agreements with the Danish People's Party alone on a number of other, but not quite so important, policy questions. The first half of 2002 was thus characterised by the new government's resolute use of the momentum of the election campaign; the new and, in the Danish context, unusual political configuration; the willingness of the Danish People's Party to enter into politically binding compromises with the Government; and a somewhat bewildered and weak opposition.</p>
         
         <p>The general picture of cooperation and conflict changed somewhat in the second half of 2002. The Government managed to include the Social Democratic Party in a number of agreements, some of them together with the Danish People's Party, a political outcome that had been unthinkable just a year before. In October a compromise was reached on a reform of parts of the labour market legislation. The intention of the reform was to activate the unemployed by introducing further incentives to take any job instead of remaining on public allowances. A compromise was also reached in October regarding a reform of the universities. The main aim of the reform was to strengthen the leadership of the universities by installing appointed leaders on all levels (president, deans, heads of departments) in place of leaders elected by the staff. Furthermore, a compromise was reached in an effort to reduce the housing shortage. In November, after some disagreements between the Liberals and the Conservatives, a compromise was reached regarding a revision of the Primary Education Act. The central element of the reform was the introduction of binding curricula decided upon at the state level (the Conservative standpoint) instead of, as traditional, at the municipal level (the Liberal standpoint). Politically, the compromise was historic in the sense that, for the first time since the beginning of the twentieth century, the Social Liberal Party did not support the Primary Education Act. The new power configuration in Parliament manifested itself gradually in various important policy areas.</p>
         
         <p>The willingness of the parties to enter into compromises across the centre was not extended to the passing of the annual budget for 2003. Once again, the Government reached a compromise only with the Danish People's Party. On top of the compromise, they announced a binding political understanding that none of the three parties could present proposals that would increase or decrease the main entries in the budget without the consent of all of them. The Danish People's Party had gained a decisive influence on general economic and social policy.</p>
         
         <p>During the second half of 2003, the Government was not challenged strongly by a coherent and collaborating opposition. Part of the explanation for this was the indecisive performance of the Social Democratic Party, the largest opposition party. Immediately after the electoral defeat and loss of governmental power, the Social Democratic Party leader, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, as well as the entire top leadership team, was challenged. An internal leadership struggle took place. The chairman was not able to gather sufficient support for his proposals to modernise and rejuvenate the party organisation and policy platform. Time and again, he and his supporters were blocked or defeated outright by different groupings in the party. Furthermore, his opponents were far from convinced that he had the personal qualifications to appeal to the voters. In September, he barely survived the party conference and, in November, enough was enough. He announced his resignation as party chairman. In his place, Mogens Lykketoft was elected at an extraordinary party conference, but the decision was made <i>de facto</i> by the parliamentary group – a fact that aroused much annoyance among the rank‐and‐file in the party organisation.
         </p>
         
         <p>After the historic election in November 2001, and the major changes in the parliamentary situation following it, one could expect some sort of afterthoughts and reactions from the voters. Yet the opinion polls all displayed stable support for the parties during 2002, perhaps indicating that a permanent change of the configuration of the Danish party system had taken place.</p>
