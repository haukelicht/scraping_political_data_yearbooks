         <p>Irish politics in 2013 was focused on successfully managing the national finances and banking debt towards the goal of a smooth exit from the European Union/International Monetary Fund bail‐out programme in December. A controversial law to codify the state's constitutional position on abortion was passed and a referendum to abolish the upper house of parliament was defeated.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Referendums</h3>
            
            <p>Two national referendums were held on 4 October. One question considered the establishment of a Court of Appeal and the other the abolition of Ireland's upper house of parliament, <i>Seanad Éireann</i>. The latter received significantly more political, media and voter attention.
            </p>
            
            <p>The proposal to abolish the <i>Seanad</i> originated in a dinner speech by the <i>Taoiseach</i> while still leader of the opposition in late 2009. He promised that <i>Fine Gael</i> (FG) in government would put a referendum to the people on whether to abolish the <i>Seanad</i>. The <i>Seanad</i> is an unusual entity. It is indirectly elected and has little power, and also contains some oddities such as seats reserved for graduates of some universities. The proposal was in some ways an attempt by Enda Kenny to get more media attention for himself and his party, as their Labour Party rivals were seen to be capitalising on the collapse of <i>Fianna Fáil</i> (FF) during the crisis to a greater extent. When most other pre‐election promises fell by the wayside, the <i>Taoiseach</i> stuck rigidly to this promise and refused calls to consider a ‘preferendum’ which gave people the options of retention, reform or abolition of the <i>Seanad</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>The campaign was quite vibrant, with each of the parties taking a strategic position on the issue and civil society groups such as Democracy Matters and One House holding meetings across the country to explain the implications of the referendum to voters. Although all of the the political parties except FF supported abolition, the parties framed their positions in considerably different ways. In an attempt to appeal to Irish voters' recession‐induced sense of frugality, FG perhaps cynically argued that scrapping the <i>Seanad</i> would save €20 million a year. This figure was analysed in the media and was quickly questioned. However, FG pressed ahead with the line throughout the campaign.
            </p>
            
            <p>Although the Labour Party officially supported abolition of the <i>Seanad</i>, many of its MPs and Senators were hostile to the proposal at worst and apathetic at best. Their campaign message implied that abolishing the upper house would be a step towards greater political equality in society with the anodyne slogan ‘One People, One Parliament’. Although <i>Sinn Féin</i> (SF) took the same position, their campaign message was more explicit with the slogan ‘Equality, not Elitism’. SF was criticised for opposing the <i>Seanad</i>, not out of a commitment to unicameralism, but merely to be on the opposite side of the debate from FF, with whom they compete for votes. Other minor left‐wing groups also opposed the retention of the <i>Seanad</i> on the grounds that it is indirectly elected and elitist.
            </p>
            
            <p>FF opposed the abolition of the <i>Seanad</i>, arguing that reform is the better option and the government would have no choice but to reform the upper house in the event that the referendum question is rejected by the people. Voters were quite undecided on the issue (see Marsh <span><a href="#epdy12053-bib-0034" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12053-bib-0034R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>; Cunningham <span><a href="#epdy12053-bib-0029" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12053-bib-0029R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>). Opinion polls fluctuated between firm and close ‘yes’ outcomes, although a close ‘no’ vote was delivered on the day. The <i>Taoiseach</i> decided not to allow the defeat of his proposal become an ongoing story by immediately announcing that he would begin the process of reforming the <i>Seanad</i>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Occurring alongside the <i>Seanad</i> referendum meant that the question on the establishment of a Court of Appeal, to sit between the High Court and Supreme Court, received relatively little attention. The necessity of a referendum arose from the heavy caseload of the Irish Supreme Court. Unlike its closest comparator, the United States Supreme Court, the Irish Supreme Court must hear all appeals from the lower High Court. In effect this means that it must consider many cases where appeals are based on administrative issues rather than substantive points of law, resulting in a four‐year wait for those litigants wishing to have their cases resolved. Some opposition from civil society groups was evident but all of the political parties supported the move. This referendum passed with a clear majority of voter support.

         <p>Though there were no elections scheduled, the ongoing economic crisis meant Irish politics were never going to be normal, but 2013 came as close to normal as they might have been. The government's primary goal in 2013 was to ensure that Ireland left the bail‐out without requiring any further financial assistance that could be characterised as a ‘second bail‐out’. This was likely, barring any shocks, and indeed happened. Yet 2013 was not without its notable political and economic events.</p>
         
         <p>The Irish economy made some improvements on leading economic indicators in 2013. While gross domestic product (GDP) growth was flat at –0.3 per cent, gross national product (GNP) increased by 3.4 per cent. Unemployment fell from from 13.8 to 12 per cent, representing an increase of 64,300 jobs in the economy. However, headline macroeconomic figures have not been accompanied by any obvious improvements in citizens' lives. Emigration continues to be a problem, particularly among the young. Many towns in Ireland have developed a generational hollow point that undermines the positive effects of the macroeconomic recovery. A potential housing crisis remained with increasing numbers in mortgage arrears. The banks refused to engage with distressed borrowers to do debt restructuring deals. Procrastination and debt deals were the only two available options as the government had effectively prohibited the state‐owned banks from carrying out repossessions of family homes.</p>
         
         <p>A first major political move came when the government moved to liquidate Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank). This was necessary in order to ease the short‐term burden of legacy bank debt on the state's finances. The government agreed a deal with the European Central Bank (ECB) to abolish a promissory note it had issued to IBRC and replace it with a long‐term bond. The promissory notes required payments of €3.06 billion per year. With the liquidation of IBRC, a new deal was agreed that stretched the payments out as far as 2053. The implication of this deal, and the easing of the burden on the state's finances, meant that the state's borrowing costs began to fall. Thus, government could look forward to a smooth exit from the bail‐out and a return to relatively normal sovereign borrowing.</p>
         
         <p>The process of liquidating IBRC required sudden legislative action early in the year. The government had secretly prepared the groundwork for liquidation, but in early February the international media picked up on speculation about it. Once the news was out, the government had to act quickly to pass the legislation liquidating IBRC to prevent investors from getting judicial injunctions blocking the plan and, in effect, the ECB debt deal. The legislation passed all stages of the parliament overnight and was signed into law by the President before the markets opened on the morning of 7 February.</p>
         
         <p>Securing the deal meant that the government would have to find €1 billion less in taxes and spending cuts than originally planned in order to meet the deficit targets set by the Troika (i.e., the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the ECB). In fact it just meant that fewer cuts were needed; there was no way for the government to spend more. The political wrangling on how this should affect the budgetary arithmetic began immediately. While some in FG wanted to press ahead with the originally planned austerity measure of €3.1 billion in tax increases and spending cuts in order to make the fiscal situation less susceptible to shocks, the Labour Party wanted to use the money to ease austerity sooner, even if that meant more austerity in future budgets. Inevitably a compromise was done and the austerity measures amounted to a €2.6 billion adjustment. The haggling between the parties over the adjustment was played out in the media past the point at which most commentators knew the deal was done.</p>
         
         <p>Abortion returned to the political agenda in 2013. The government committed to legalising the termination of a pregnancy in circumstances where the mother's life was at risk. The issue came to the fore in late 2012 when a woman died in Galway University Hospital having been refused a life‐saving termination on the grounds that it would be illegal (see O'Malley <span><a href="#epdy12053-bib-0038" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12053-bib-0038R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 107). The facts of the case are still in dispute, but pressure was applied, especially from within the governing Labour Party, to clarify the legal situation with regards to abortion. The government decided to legislate for abortion where the mother's life is at risk. Pro‐choice politicians and activists argued that the legislation should go further, to include situations where the mother's health is at risk, and pregnancy as a result of rape or incest. While the austerity budgets caused internal party problems for the leadership of Labour, legislating for abortion caused similar internal strife for FG.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the months before the legislation was brought before the <i>Dáil</i>, the initial speculation was that 20 FG MPs and Senators might vote against the legislation. Irish parliamentary procedure includes the equivalent of a three‐line whip on every vote. Without the explicit permission of the party leadership, all MPs are expected to vote as instructed. FG MPs and Senators argued that abortion is a matter of conscience and they should not be forced into voting for it.
         </p>
         
         <p>In order to calm internal dissent, the FG leadership added requirements to the legislation for multiple safeguards to make a decision about a termination – unheard of for any other medical procedure. This would make it effectively impossible to get a termination and, it was argued, most women in need of a termination would still opt to travel to the United Kingdom rather than apply for it in Ireland. The Labour Party reacted angrily to these requirements, which were, as a result, diluted somewhat in the final version of the legislation.</p>
         
         <p>When it came to whipping the votes on the issue before the summer break, the <i>Taoiseach</i> took a hard line against potential defectors, warning them that, in addition to losing the party whip, they would also be prohibited from standing as FG candidates at the next election. The usual practice is that defectors are quietly re‐admitted after a period of six months to two years out of the parliamentary party, and never is their candidature or continued membership in the wider party threatened. Ultimately, five FG MPs, including a junior minister, and two Senators voted against the legislation, immediately losing the party whip and any government‐gifted jobs in the process. Most of these individuals formed a break‐away group called the ‘Reform Alliance’ when it became clear that the <i>Taoiseach</i> would not reconsider his hard‐line stance. The primary aim of this group was to lobby the Speaker of the <i>Dáil</i> to recognise them as a parliamentary group, thus entitling them to speaking time and the right to question the <i>Taoiseach</i> and government ministers. While they were granted speaking time in debates, they had not, by the end of 2013, been allowed to directly question ministers. Opposition parties also found the issue difficult. FF allowed a free vote in part to make a virtue out of necessity, as the party was split on the issue. One SF MP voted against the legislation and lost his party's whip and the committee chair that came with the gift of the party.
         </p>
         
         <p>A Labour MP and junior minister who had been expelled from the parliamentary party for defying the whip in 2011 was re‐admitted in October 2013, though he was not reinstated as junior minister. Another Labour MP, who had been the chairman of the party but expelled in 2012 for failing to support the budget, joined FF. This was a rare example of an MP switching parties in Ireland.</p>
         
         <p>In 2013, there were indications that a new party might emerge. An interesting non‐event during the crisis was the absence of a new and successful political party (see Mair <span><a href="#epdy12053-bib-0033" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12053-bib-0033R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 288). Despite the speculation of various possible formations on the right, nothing emerged. A constitutional convention comprised of 67 citizens and 33 politicians met several times to discuss issues of political and social reform throughout 2013. The convention voted on whether to recommend to the government that Ireland have a referendum on each topic discussed. The topics covered areas from electoral and <i>Dáil</i> reform to social issues such as the symbolic role of women outlined in the constitution and same‐sex marriage. So far, the more significant outcomes of the convention have been to recommend holding a referendum on same‐sex marriage but not to change Ireland's electoral system.
         </p>
         
         <p>The media put pressure on the government to expedite the establishment of an inquiry into the financial collapse of the state. During the summer the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Ireland's biggest‐selling newspaper, publicised recordings of conversations between senior executives at Anglo Irish Bank (more recently IBRC). The content of these tapes demonstrated that the bankers had misrepresented the scale of the bank's exposure to bad loans when it sought state financial assistance. Their strategy was to present a figure that was too large to be written off but small enough for the state to support them. At that point, they predicted, any revelations of greater losses would make further assistance automatic as the state would have to protect its initial investment by not letting the bank fail.
         </p>
         
         <p>The recordings of bankers so clearly and contemptuously attempting to entice the state into supporting their institution had more shock value than evidential value. After some brief consideration, the Irish Central Bank announced that it was dropping its investigation of the tapes' content. Nonetheless, the episode did keep the pressure on the government to establish a banking inquiry, which some commentators have said is necessary to prevent similar catastrophes from recurring in the future. The difficulty is that although many MPs would like the opportunity to question bankers in public, the commitment to a time‐consuming investigation could put their parliamentary seats in jeopardy. Moreover, the government is trying to exclude parliamentarians who may have made statements in the past that indicate bias against the bankers and other political and civil service actors involved. Ultimately, this move is more about excluding non‐government MPs with considerable media profiles than a commitment to high standards of jurisprudence.</p>
