         <p>The survival of the governing coalition among New Democracy (<i>Nea Demokratia</i>, ND), Panhellenic Socialist Party (<i>Panellinio Sosialistiko Kinima</i>, PASOK) and Democratic Left (<i>Dimokratiki Aristera</i>, DIMAR) that emerged from the June 2012 election was severely challenged during 2013. The coalition fought over a range of issues from employment layoffs to immigration policy, and ND often accused DIMAR – a spin‐off from the main opposition party, the Coalition of the Radical Left (<i>Synaspismos tis Rizospastikis Aristeras</i>, SYRIZA) – of obstructing necessary public sector reforms. DIMAR eventually left the governing coalition, thus weakening the governmental majority in parliament (153 out of 300). A significant government reshuffle ensued and high‐profile PASOK cadres became more directly involved in the new cabinet. Unemployment reached new highs (28 per cent by the end of the year) and the economy remained in recession. Despite these developments, the remaining governing coalition survived and succeeded in changing perceptions about the Greek crisis abroad by drastically decreasing the deficit and generating a primary surplus for 2013. Mass protests and violent demonstrations over austerity measures subsided in 2013, but violent incidents did not abate.

         <p>The breaking point for the coalition between ND, PASOK and DIMAR came in June 2013 following the government decision to abolish the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) and fire its 2,656 employees – part of an effort to comply with obligations agreed with the Troika (i.e., the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank). DIMAR protested the measure as undemocratic. Employees, opposition parties and international observers also criticised the government for this move (EBU <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>). The Journalists' Union called a 48‐hour strike on television and radio stations to protest the government's move. SYRIZA called it a ‘coup‐like action’. Talks between the coalition partners did not resolve the disagreement. This led to DIMAR's exit<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12050-note-0011_3-controller" href="#epdy12050-note-0011_3" aria-controls="epdy12050-note-0011_3" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Link to Note">1</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12050-note-0011_3" aria-labelledby="epdy12050-note-0011_3-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>Out of the 14 MPs, 11 voted in favour of exiting the government coalition and two (Grigoris Psarianos and Vasilis Oikonomou) voted against. One MP abstained.<span class="chevronDown"></span></span> from the governing coalition, internal problems for PASOK and further weakening of the governing coalition, which was now left with 153 votes in the 300‐member parliament. With DIMAR's exit, there was a significant government reshuffle and PASOK entered the cabinet with high‐profile party cadres including its leader, Evangelos Venizelos, as a Vice President of the Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs. PASOK had four ministers in the new cabinet. ND members assumed DIMAR's posts in the Ministries of Administrative Reform and Justice.

         <p>In November, SYRIZA called for a no‐confidence vote in the government that was rejected with 153 votes out of 294 present. One PASOK MP and former Deputy Minister, Theodora Tzakri, did not vote in favour of the government and was immediately expelled from the parliamentary group. Having avoided collapse during 2013, the coalition government of ND and PASOK passed the budget on 7 December with 153 out of 296 present.</p>
         
         <p>Important developments took place within the Communist Party of Greece (<i>Kommounistiko Komma Elladas</i>, KKE) and SYRIZA. Aleka Papariga, the secretary general of KKE for 22 years, stepped down from the helm of the party in April and was succeeded by Dimitris Koutsoumbas. Alexis Tsipras officially transformed SYRIZA into a unified party at its founding congress in July and abolished the numerous factions that had formed SYRIZA in 2004. This was despite the dissent expressed by the ‘Leftist Platform’ – a tendency led by SYRIZA MP Panayiotis Lafazanis. The main impetus for this transformation was the 50‐seat bonus given to the first‐place party in national elections, which SYRIZA could not receive as a coalition – but only as a unified party.
         </p>
         
         <p>New political parties were established while public opinion remained volatile. In April, former PASOK Minister Andreas Loverdos formed a new social‐democratic party called ‘Agreement for the New Greece’. In May, Theodore Katsanevas, a PASOK MP from 1989 to 2004 and son‐in‐law of Andreas Papandreou, the founder of PASOK, established a Eurosceptic political party entitled ‘Drachmi Greek Democratic Movement Five Stars’.</p>
         
         <p>In November, 11 independent MPs who had been ousted from various parties since June 2012 formed a parliamentary group called ‘Independent Democratic Parliamentarians’. This group now enjoyed the full privileges of a parliamentary group, forming the eighth and smallest one. In December, Vyron Polydoras, a former Minister for Public Order and an ND MP for over 30 years, declared himself an independent. Together with Tzakri's exit from PASOK that took place in the same month, the number of independents rose to 14 by the end of 2013.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12050-sec-0005-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>The most dramatic reform was the abolition of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) on 11 June and its replacement by a slimmed‐down broadcaster. This was a sledgehammer way of firing personnel from the Greek public sector and satisfying the Troika's demand for 2,000 layoffs by the end of June. This decision was announced by the government spokesperson, but the governing coalition partners were not fully in the know. In fact, the government issued a ministerial decision instead of taking the reform to a parliamentary vote since such a measure would not pass. The opening of NERIT, the new broadcaster, took longer than expected and Greece's top administrative court ruled that the closure of the national broadcasting corporation had been unconstitutional. The transitional Hellenic Public Television hired 800 people a month and, ultimately, NERIT was established and hired another 600 people. In October, police units entered the premises of the now defunct ERT and evacuated the remaining squatters.</p>
         
         <p>In May, 33 per cent of OPAP (the organisation that operates lottery and sports betting games) and its management was sold to Emma Delta for <b>€</b>652 million. This was one of the controversial privatisation moves. SYRIZA accused the government of squandering the property of the Greek people. Meanwhile, the privatisation of the Greek natural gas company, DEPA, failed since there were no bidders, but Azerbaijan's state‐owned oil and gas producer, Socar, bought a 66 per cent stake in Greece's gas grid operator, DESFA, for <b>€</b>400 million. Relatedly, in the summer, it was decided that Azeri gas resources to Europe would use a pipeline running through Turkey, Greece and Albania to Italy (the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, TAP) instead of the competing routes through Central and Eastern Europe. In the banking sector, the most important development was the recapitalisation of what the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund called ‘systemic’ Greek banks (National, Eurobank, Piraeus and Alpha Bank) at a cost of <b>€</b>25 billion (Hellenic Financial Stability Fund <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The government reduced sales tax in restaurants from 23 to 13 per cent to help out the tourism sector. Another law, introduced by the Ministry of Development and Competitiveness, was the optional opening of stores on seven Sundays of the year. Unionists as well as the Church of Greece heavily opposed the measure, but consumers embraced it.</p>
         
         <p>On the thorny issue of immigration policy, Greek authorities had a much harder time controlling the sea borders, despite their success in guarding the border with Turkey. Moreover, regional instability intensified the problems faced by Greece on the immigration front. The Minister of Public Order and Citizens' Protection, Nikos Dendias, continued the ‘Hospitable Zeus’ operation, which involved rounding up suspected undocumented immigrants and holding them in detention camps before deportation (see Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 89). After a year of activity, the percentage of undocumented immigrants among those rounded up was quite low. Moreover, protests about the conditions in the so‐called ‘temporary detention camps’, which in many cases became less temporary than planned, culminated in unrest in the Amygdaleza camp in August and the escape of ten Afghan and Pakistani immigrants. By August, many of these immigrants had been there for a year even though Mr Dendias had declared that these camps would hold immigrants for no more than six months in order to ascertain whether they would be repatriated or given a residency permit. The unrest broke out when the government announced that they would have to remain there for another six months.
         </p>
         
         <p>In July, the Asylum Service – an independent organisation under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection – began operating. This new body is responsible for processing asylum applications, which was previously under the jurisdiction of the police. In the first six months, about 4,200 new applications were filed and 1,670 decisions issued granting asylum to 213 applicants.</p>

         <p>In April 2013 the coalition government passed an omnibus bill as a result of a compromise reached with the Troika to get another tranche of the bail‐out. It included 15,000 civil service layoffs by the end of 2014. The bill was heavily contested, but it passed with 168 votes in favour, 123 against and one abstention out of 292 MPs present.</p>
         
         <p>A month after the ERT shutdown in June, the Hellenic parliament – again under Troika pressure – approved new austerity measures, including plans to put 25,000 civil servants into a ‘mobility plan’. This led to tensions with those affected: primary and secondary school teachers, municipal police officers, administrative staff from universities and technical colleges, public health care workers, as well as the staff of various social security funds and the OAED manpower organisation. According to the scheme, these individuals will receive 75 per cent of their salary for eight months until they are moved to another position. If no such position is found they will be dismissed. The reaction to this measure was the most visible in higher education sector where the striking administrative staff kept universities across the country closed for months.</p>
         
         <p>Turning to the economy, unemployment reached new highs and the real economy remained in recession despite a successful tourist season. Poverty kept engulfing more and more people, with the most symbolic events being the tragic death of two college students in Larisa and a little girl in Thessaloniki. In both cases, people died because of the fumes emitted by makeshift heating devices that they were using to warm themselves since they could not afford petroleum or pay the electric bill. According to a poll toward the end of the year, 94 per cent of Greeks thought that things overall and in the economy in particular were ‘bad’ or ‘really bad’ (MRB Hellas <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Despite these developments, the remaining governing coalition (ND and PASOK) survived and managed to change perceptions of the Greek crisis abroad. The main tool of the government in this effort was the drastic decrease of the deficit and a primary surplus for 2013 – the first since 2002. This was achieved by reducing public expenditure and increasing taxation. The International Monetary Fund heavily criticised the Greek government, but also admitted that intervention should have occurred earlier and that the Fund's projections concerning the performance of the real economy were too optimistic (IMF <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Judicial proceedings of several political figures reached verdicts within 2013. For the first time since the collapse of the Junta in 1974, a minister was convicted of a crime. Former Defence Minister, Akis Tsochatzopoulos, was found guilty of receiving bribes for the purchase of submarines and money laundering and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. A total of 15 more people were also convicted as accomplices. A council of judges ruled that former Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou should face a special court (the first minister to experience such a trial since 1989) for removing the names of three relatives from the ‘Lagarde list’.<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12050-note-0012_21-controller" href="#epdy12050-note-0012_21" aria-controls="epdy12050-note-0012_21" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Link to Note">2</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12050-note-0012_21" aria-labelledby="epdy12050-note-0012_21-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>A list of some 2,000 Greeks who held accounts at the Geneva branch of HSBC bank that possibly included tax evaders.<span class="chevronDown"></span></span> Finally, former mayor of Thessaloniki, Vassilis Papageorgopoulos, and his chief municipal secretary were both sentenced to life imprisonment for embezzlement of millions of euros from the municipality's coffers (Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 89). The public's trust levels toward political parties, government and parliament plummeted to 4, 9 and 10 per cent, respectively (European Commission <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Although mass protests and demonstrations over austerity measures subsided in 2013, violent incidents did not abate. Immigrants remained in the news both as victims of racist attacks and as an issue that divided public opinion. In 2013 over a hundred incidents of racist violence occurred, involving about 320 individuals, most of whom were immigrants or refugees (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>). These figures skyrocketed in 2013, primarily as a result of a shooting in Nea Manolada, where a strawberry producer employing over 150 immigrants from Bangladesh was refusing to pay them. When the employees went on strike and demanded their pay, three foremen began shooting at them, wounding 35 and creating a public uproar.

         <p>‘Nuclei of Fire’, a radical anarchist group that first surfaced in 2008, placed two homemade bombs on the first floor of a shopping centre in Athens on 20 January. Two private security guards were injured by the explosion. In February, 40 hooded assailants attacked Hellas Gold mining site in northern Greece, doused the security guards on duty with petrol and then went on to destroy about a dozen company vehicles and equipment. Many local community members argue that the mine will destroy the local forest and irreversibly damage the ecosystem. Another group of locals are focusing on the jobs that will be created through these mining activities. The police detained 33 people including a local SYRIZA party cadre. SYRIZA accused the government of attempting to stigmatise social struggle. The government accused SYRIZA of supporting, if not instigating, social unrest and jeopardising crucial international investments. In April, things heated up again when the police arrested two more people for their alleged involvement in the February attack. A large group of locals subsequently raided the local police precinct and torched computers and furniture. Police officers had to evacuate the precinct. This incident once again inflamed the spat between the government and SYRIZA. The government accused SYRIZA of instigating these violent incidents; SYRIZA accused the government of using despotic tactics and violating human rights.</p>
         
         <p>Political violence continued and turned deadly by the autumn months. In September, Golden Dawn's (<i>Chrysi Avgi</i>, XA) violent behaviour against immigrants and left‐wing groups culminated in the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, a left‐wing anti‐fascist hip‐hop artist, by one of its party cadres, Giorgos Roupakias. The High Court of Greece described this incident as a coordinated hit implicating the whole hierarchy of XA – the party that surprised everyone with its meteoric electoral rise in the 2012 elections (Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 92). The leadership and some followers of XA were now under investigation for having formed ‘a criminal organisation’. Its political leader was imprisoned along with several others of its MPs and followers. The remaining parliamentary political parties voted to lift the immunity of several XA MPs, and a large majority of MPs voted to freeze the party's state funding.
         </p>
         
         <p>In November, XA members Manolis Kapelonis and Giorgos Fountoulis were murdered and Alexandros Gerontas was severely injured by a new terrorist organisation called ‘Militant Popular Revolutionary Forces’. They argued that these were political executions in retribution for the killing of Pavlos Fyssas and ‘the starting point of a popular campaign to send the neo‐Nazi scum of Golden Dawn where they belong, to the trash can of history’ (Katsonis 2013). These killings set off a debate over the role of violence in politics and whether any violence apart from state violence can be seen as legitimate. These developments led to the resurfacing of the ‘theory of two extremes’, which equates left‐wing extremism with right‐wing violence (Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-9010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-9010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>: 440). Since 2010, the country has been divided along a <i>memorandum/anti‐memorandum</i> cleavage, with the former camp seeing the measures stipulated in the various loan agreements signed with the Troika as the way out of this crisis and the latter camp opposing the reforms and austerity measures and suggesting that Greece's debt is illegitimate and cannot realistically be repaid (Mavrogordatos &amp; Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12050-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12050-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 986). ND attempted to increase the salience of another cleavage, that of <i>law and order</i> versus <i>non‐state violence</i>. The premise behind the ‘theory of the two extremes’ was that parts of SYRIZA and the XA are equally prone to justifying the use of violence in politics while the rest of the parties in Greece have no hesitation in condemning such practices. SYRIZA was especially sensitive to this theory since its proponents put it in the same category as the XA. This theory had many supporters, but failed to displace the <i>memorandum/anti‐memorandum</i> cleavage.
