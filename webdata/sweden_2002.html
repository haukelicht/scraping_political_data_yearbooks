<section class="article-section article-section__full"><section class="article-section__content" id="s1-1-ps"><p>The year 2003 was one of the most dramatic in modern Swedish political history. Membership of the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was rejected in a referendum held in September. The vote was preceded by an unusually heated campaign, which came to a premature halt four days before the referendum when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Anna Lindh, was assassinated. The ‘No’ majority against the euro was clear, which suggested a widening gap between the political elite and ordinary citizens. The Social Democratic minority government, led by Göran Persson, stayed in office throughout the year, due to parliamentary support from the Left and Green parties.</p>

         <p>The European Monetary Union (EMU) became something of a hot potato for the Government soon after Sweden entered the European Union (EU) in January 1995. Legalistically speaking, the Swedish position was not entirely clear. The EU accession agreement included no formal exemption from the parts of the Treaty of Maastricht dealing with the single currency. In connection with the entry agreement, however, the then Minister for European affairs, Ulf Dinkelspiel, made a verbal declaration that Sweden reserved the right to subject entry into the third stage of the EMU to a separate decision. In 1996, a Commission of Inquiry recommended a ‘wait and see’ strategy in the so‐called ‘Calmfors Report’. This was adopted as official government policy in 1997, which meant that Sweden did not introduce the euro at the time of its initial launch in January 2002. Still, the issue was never off the agenda. Prime Minister Göran Persson would have preferred to avoid a referendum, with opinion polls indicating public scepticism. However, at an extraordinary party congress in March 2000, the Social Democratic leadership was forced into granting a referendum in order to secure an EMU‐positive congress resolution. In late November 2002, the parliamentary parties agreed to hold the referendum on Sunday, 14 September 2003.<a href="#t1%20#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The Moderate, Liberal, Social Democratic and Christian Democratic parties were officially pro‐euro, while the Centre, Left and Green parties were on the ‘No’ side. However, hardly any of the parties was completely united. Even the Social Democratic Government itself was split, with five of the 22 ministers at some point having expressed varying degrees of euroscepticism. In response, Prime Minister Persson demanded that ministers, as well as their staff, toe the party line or resign. The ultimatum was largely respected, which may have prevented too much internal conflict during the campaign, but also led to an unwelcome debate about Persson's authoritarian leadership style.</p>
         
         <p>The main business organisation, the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, was firmly pro‐EMU. The situation among trade unions was less clear‐cut, with several unions declaring themselves as officially neutral. This included the blue‐collar union confederation LO, which demanded the creation of ‘buffer funds’ to support the euro. These funds would be used to stimulate the Swedish economy in a recession to compensate for the loss of an independent Swedish interest rate. The Government was sceptical, fearing an unwelcome debate about ‘fund socialism’, along the lines of the ill fated ‘wage earner funds’ from the 1980s. After unsuccessful meetings between the Government and LO, the latter decided on a neutral position in April. In the summer, when polls indicated a clear ‘No’ lead, which showed no signs of narrowing, talks were resumed.</p>
         
         <p>In mid‐August, a joint declaration was made in which six fiscal policy principles were outlined in the event of the euro being introduced. These included the creation of a larger fiscal ‘buffer’, although there was no explicit mention of funds. LO's official position was unchanged, but the LO chair, Vanja Lundby Wedin, argued that the euro would have positive effects on employment, wages and democracy. She repeated these views in a newspaper article on 1 September in the daily broadsheet <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>. The article was also signed by the heads of the white‐collar union confederations SACO and TCO, as well as by heads of employers associations in the private and public sectors. The ‘No’ campaign argued that the article represented elite collusion in favour of the euro, and Lundby Wedin was criticised for the imbalance between her pro‐euro statements and the neutral position of her organisation.
         </p>
         
         <p>By Swedish standards, the campaign was heated. Radio and television discussions were often confrontational, and both sides were criticised for exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims. The campaign centred on two main themes: economy and influence. On the former theme, the ‘Yes’ side claimed that the euro would have positive effects for business and employment. A related argument was that the Swedish currency is too small and weak to resist speculation. The ‘No’ side argued that there is no clear relationship between economic performance and membership in the eurozone, and that non‐euro economies had done at least as well the euro countries since the euro was introduced. On the influence/democracy theme, the ‘Yes’ side used the slogan ‘Should we be part or stay outside?’, arguing that it is in Sweden's interest to be part of the European integration process. The ‘No’ side criticised the European Central Bank (ECB) for a lack of openness and democratic accountability, and claimed that the ECB will not take the interests of small member states into account.</p>
         
         <p>This brief summary does not do justice to the many arguments in the campaign. It can be noted, however, that there was no clear left‐right divide. The ‘No’ campaign included the Centre Party as well as several individuals from other non‐socialist parties and the business community. The ‘Yes’ campaign included many Social Democrats as well as some individuals from the more radical left. Some ‘No’ campaigners portrayed the euro as a threat to the welfare state, while others claimed that it would be damaging for business. Conversely, there were ‘Yes’ campaigners who argued that the euro is the best way to ensure the future of the welfare state, while others claimed that it would create better conditions for business. A recurring theme on the ‘No’ side was the ‘wait and see’ argument, which pointed out that a decision to join the euro is irreversible, while a decision to stay outside can be reconsidered later.</p>
         
         <p>Into the final week there was a clear ‘No’ lead, although the ‘Yes’ campaign was expected to throw everything into the last few days. On 10 September, however, Anna Lindh, Minister for Foreign Affairs and one of the leading ‘Yes’ campaigners, was attacked by a knifeman in a Stockholm department store. She died the following morning. A 24 year‐old man was arrested two weeks after the attack. No explicit political motive has been reported. All campaigning was stopped after the assassination. Both sides agreed to refrain from attacks and criticism, and only supply voters with factual information. There was some discussion of the possible effects of the assassination on the referendum, but there was widespread agreement that the vote should go ahead as planned. In the event, the clear ‘No’ victory removed all doubts about the legitimacy of the result.</p>
         
         <p>The size of the ‘No’ majority was something of a shock to the political and organisational establishment, whose majority had invested heavily in a ‘Yes’ victory. Despite a substantial advantage in campaign resources, the ‘Yes’ side had failed to persuade the electorate, and many saw the result as evidence of a widening gap between ordinary citizens and the elite. The fact that the Government and the main opposition parties campaigned on the ‘Yes’ side, and joint initiatives such as the above‐mentioned newspaper article signed by unions and employers, may have given the impression of elite collusion to convince the voters into a ‘Yes’ vote. At least as important was the fact that the ‘No’ campaign was broad enough to avoid any extremist tag, which enabled it to make inroads among supporters of the pro‐EMU parties on the centre‐right. In addition, the Christian Democratic and Social Democratic leaderships failed to convince the majority of their supporters to vote ‘Yes’. It also appears that the ‘wait and see’ argument, which conveyed the message that a ‘No’ vote did not have to be an anti‐EU act, was effective. The social and demographic distribution of ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ votes had similarities with the 1994 referendum on EU accession, with the obvious difference that the ‘No’ vote in all groups was higher in 2003. Thus, northern and rural parts of the country, women, public sector employees and the working class voted ‘No’ to a disproportionate extent. The result will have delayed introduction of the euro by at least a decade. Shortly before the vote, Prime Minister Persson and the other pro‐euro party leaders declared that, in the event of a ‘No’ victory, Sweden can introduce the euro in 2013 at the earliest.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>There were no major cabinet changes in 2003, but a minor reshuffle took place a few weeks after the referendum. Deputy Prime Minister Margareta Winberg was effectively sacked and became ambassador to Brazil. This may to some extent have been punishment for Winberg's anti‐euro stance, but other factors such as the overall cabinet balance in terms of age and gender may also have played a part. It is worth noting that Leif Pagrotsky, Minister for Industry and Commerce, who had been at least as outspoken against the euro, somewhat surprisingly was kept. The other post‐referendum casualty was Jan O. Karlsson, Minister for Migration and Foreign Aid. Karlsson was not an EMU critic, but had been involved in a number of scandals, and made a series of ill‐judged statements (e.g., referring to President Bush as ‘that damn Texas chap’) since he joined the cabinet in January 2002, and his departure was predicted. Completely unexpected, however, was the appointment of Laila Freivalds to succeed Anna Lindh as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Freivalds had served as Minister of Justice in Social Democratic governments in the 1980s and 1990s, but resigned in 2000 following revelations about property dealings (see the entry on Sweden in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>). Freivalds is regarded as competent and dependable, but is expected to keep a lower profile than her predecessor on international conflict areas such as Iraq and the Middle East. The other two newcomers were unknown to the public. Barbro Holmberg was handed responsibility for migration, while Carin Jämtin took charge of foreign aid. Both were placed in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Winberg's post as deputy Prime Minister was abolished. The total number of ministers was 22, the same as before Lindh's death. With one of the departures being a man, and all three newcomers women, the gender balance was adjusted upwards to exactly 50 per cent. The average age stayed marginally above 48 years.

         <p>Gudrun Schyman, leader of the Left Party, was forced to resign in January, following news reports about her tax self‐assessment, in which she had made a number of unsubstantiated deduction claims. Schyman was apologetic, but denied any fraudulent intentions, blaming a heavy workload and bad organisation. However, the revelations were very damaging in a party that argues for heavy taxes on high incomes, and also suggested a lifestyle different from the party's core supporters in low‐income public‐sector occupations. Schyman was forced to resign by internal pressure. Instead of a permanent successor, a temporary leadership was installed, consisting of Ulla Hoffmann and Ingrid Burman. The former became <i>de facto</i> leader, although Schyman's post as the formal party chair remained vacant until the next party congress, due to be held in February 2004. Schyman had led the party since 1993. She is charismatic, and her personal popularity has exceeded that of her party. Against much internal opposition, she worked to rid the party of its Marxist baggage, and manoeuvred it into a position of unprecedented political legitimacy and influence. There were speculations that her departure would trigger an orthodox backlash, with left‐winger Lars Ohly emerging towards the end of the year as favourite for the permanent leadership.
         </p>
         
         <p>The growth rate of the Swedish economy slowed down compared to 2002. According to a report published in March 2004 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER), GDP grew by 1.6 per cent in 2003. This was 0.5 percentage points lower than in 2002, but the NIER projected an increase to 2.5 per cent for 2004. In response to the slow‐down and international economic uncertainty, the Government announced in February 2003 that election promises from 2002 on increased parental and sickness benefits would have to be postponed. The cautious approach was evident also in the main budget, which was presented to Parliament on 22 September. The budget projected a fiscal deficit of 1.8 per cent of GDP for 2003. The deficit was projected to decrease only marginally in 2004, but the Government remained confident that it would be able to maintain its overall target of a 2 per cent public finance surplus over the economic cycle. The national debt was projected to grow in absolute terms to just above SEK1,200 billion (c130 billion) in 2004, but would decline relative to GDP, from 48.8 per cent in 2003 to 48.5 per cent in 2004 (the figures are not comparable to earlier years due to a re‐definition of national debt by the Swedish National Debt Office, effective from 2003).</p>
         
         <p>The employment situation was somewhat worrying. According to statistics from the Swedish National Labour Market Administration, the annual average unemployment for 2003 was 5.0 per cent of the workforce, compared to 4.2 in 2002. A further 2.1 per cent were involved in labour market schemes, which meant a total unemployment rate of 7.1 per cent, an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2002. Inflation declined slightly, and largely stayed within the central bank <i>Riksbanken</i>'s target of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ± 1 percentage point. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12 month changes in Consumer Price Index) was over 3 per cent in early 2003, but went down to 1.4 per cent at the end of the year. The overall change in Consumer Price Index between 2002 and 2003 was +2.1 per cent.
