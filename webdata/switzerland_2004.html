         <p>There were no changes in the personnel or the party composition of the Swiss Cabinet in 2005. Samuel Schmid (1947 male, SVP) was elected President of the Swiss Federation. He also presides over the Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports (VBS).</p>

         <p>There were no major changes in the membership of the parliament in 2005. Jean‐Philippe Maitre (CVP, canton of Geneva) presided over the lower house (<i>Nationalrat</i>) until 18 February 2005 when he decided to resign because of health concerns. He was succeeded by Thérèse Meyer (CVP, canton of Fribourg). The president of the upper house (<i>Ständerat</i>) was Bruno Frick (CVP, canton of Schwyz).

         <p>The year 2005 was a ‘European referendum year’. It started in June when the Swiss people had to decide on Switzerland's membership of the Schengen/Dublin Agreement. The Schengen Treaty, which is part of the second bilateral negotiations between Switzerland and the European Union (EU), and which was approved by the National Council and the Council of States early in 2005, regulates cross‐border cooperation between the Schengen signatory states. Its aim is to facilitate free tourist traffic by doing away with border controls on individuals. Moreover, the Schengen information system enables the participating states to combat international crime more efficiently. By signing the first asylum accord of Dublin Switzerland would get access to Eurodac – a digital fingerprint database that facilitates the identification of rejected asylum seekers.</p>
         
         <p>The eurosceptical Swiss People's Party (SVP) and the Campaign for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland (AUNS) launched a referendum against the agreement. Their opposition was primarily directed at the abolition of border controls: it would make Switzerland more unsafe, so they argued. In addition, the opponents feared that signing the Schengen/Dublin Agreement would start an integration process over whose further development the people would have no say. The supporters in turn pointed mainly at the benefit for tourism that Schengen would bring and argued that the Schengen and Eurodac databases would enhance, and not reduce, security. The supporters were backed by large parts of the economy and a majority of the political parties. Despite the dominance of the supporters in the parliamentary arena, the outcome in the referendum arena was uncertain. In the past, the resourceful SVP has managed more than once to win a referendum in which they alone were against a proposal.</p>
         
         <p>As a consequence, the positive outcome of the ballot was met with great relief on the side of the supporters. In contrast to earlier referenda on Europe, the two centre parties (<i>Mitte‐Parteien</i>) – the Christian Democrats (CVP) and the Radical Free Democrats (FDP) – were successful in urging their supporters to vote ‘Yes’. Their followers overwhelmingly supported the proposal (72 per cent of the CVP followers and 79 per cent of the FDP followers said ‘Yes’ to Schengen/Dublin). Support was even higher among the left (over 80 per cent); however, the left has always been pro‐European. Another reason for the remarkably high overall acceptance for Schengen/Dublin (54.6 per cent) was the fact that a marginal majority of the non‐partisans (52 per cent) followed the Federal Council's recommendations (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Engeli &amp; Tresch 2005</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>On the same day, the Swiss people gave a clear thumbs‐up (by 58 per cent) to the registration of same‐sex partnerships. The new law set aside a form of registered partnership in order to put gay and lesbian couples on an equal footing with married heterosexual couples concerning the law on inheritance, social security and tax as well as occupational pension plans. Also, upon five years residence, foreign partners would be allowed to apply for Swiss citizenship, subject to the condition that the partnership had been registered at least three years before. However, homosexual couples are still refused permission to adopt children or to undergo reproductive procedures (e.g., in‐vitro fertilisation). The ballot was not nearly as closely contested as the one over the Schengen/Dublin Agreement, mainly because the opponents of the bill – again the SVP and some small right‐wing parties – focused on Schengen/Dublin, which they considered to be the more important task and for which the lion's share of the campaign money was spent. As a consequence, the media campaign was not very lively and practically invisible. Therefore, the voters were badly informed: more than half of them were not able to tell the pollsters what motivated their decision (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Engeli &amp; Tresch 2005</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The ‘European referendum year’ entered its second and decisive stage in late September when the Swiss voters were asked to decide over the extension of the free movement of persons – part of the Bilateral Accords I – to the ten new EU Member States. The reason why the people had the final say about it was a successfully launched referendum by a small right‐wing party – the Swiss Democrats. Here again, they were supported by the SVP. However, for the first time in many years, the SVP did not stand unified against what they saw as a further step towards membership in the EU. Some of their representatives, mainly businessmen working in an export‐oriented market segment, but first and foremost their most famous representative, <i>Bundesrat</i> member Christoph Blocher, supported the proposal. They agreed with the Federal Council and a clear majority of parliament that the Swiss economy needs access to the new emerging markets in the former Eastern bloc and in southern Europe. Furthermore, they argued that the Swiss economy is dependent on foreign labour, also from the new EU Member States. And last but not least, expanding the free movement of persons agreement to the new EU Member States would be a logical step within the ‘bilateral path’– a path that not least the <i>opponents</i> of the proposal at stake had chosen to go when they refused to join the EEA back in 1992. In a nutshell, the referendum was also a vote on the government's policy on Europe.
         </p>
         
         <p>The opponents in turn knew about the public's concerns about the influx of cheap labour and hence focused in their campaign on the possible labour‐market consequences of accepting the free movement of persons agreement: wage dumping, the undermining of collective employment agreements, rising unemployment and increasing strains on the welfare system. To counter these arguments, the government negotiated with the EU a seven‐year transition period during which Switzerland can narrow the number of workers from the new Member States through quotas. Additionally, the accompanying measures that were introduced together with the free movements of persons agreement with the ‘old’ Members States of the EU and which served to prevent cheaper labour from the EU were tightened by the parliament. These measures (among others: a minimum wage guarantee) were introduced to ensure support from the left.</p>
         
         <p>The ballot followed a hotly discussed and controversial campaign. Additional excitement was provoked by a statement of the EU's Foreign Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero‐Waldner who threatened that the EU would not sign the Schengen/Dublin Agreement – which the Swiss people had accepted in a referendum three months before – if Switzerland would not approve the free movement of persons agreement. The proposal's opponents took this statement up and called on the electorate not to surrender to this alleged ‘blackmail’. And indeed, surveys showed a remarkable, but short‐lived, decrease in acceptance for the free movement of persons agreement after this statement. However, it was not quite clear how the EU would react to a rejection of the proposal since other leading figures of the EU stressed that there is no legal relation between the Bilateral I and II agreements. However, the <i>first</i> Bilateral Accords would have been placed dangerously at risk with the refusal of the free movement of persons extension since the two are legally related with each other. Therefore, the stakes were high: in the worst case scenario the whole bilateral package could have been revoked by the EU (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Kopp &amp; Milic 2005</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The people's vote was met with great relief by the Federal Council and the great majority of parliament: the proposal was given clear backing by 56 per cent of the voters. Thus, the free movement of persons agreement found even more acceptance than the proposal on Schengen and Dublin. The post‐vote VOX analysis revealed that a majority of the Swiss voters are in favour of the bilateral path and consequently rebuffed what would have meant <i>further isolation</i> from Europe (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Kopp &amp; Milic 2005</a></span>). Furthermore, the analysis confirmed a trend already observed on previous occasions involving decisions about European policy issues. The so‐called ‘Röschti trench’ (which divides French‐ and German‐speaking Switzerland), usually yawning deep and wide at referenda about Europe, gets narrower; the differences in voting behaviour on European policy issues between the two main language regions are getting smaller. Here again, the party supporters followed their parties’ recommendation and contributed in that way to the pronounced outcome of the vote.
         </p>
         
         <p>The November 2005 ballot asked one constitutional and one legislative question. The turnout was the year's lowest at 42.3 per cent, but was only slightly below average. One reason for the below‐average turnout may have been the complexity of one of the proposals (the initiative for ‘food from non‐genetically modified farming’). Only a minority knew exactly what the initiative called for: not a general ban on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the farming sector (as a majority of voters thought), but a five‐year moratorium on the import and cultivation of GMOs (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2006</a></span>). The temporary ban would not cover research within the field of GMOs. However, the opponents of the initiative feared that a ‘Yes’ to the moratorium would endanger Switzerland's leading position in that particular field of research and production. Moreover, they argued that the strict permit procedure introduced by the parliament in 2004 would satisfy most of the initiative committee's concerns.
         </p>
         
         <p>Although all the major parties with the exception of the Social Democrats supported the government's position, a majority of the voters (55.7 per cent) did not follow their recommendations and instead voted <i>in favour</i> of the initiative. The initiative for ‘food from non‐genetically modified farming’ was only the fifteenth initiative (out of 160!) to be adopted by the people and only the second one to be approved by <i>all</i> of the cantons. Moreover, the result could have been even more devastating for Berne, if all the voters had voted correctly. The post‐ballot VOX analysis showed that 13 per cent of the ‘No’ voters in fact were <i>against</i> genetically modified food (and therefore should have had to cast a ‘Yes’ vote) but confused their decision (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2006</a></span>). The prime reason for the refusal of GMOs was not a general fear of gene technology, but the argument that there are still too many risks concerning this issue.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second proposal on which the Swiss voters had to decide on 27 November aimed at giving permission to shops in public transport centres to remain open on Sundays and official holidays. For years this rule was already in practice, but a federal court ruling demanded a revision of the existing law. Sunday trading was opposed by the trade unions and the left parties, while the government and the main right parties supported the change. Although the recommendations of the parties would have suggested that the stage was set for a left‐right conflict, it was not ideological antagonism that decided the outcome, but rather the level of concern and religious values. The urban centres were strongly in favour of the proposal, while the rural regions, in which there is less need for Sunday trading at major railway stations, rejected the amendment. On the individual level, the VOX analysis revealed a strong relationship between the strength of religious feelings and the vote outcome: the more often one goes to church on Sundays the more one is against Sunday trading (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hirter &amp; Linder 2006</a></span>). Unexpectedly (surveys predicted a clear ‘Yes’), the voters were only barely (50.1 per cent) in favour of the amendment.
