         <p>The year 2009 was dominated by arguments about the economy and climate change. The essential difference between the two issues is that the economic policies of the Rudd Government were generally lauded by the commentariat. By contrast debate over climate change legislation would consume the whole of 2009, at the end of which eleven cognate bills on the subject (including the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) Bill 2009, the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2009 and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Amendment [Household Assistance] Bill 2009) would be rejected by the Senate.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Climate change</h2>
         
         <p>The only way to understand debate over the climate change legislation is to know something about the Australian Liberal Party and to understand the Australian Constitution. Since the Australian Senate is popularly elected, it enjoys more power and prestige than many upper houses around the world. Knowing the power of their Senate our founding fathers, late in the nineteenth century, decided on a method to resolve deadlocks between the two houses. So they inserted into the Constitution section 57 which reads as follows:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>If the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the House of Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes the proposed law with or without any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor‐General may dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously. But such dissolution shall not take place within six months before the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by effluxion of time.</p>
<p>If after such dissolution the House of Representatives again passes the proposed law . . . and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor‐General may convene a joint sitting of the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The members present at the joint sitting may deliberate and shall vote together upon the proposed law as last proposed by the House of Representatives . . . and if the proposed law is affirmed by an absolute majority of the total number of members of the Senate and House of Representatives, it shall be taken to have been duly passed by both Houses of the Parliament, and shall be presented to the Governor‐General for the Queen's assent.</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>
            
         
         
         <p>The Australian Liberal Party differs from many European conservative parties in that, effectively, it is controlled (like its coalition partner, the rural‐based National Party) by politicians who deny that humankind is in any way to blame for the problem of global warming, if indeed there really is a problem.</p>
         
         <p>The Howard Government – a coalition of these two parties – was defeated in November 2007 at least partly because of its attitude towards climate change and notwithstanding Howard's own ‘deathbed conversion’ to a position he called ‘climate change realism’, his consequent commitment to a domestic emissions trading scheme and an aspiration to reduce carbon emissions. On 3 June 2007 he made a statement including these, which meant that, nominally, both the government and the opposition of the day went to the 2007 election with substantially the same policy. The only real difference was that Labor's policy carried credibility because they had campaigned on climate change for several years previously, while Howard's sudden switch was thought to owe much to the persuasive powers of his then Minister for the Environment, Malcolm Turnbull – the man later elected as leader of the Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition.</p>
         
         <p>It was Turnball's task to manage the conservative response to the legislation presented by the Rudd Government to Parliament. Turnbull did not want to contest an election in an atmosphere of argument about climate change. If such were the election issue, it would show up the divisions on his side of politics. He, and a substantial minority of Liberals, would be seen as being on the left and agreeing with Labor, while the rest of his party and the whole of the National Party would be seen as climate change deniers. The tension between these two views was solved in the short term by the Coalition agreeing that it would oppose the legislation on the first round. Because other non‐Labor Senators also opposed it (the Greens, for example, because it did not go far enough), this would guarantee its defeat in the Senate by 44 votes to 32 in the first half of the year. That is exactly what happened.</p>
         
         <p>In August the eleven cognate bills to implement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme were re‐introduced and again passed by the House of Representatives due to the Labor majority there. The problem arose for the Coalition as to what to do next. Turnbull was able to persuade his party that they should negotiate amendments with Labor. Consequently, the first two weeks of November saw the Climate Change Minister, Senator Penny Wong, negotiate with her Liberal Party counterpart, Mr Ian Macfarlane, a number of amendments designed to protect jobs in trade‐exposed industries. However, when that package was presented to the joint Coalition party room (i.e., the meeting of Liberal and National MPs) there was tremendous trouble. All the Nationals and a substantial number of Liberals objected to the package – even with the proposed amendments. When Turnbull tried to assert that the Coalition would support passage of the legislation through the Senate, there was more trouble and eventually a successful challenge to his leadership by Tony Abbott, who then declared that the Coalition would vote against the legislation in the Senate. On 3 December, the legislation was duly rejected by 42 votes to 34, with two Liberal Senators crossing the floor and voting with Labor.</p>
         
         <p>This meant that the Rudd Government gained what are known as ‘triggers’ for a double dissolution election in 2010. Since then, debate has continued among analysts as to whether the 2010 election will follow a double dissolution or whether it will be a normal general election for the House of Representatives accompanied by the normal half‐Senate election. Rudd, meanwhile, is keeping his options open. To risk making his CPRS the major issue of the election, which is generally expected to be held in the second half of 2010, would require some courage since he would face a charge from Tony Abbott and the Coalition that a vote for Labor would be a vote for a new tax. If he does risk it, it will be only the eighth Senate general election to have occurred (the others were in 1901, 1914, 1951, 1974, 1975, 1983 and 1987). It may produce, say, two more Labor Senators and two more Greens – a total of 41 (34 + 7) in a Senate of 76.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> The economy</h2>
         
         <p>The year began with much gloom about whether Australia could avoid a recession. It ended with general congratulations that Australia had, indeed, avoided the recession that so many other countries had experienced as a result of the global financial crisis. It became almost universal commentary to assert that Australia was the only Westernised country to escape the recession. The word ‘recession’ in Australia is defined as two successive quarters of negative economic growth. As events turned out there was one such quarter, but it was not followed by another.</p>
         
         <p>The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, received most of the credit for this feat. By September the standard interest rate was only 3 per cent compared to 7 per cent a year earlier. Such a reduction provided a massive stimulus to the economy. However, in October there was a rise of 0.25 percentage points, and Australia became the first major economy to lift rates since the financial crisis set in.</p>
         
         <p>In February the Rudd Government announced its own AUS$42 billion stimulus package. Unlike the October 2008 package of AUS$10.4 billion, this one was opposed by the Opposition and there was some doubt as to whether it would pass the Senate. (In the end it did pass the Senate when only the official Opposition voted against it.) The jobless figures announced in December were remarkably good for the Rudd Government. Some 100,000 new jobs had been created in the previous three months – most of them full time – pushing the unemployment rate well below 6 per cent. Australia's new unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent contrasted with that of New Zealand at 6.5 per cent, the United Kingdom at 7.8 per cent, the United States at 10 per cent and Spain at 19.3 per cent.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> Afghanistan</h2>
         
         <p>During 2009 four Australian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan, bringing to 12 the total number of Australian losses. In January, it was announced that for the first time in forty years a Victoria Cross was awarded (to Trooper Mark Donaldson) for ‘exceptional bravery’ in service in Afghanistan. An opinion poll published in <i>The Australian</i> on 24 March indicated a shrinking of voter support for the war. It recorded that nearly two‐thirds of Australian voters opposed sending more troops to Afghanistan. These figures were a reverse of what they had been in September 2001, when the question of ‘sending troops to Afghanistan’ yielded 66 per cent in favour and 27 per cent against. By 2009 it was 65 per cent against increasing the number from the present 1,100, and 28 per cent in favour.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss6"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss6-title"> Repeal of Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005</h2>
         
         <p>It was my view throughout the whole of 2007 that the reason Howard was headed for defeat was his insistence that Parliament pass the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005. In December 2007, the (Labor) Shadow Cabinet declared Work Choices dead, and in 2008 the Labor Party had a field day dismantling it. This was done in two stages, with the first passed in April. The second piece of legislation, the Fair Work Bill, was lying on the table at year's end. In 2009 this second piece of legislation was finally passed, although it required concessions to Senator Steve Fielding (the sole federal politician from a party known as Family First) who insisted on small business being granted exemptions from its provisions against unfair dismissal.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss7"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss7-title"> Asylum seeker boats</h2>
         
         <p>Back in the days of the Howard Government the toughest policies were developed to deter refugees from arriving on Australia's shores by boat. These various policies, though vile from a humanitarian point of view, were nevertheless successful in stopping the arrival of self‐selected refugees. Howard and his ministers would damn them as ‘queue jumpers’, ‘illegal immigrants’ and so on, thereby ensuring that these refugees would know they were not welcome. Under the Labor Government, however, some of the nastier Howard‐era features were repealed. The Coalition predicted that the boats would start coming again. And they were right. However, there is no agreement as to why they were right. Was it because Australia had developed the reputation of being a ‘soft touch’ under Labor, in effect inviting boat people to come by treating them decently on arrival? Or was it because Sri Lanka (where the great majority of recent asylum seekers come from) had changed so much after the defeat of the Tamil Tigers?</p>
         
         <p>Some forty boats arrived in 2009. In accordance with official policy, their occupants were shepherded onto Christmas Island and some 1,200 asylum seekers are now located there, awaiting processing. In the meantime, three incidents occurred which lent credibility to the Coalition claim that only a government of their persuasion could be relied on to stop the boats from coming. The first occurred in April when a small wooden boat carrying 47 asylum seekers exploded and killed five passengers in addition to injuring many others. The Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett (the only head of government in the country from the Liberal Party), claimed the incident was an act of sabotage by the asylum seekers themselves. While the Royal Australian Navy emerged from the incident with credit, the Labor Government was subjected to intense criticism from every politician in the country not of Labor persuasion. As usual, the Greens complained of Labor being too tough while the Liberals claimed it was too soft.</p>
         
         <p>If, on that occasion, criticism of Rudd was unfair, the same cannot be said of the next incident. A boat carrying 78 Sri Lankan asylum seekers sank in Indonesian waters and the passengers were rescued by the Australian Customs vessel, the <i>Oceanic Viking</i>. However, when it arrived on Indonesian shores, the asylum seekers refused to get off. They did not want to live in Indonesia: They wanted to be accepted by Australia as refugees. In the end, after a delay of two months, Rudd offered them a special deal in October (which he denied was a special deal) whereby they were all accepted to be refugees and re‐settled, some by Canada, some by Australia and some by New Zealand. The <i>Oceanic Viking</i> then resumed its normal duties. Had he still been in office John Howard would immediately have sent in the military, forced them off the boat, and the asylum seekers would have spent the rest of their lives languishing in Indonesia.
         </p>
         
         <p>The third incident occurred early in November when 12 asylum seekers were drowned after their vessel capsized in heavy seas as they sailed directly from Sri Lanka. What that incident told us (if we did not already know) was the terror these Sri Lankan Tamil refugees have at the prospect of finding themselves stuck in Indonesia – a country that is not a signatory to the International Convention on Refugees and where refugees en route to Australia are usually very badly treated.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss8"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss8-title"> Liberal Party leadership contests and other changes</h2>
         
         <p>The climate change argument produced no less than three votes on the leadership towards the end of 2009. The two that really mattered took place on Tuesday, 1 December. On the first ballot the votes were 35 for Tony Abbott, 26 for Malcolm Turnbull and 23 for Joe Hockey. On the second round the votes were 42 for Abbott and 41 for Turnbull, with one informal vote. The 84‐member party room reflected the fact that Brendan Nelson (the man whom Turnball had replaced as Liberal leader) and Peter Costello (who had long been tipped for leader but had decided not to run) had resigned their seats and by‐elections were pending (see below). Like Nelson and Turnbull, Abbott represents wealthy parts of the Sydney metropolitan area. Julie Bishop continues as deputy.</p>
         
         <p>At the end of 2009, the leadership of Labor (Kevin Rudd), the Nationals (Warren Truss) and the Greens (Senator Bob Brown) was identical to what it had been at year's beginning. Indeed, these three parties enjoyed remarkable stability such that the leadership was identical to what it had been at the beginning of 2008. So – two full years (2008 and 2009) of no change.</p>
         
         <p>In 2009 there was also stability in the Labor Cabinet. However, there was one change. On 4 June, Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon resigned as the result of a minor financial scandal. He was replaced by Senator John Faulkner. The new member of the cabinet was Chris Bowen, also from New South Wales (NSW), but unlike Fitzgibbon (from rural NSW), Bowen represents working‐class areas of Sydney.</p>
         
         <p>In September, came the news that two former Opposition leaders (Kim Beazley, Labor, who in 2007 had retired from politics, and Brendan Nelson, Liberal) had accepted diplomatic postings offered by Rudd. Beazley would be the ambassador to the United States and Nelson to the European Union. On Wednesday, 7 October, Nelson and his Liberal colleague, Peter Costello, resigned their seats. Soon after it was announced that both by‐elections would be held on Saturday, 5 December. Since both seats are blue ribbon Liberal, being located in wealthy suburban areas of Sydney (Bradfield) and Melbourne (Higgins), Labor announced it would not contest either by‐election. The Liberal Party's candidates, Paul Fletcher in Bradfield and Kelly O'Dwyer in Higgins, easily won the seats in competition with candidates from the Greens. The voting trend was seen by observers to be a good omen for the leadership of Tony Abbott, who is now universally regarded as the man who will lead the Liberal Party into the 2010 general election.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss9"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss9-title"> The Australian states</h2>
         
         <p>Governed by Labor since 1995, NSW has had three male premiers of that party: Bob Carr from March 1995, Morris Iemma from August 2005 and Nathan Rees from September 2008. Carr had won three general elections, in each of March 1995, 1999 and 2003, while Iemma had a single victory in March 2007. After a poor performance lasting just over a year, the NSW Labor caucus on Thursday, 3 December 2009 replaced Rees as premier. The voting was 21 for Rees and 47 for his challenger, Kristina Keneally, who became the first female premier of NSW. Keneally, 41 years of age, is unusual, being the first Australian political leader to be born in the United States. Ohio‐born she speaks with an American accent and came to Australia to marry her Australian husband whom she first met at a Catholic World Youth Congress in Poland in 1991. It was initially to further her husband's political ambitions that the couple decided to live in Australia. However, the Australian Labor Party's affirmative action rules meant that she won the safe seat intended for him.</p>
         
         <p>In terms of population, NSW is Australia's most populous state, followed by Victoria and then Queensland, which gained a female premier, Anna Bligh, in 2007 when she succeeded long‐term Labor premier, Peter Beattie. In 2009 Bligh became the first female Australian premier actually to win a general election. All the others had succeeded men and then went on to lose the next election. The Queensland election was held on Saturday, 21 March 2009, and resulted in the return of 51 Labor members, 34 for the Liberal‐National Party (LNP) and four others. In terms of votes, Labor won 1,002,415 first‐preference votes (42.2 per cent, down 4.7 percentage points on 2006), the LNP 987,018 (41.6 per cent, up 3.7) and the Greens 198,475 (8.4 per cent, up 0.4). All other parties and independent candidates secured a combined 184,743 votes, or 7.8 per cent.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss10"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss10-title"> Conclusion</h2>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, the Rudd Government was facing a dangerous opponent in the form of the new leader of the Liberal Party, Tony Abbott. In terms of preferred Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd is, nevertheless, ahead of Abbott by about two to one in the opinion polls of preference for the top job. There is much uncertainty about who will win the next general election, very likely to be held in August, September or October of 2010. It is true, however, that one needs to go back to December 1931 to find a case of a government defeated after only one term. On that basis, 2010 would see Rudd winning a second general election. On the other hand, 2010 is likely to see serious problems for Rudd in respect of asylum seekers and climate change policy. In these circumstances it would be unwise to make any predictions about the type of election and its result.</p>
