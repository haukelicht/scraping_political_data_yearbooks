         <p>On 17 March 2003, deputies and senators met together in Versailles – the so‐called ‘Congress’– in order to modify Article 1 of the Constitution of the French Republic adopted in 1958. By 584 votes (UMP, UDF and diverse moderates) against 278 (Communists, Socialists, Greens and Leftist radicals), the new article defined the ‘French Republic as indivisible’ as previously, but added that ‘its organization would be decentralized’. The project was to break the historical tradition of ‘jacobinism’ and give the regions more powers than those devoted to them by the first laws voted in 1982. Therefore, in accordance with the modification of Article 1, other articles were modified: some of them (Articles 13, 34, 37, 74) concerned Corsica and the TOM‐DOM, which can, by local referendum, change their territorial organization. However, the new Articles 72 and 73 also gave the region the right to organize a referendum on subjects not yet specified by the law.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>During the first six months of the year, Prime Minister J. P. Raffarin and his government began to implement the three main policies announced in 2002: law and order, decentralization, and the reform of pensions. As far as the first domain was concerned, the ‘law for domestic security’ increased the powers of the police and defined new crimes such as prostitution, or beggary. The increase in powers of the regions was made possible by the reform of the Constitution (see above). As a first step, the Government announced that, beginning in 2004, non‐teaching personnel (doctors, nurses, technicians, blue‐collar workers and administrative employees) would not be recruited and paid by the state, but by the regions. As a result, the teachers, fearful of a ‘privatization’ of the educational system, entered into a three‐month period of strikes and demonstrations (April–June). On the other hand, this ‘parochial’ protest was connected with other demonstrations and strikes organized by unions strongly rooted in the public sector (teachers, mail, rail, public transport in the main cities), whose workers opposed the reform of the pensions. Two points were at stake. First, public‐sector workers did not want to have to pay into the retirement system for 40 years (up from the previous 37.5 years) to receive a full pension. Second, and more generally, Raffarin's plan – for both the public sector and the private sector – sounded like a threat to the right of retirement at age 60. Any worker would have to pay into the retirement system for at least 40 years to receive a full pension.</p>
         
         <p>The left‐wing parties opposed the plan in Parliament. While Raffarin gained the support of the UMP majority, the UDF, which was theoretically a part of the parliamentary majority but was marginalized in the cabinet (see the entry on France in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>) was critical of the Government. First, the UDF argued that a referendum should be held on such an important question. Second, it stressed that Raffarin's proposal, in keeping special systems for some categories of workers (rail, public transport), violated the principle of equality. Finally, the UDF argued that the proposal failed to secure the long‐term financing of persons. Public opinion was also less than enthusiastic. According to IFOP surveys (April), 57 per cent of those interviewed agreed with the fact that ‘the public sector must contribute equally with the private sector into the retirement system’. Yet, at the same time, 51 per cent disagreed with the general reform. If we look to the people really concerned (salaried and not yet retired), the figure was 65 per cent against the reform.
         </p>
         
         <p>The popularity of the Prime Minister decreased: in January, 58 per cent of the people interviewed were ‘confident in his ability to handle the most important problems facing France’; the corresponding figure was 39 per cent in June (SOFRES). However, President J. Chirac largely escaped from this movement in so far as his decrease in popularity was smaller. In January, 52 per cent were confident in his ability (same SOFRES question); the figure was 49 per cent in June. First, the President was less involved in domestic issues. More important was the strong support he received as far as his positions on Iraq were concerned. The French agreed with all the points: to give more time to the United Nations inspectors; scepticism about the presence of illegal weapons in Iraq; refusal to participate in a war not decided by the United Nations, which would appear as an ‘American war’. In general, in January, 76 per cent of the people interviewed opposed a ‘war even approved by the United Nations’ (IFOP). The consensus went from the extreme left to the extreme right. The few dissenting voices – some intellectuals who thought that the real issue was the establishment of a democratic regime in Iraq; and some moderate leaders – were unlikely to be heard. Demonstrations in the streets were not as important as in Great Britain, Spain and Italy, for example, but in February, 81 per cent of the people interviewed felt ‘not convinced by Colin Powell's proofs (of illegal weapons) delivered at the United Nations’ (IFOP). Finally, on 20 March, according to another IFOP poll, 87 per cent opposed (69 per cent totally) ‘the military strike of the USA and their allies in Iraq’.</p>
         
         <p>The second half of the year was more difficult for the Government. Beyond the consensus on Iraq, opinion was divided on social issues. Since 2002, the Government had emphasized law and order issues. However, the increase in the rate of unemployment and the consequences of the reform of pensions made this issue less important. On the other hand and unfortunately, the government had to face two unexpected crises that became very important issues. The first one is perhaps typically French. In June, just before the festivals organized all around France in summer, the MEDEF (business unions) and two unrepresentative unions decided to change the insurance system of actors and technicians who do not have a permanent job and receive an income when they are unemployed. The immediate consequence was that the so‐called ‘intermittents du spectacle’ went on strike and many festivals, including the two most famous ones at Avignon and Aix‐en‐Provence had to be cancelled. The people concerned were strongly backed by all the artists and public opinion. The government was blamed for holding artists in contempt and for introducing mercantile considerations in a domain that has to escape from the laws of business.</p>
         
         <p>In August, an estimated 15,000 people – many of them elderly – died in the heat wave. The citizenry questioned the Government in many ways. First, the French did not understand the behaviour of the Government. The President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health were on holiday. Nobody returned to Paris. The President remained silent when the two others spoke from their holiday resorts and underestimated the number of dead people. In the second week of the month, back in Paris, the Government released a report blaming the administration, bureaucratic delays and hospital understaffing. In response, doctors and nurses opposed the Government, arguing that after years of cuts in the budget of public hospitals, they could not face the ‘disaster’. Finally, the French backed the medical personnel, and the high death toll triggered an angry debate over the actual shortcomings of the health system.</p>
         
         <p>The increase in the rate of unemployment, the reform of pensions and the crisis of the health system made social issues more important than crime and violence. Both the strikes of the teachers in March–June and of the artists in July put educational and cultural values under scrutiny. Dissatisfaction with the Government increased. In December, only 29 per cent of the people interviewed by the SOFRES thought that the Prime Minister could ‘handle the problems facing France’. The figure was 40 per cent for President Chirac.</p>
