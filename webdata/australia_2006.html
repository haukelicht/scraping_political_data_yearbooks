         <p>The year 2007 was dominated by the fact that a general election was due towards the end of the year. As things turned out the election was called for Saturday, 24 November. It resulted in a Labor victory. That meant that, as predicted in last year's entry (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2007</a></span>: 875), Labor governments are now installed in all nine Australian jurisdictions. It is a record for the party. Back in the second half of 1968 and the first half of 1969 (what we in Australia call ‘the financial year 1968–69’), Labor was out of power everywhere. Never before has it been in power everywhere. For details on the states and territories see below.
         </p>
         
         <p>On Monday, 4 December 2006 the caucus of the federal parliamentary Labor Party installed a new leadership team: Kevin Rudd (Queensland) as leader and Julia Gillard (Victoria) as his deputy. My reaction to that news was immediate. I confidently predicted a Labor victory at the 2007 general election (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006b</a></span>). Other observers were not convinced. Two biographies of Kevin Rudd came out in the (Australian) autumn of 2007, one authorised, the other not. The unauthorised biography (see <span title=""><a href="#b11" id="#b11R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Stuart 2007</a></span>: 262–265) noted that many commentators and even Labor politicians were very cautious about whether the opposition could overcome the government in spite of clear opinion poll leads for Rudd, who only needed just over 3 per cent of voters to change their minds in order to beat Howard. These doubts did not take account of the latter's detachment from voters and the complacency and arrogance of the government, whose victories in 2001 and 2004 disguised underlying weaknesses. Yet they also reflected a concern that voters may be turned off by the prospect of Labor dominating both state and federal government if it were to win.
         </p>
         
         <p>All this gives a clue to a most unusual feature of the 2007 election. Throughout the year, all fifty opinion polls showed Labor winning. Moreover, this occurred in respect of a country whose people felt very good about themselves and their country. They were rich as never before, with full employment, economic growth and every indication that other nations were envious of their happy lot. Why on earth, so many pundits would ask, would such people wish to kick out their government? The answer was contained in my entries over the last two years in the <i>Political Data Yearbook</i> (<span title=""><a href="#b5%20#b6%20#b7" id="#b5 #b6 #b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006, 2007</a></span>): the so‐called ‘Work Choices’ legislation and Howard's deceit in relation to it (see below).

            <p>Previous entries have commented on the difficulty Labor has had in getting the right leadership team. After the installation of the Rudd‐Gillard leadership it quickly became clear that the party had got it right at last. Consequently, the decision was made to make ‘New Leadership’ the slogan for the election campaign. Such a choice was made all the more easy by the fact that the Howard Government would not be availing itself of leadership change. To the extent that the Australian people had become tired of the leadership of John Howard, the Labor Party had the issue all to itself.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005</h3>
            
            <p>The reason Howard was headed for defeat was his insistence that Parliament pass the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005. Two years ago I noted how Howard's Senate majority had made it possible for him to achieve a long‐held ambition: the so‐called ‘labour market reform’ or ‘deregulation of the labour market’ (<span title=""><a href="#b5%20#b6" id="#b5 #b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006</a></span>: 1038–1039).
            </p>
            
            <p>Few people in 2006 realised the extent to which Howard brought danger to himself by that enactment. The explanation appears to be that the weakness of the leadership of Kim Beazley caused the opinion polls to show better results for Howard than was really the case. The other irony is that, during his first three terms (1996–2004, inclusive), Howard – often seen as a control freak – seemed to fret about his lack of power due to lack of Senate majority. Ironically, when that majority came, it led to his defeat in 2007 by enabling him to implement his plans for ‘reform’ of industrial relations laws – an illustration perhaps of the aptness of the aphorism ‘be careful what you wish for’.</p>

            <p>John Howard represented the northwestern Sydney suburban seat of Bennelong from his first election there in May 1974 right through until his defeat in that seat at the November 2007 general election. Prior to that event (i.e., the Howard Government being defeated and Howard himself defeated in Bennelong), there had only ever been one case of such a double defeat. In October 1929, conservative Stanley Melbourne Bruce called a ‘snap’ general election at which his government was defeated unexpectedly. There were no opinion polls in those days and no one predicted that Bruce would be defeated in his own seat of Flinders (Victoria), which was perceived at the time to be a safe seat. It was a shock result. Bruce easily regained that seat at the next election. However, his absence from the House of Representatives during the term of the Scullin Labor Government (1929–1932) meant that Bruce never regained the office of prime minister.</p>
            
            <p>The 2007 Bennelong case was similar, but also very different. During the year, every one of the fifty opinion polls showed that the Howard Government would be defeated nationally and every one of the seven local opinion polls showed that Howard would lose Bennelong. Yet there continued to be a strange reluctance by pundits (other than myself) to predict Howard's double loss. This was more or less understandable before Labor chose its candidate, but such attitudes continued even after the selection, in February 2007, of Maxine McKew to contest the seat for Labor. She had been a high‐profile broadcaster for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and was, by any standard, a very good candidate. After her selection, pundits started to become somewhat more restrained in their dismissal of Labor's chances of defeating the prime minister. Yet, even then, no pundit (apart from me) would confidently predict Howard's defeat and McKew's victory.</p>
            
            <p>The Bennelong case and the post‐election leadership of the Liberal Party (see below) illustrate an unusual feature of Australian punditry. There is a strong assumption that the betting odds give a better prediction than the opinion polls. The betting odds always had Howard the clear favourite to win his seat again. As one journalist (<span title=""><a href="#b10" id="#b10R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Saville 2007</a></span>: iv) wrote of McKew:
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>In the beginning, she was so far behind Howard that you could have bet on her winning with odds of $4.50. Only one political expert gave her the slightest chance – the rest said that Howard would stand down for Costello in the next term, and Maxine would win the by‐election.</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>The point really is whether you see the result as a personal triumph for McKew (Saville's view) or as the defeat of John Howard (my view). However, Saville is correct about the betting odds. They continued to favour Howard in Bennelong – even when Labor, later in the year, became favourite to win the general election as a whole. For example, by June the odds on the general election result as a whole were effectively suggesting a fifty‐fifty chance, but in Bennelong they were Howard $1.28, McKew $3.25 and any other candidate $51. Then in September there appeared this report in <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>:
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>The punters of Australia have spoken. In the only poll that matters, they have put their money on Labor. The betting agency Centrebet said yesterday that due to a rush of money this week, the odds for the election had become (for a $1 investment): John Howard $2.85, Kevin Rudd $1.43. Six months ago they were Howard $1.40, Rudd $2.75. Speaking in the quaint jargon of the industry, Centrebet's Neil Evans said ‘the head‐to‐head hold in the PM book had passed $1 million’, with $45,000 plunged on Rudd on Tuesday alone.</p>
<p>‘Even at the short price, the “smart” money for the Opposition has been overwhelming – we've had bets of between $5,000 and $15,000 in the past 24 hours – and some of it from closely connected political quarters,’ Evans said. ‘Around $600,000 has been traded on Labor and about $430,000 on the Coalition.’ The Prime Minister does better in his electorate, where the odds are: Howard $1.50, Maxine McKew $2.40, any other candidate $51.</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>What is interesting about these odds is that it took quite so long – in the light of the opinion polls – for the betting odds to turn around. The explanation is that Howard had won four general elections in succession, in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004. He had thus established a reputation as an electoral genius. Even as he was comprehensively bungling his fourth term (2005–2007), many pundits would attribute political savvy to acts of his that were actually quite disastrous. In the case of Maxine McKew, these pundits could not see that she was deadly serious in her determination to defeat Howard in 2007, and not wait for three years for him to retire or for a by‐election caused by his resignation.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss6"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss6-title"> The campaign</h3>
            
            <p>The House of Representatives was dissolved on Wednesday, 17 October and thus began the election campaign proper. It produced three facts of interest. The first was that Howard explicitly stated that, if re‐elected, he would retire ‘well into’ the new term, with Peter Costello becoming prime minister. In that event, he would retire from his Bennelong seat at the 2010 general election so as not to embarrass Costello with a difficult by‐election. Second, there was one televised debate between Howard and Rudd. Held on Sunday, 21 October, it was generally seen as won by Rudd. It was the third fact about the campaign that was of most interest. At its monthly meeting on Wednesday, 7 November, the Reserve Bank raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. It was the second time that the Reserve Bank had raised rates during the year (the first was in August) and the first time ever that rates had been raised twice in an election year. Interest rates had been at their lowest in 2002 and were raised ten times during the years from 2002 to 2007, inclusive.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss7"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss7-title"> Post‐election Liberal Party leadership contest</h3>
            
            <p>It was clear on election night that the Howard Government had been defeated and that Howard himself had lost in Bennelong. Consequently, in his concession speech, Howard recommended that his party should choose the then Deputy Leader, Peter Costello, to be the new leader. However, Howard knew at the time something that was not known to the general public – namely that Costello was not interested in taking over the leadership of his defeated party. Costello knew his Australian political history. To be the first Leader of the Opposition after a government has been defeated is, historically speaking, close to a guarantee that you will never become prime minister. Consequently, on the following day (Sunday, 25 November) Costello announced that he would not stand for the position, but would seek to leave politics for the commercial world.</p>
            
            <p>The newspapers visibly gloated at this shock news. For example, <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> ran the headline ‘Rudd and rudderless’. Under the sub‐heading ‘Libs implode as Costello bales out’, their chief political correspondent, Phillip Coorey, wrote of a ‘leadership free‐for‐all [which] developed amid internal recriminations. Key reasons cited for the loss were the Government's Work Choices laws and Mr Howard's refusal to step aside for Mr Costello and allow generational change’.
            </p>
            
            <p>The leadership contest actually took place on Thursday, 29 November and there were only two candidates: Dr Brendan Nelson, who polled 45 votes and Mr Malcolm Turnbull who polled 42 votes. Both men represent wealthy parts of the Sydney metropolitan area. The deputy leadership position was won by Ms Julie Bishop, who represents wealthy parts of the Perth metropolitan area.</p>
            
            <p>In the light of the way it turned out in the end it is worthwhile looking at the betting odds for John Howard's successor as leader of the Liberal Party. These were published early in August and were $1.27 for Peter Costello, $4.00 for Malcolm Turnbull, $8.00 for any other candidate, $9.00 for Brendan Nelson, $15.00 for Tony Abbott, $51.00 for Julie Bishop and $51.00 also for Alexander Downer. At the same time as those odds were quoted, the Bennelong odds were $1.38 for John Howard, $2.70 for Maxine McKew and $22.00 for any other candidate.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile the leadership of the Nationals also needed to be determined as their leader, Mark Vaile, stood down too in the light of the Coalition's defeat and his party's poor performance. He was succeeded by Warren Truss.</p>

            <p>March 2002 witnessed what seemed at the time to be the end of a process that had been going on for some years. It is now the case that all six State premiers and both Territory chief ministers are from the Labor Party – namely the party that, until late in 2007, constituted the federal Opposition. At the beginning of 2007, in order of seniority, these Labor leaders of the States/Territories were: Peter Beattie (Queensland, gaining office in June 1998), Steve Bracks (Victoria, October 1999), Clare Martin (Northern Territory, August 2001), Jon Stanhope (Australian Capital Territory, November 2001), Mike Rann (South Australia, March 2002), Paul Lennon (Tasmania, March 2004, who succeeded upon the death of Labor's Jim Bacon), Morris Iemma (New South Wales, August 2005, who succeeded upon the resignation of Labor's Bob Carr) and Alan Carpenter (Western Australia, January 2006, who succeeded upon the resignation of Labor's Geoff Gallop). While John Howard seemed determined not to retire gracefully, no less than three of these State/Territory leaders did exactly that during 2007. Consequently on 30 July, the office of Premier of Victoria passed from Steve Bracks to John Brumby, on 13 September the office of Premier of Queensland passed from Peter Beattie to Anna Bligh and on 26 November the office of Chief Minister of the Northern Territory passed from Clare Martin to Paul Henderson. At the beginning of 2007, Clare Martin was Australia's only female leader in government. At year's end, there were two significant female leaders: Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh.</p>
            
            <p>The general election in New South Wales on 24 March 2007 was very easy to predict. With its system of fixed dates there was no uncertainty on that score. The result, too, was never in serious doubt: Labor won easily, albeit with a reduced majority. With a four‐year term in New South Wales (as opposed to three years federally and in Queensland) that means Labor is secure in our most populous state until March 2011. Since Labor (under Bob Carr) had first won in March 1995 that means Labor will have been in office in New South Wales for 16 years.</p>
            
            <p>There are two reasons why Labor is so successful in Australia at present. The first is that Labor governments avoid radical changes: only so‐called ‘conservatives’ go in for insanely ideological measures like ‘Work Choices’. The second is that Labor leaders seem to know when it is time to retire. The Liberal Party can learn much from Labor's success, if it has the gumption to do so. It can also look to its own past. It was the Liberal Party, after all, that produced Australia's greatest prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies, who retired gracefully in January 1966 after a total of more than 18 years in the top job.</p>
