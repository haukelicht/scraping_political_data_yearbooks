         <p>The Swiss federal elections of 2003 were historical in many ways. The Swiss People's Party (SVP) was the major winner and improved its overall share of the votes to 26.7 per cent. Such a gain (of 4.2 per cent) is exceptional, and the national conservative party became the strongest party seen in Swiss politics in 60 years. In the canton of Thurgau, the party received 40 per cent of the votes, and in Zurich one‐third. However, the most remarkable result was in the French‐speaking part of Switzerland: whereas in 1999 only 8.7 per cent of the voters chose the SVP, in 2003 the number increased to 18.4 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>This landslide went hand‐in‐hand with powerful blows to the classic centre parties: the Radical Free Democrats (FDP) and the Christian Democratic Party (CVP). Both parties suffered severe defeat, and the 17.3 per cent and 14.4 per cent of the votes they received, respectively, meant that they achieved the worst result since proportional elections were introduced in 1919. The other winners in the election are to be found in the left‐wing block, with the Green Party (GPS, FGA) increasing its share of the vote by 2.4 per cent of the vote, and the Social Democrats (SPS) obtaining an additional 0.8 per cent.</p>

         <p>The impact of the parliamentary elections on cabinet composition was also historical. On election day, the SVP announced on television that either its leader, Christoph Blocher, would be given a seat on the Federal Council – the party thus having a second representative – or they would leave the Government and break with the so‐called ‘magic formula’ (i.e., the Federal Council composition, unaltered since 1959, of two radicals, two socialists, two Christian democrats and one member of the SVP). Even if it was perhaps inevitable that the magic formula would be challenged again, the way the party handled the situation was very new to Swiss so‐called ‘concordance’, and a cold, raw wind of political communications followed the October elections. Consequently, the Government election on 10 December was far reaching for Switzerland's Federal Assembly in three ways. First, the magic formula, unaltered since 1959, was changed, and the SVP won a second seat. Second, for the first time in 130 years, a serving minister was not re‐elected; the right‐wing party won its second seat at the expense of the youngest member, the Christian Democrat, Ruth Metzler. Finally, unlike earlier terms, the FDP replacement for the outgoing Councilor, Kaspar Villiger, was of minor importance, and this caused a third surprise: originally, it was thought that if the right‐wing candidate, Christoph Blocher, was elected, the more liberal, female candidate, Christine Beerli, would defeat the competitor, Hans‐Rudolf Merz, who was considered to have a profile closer to Blocher. Yet parliament voted for the male candidate, causing a wave of national protest among more than just the left‐wing women's movement. In this regard, 10 December serves as an indication that the mood in Parliament was leaning towards the right, even though the actual numbers of seats were not indicative of this.</p>

         <p>The year 2003 was of much political relevance for Switzerland, but it began with apathy at the polls. The turnout for the February ballot on popular rights and hospital costs came to only 29 per cent, one of the lowest ever. In the period from 1992 to 2002, the average turnout was 44 per cent, and since the introduction of women's suffrage in 1971, only two other referenda (June 1972 and March 1973) have had lower participation rates. The data from the survey taken immediately after the ballot (VOX‐Analysis) give a clear explanation of what happened. The campaigns only started at the beginning of 2003, and were both short and unobtrusive. Furthermore, the political actors showed little energy.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3%20#t4%20#t5" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The referendum against the urgent law for investment by the cantons in costs for in‐patient treatment (‘hospital costs’) was only supported by ‘Assura’ Insurance, which initiated the referendum. All other interested parties agreed on the reform, which was based on a judgment of the Federal Insurance Court. The ‘people's right’ reform – which both the SVP and SPS spoke against – was more controversial, but was not a high priority in an election year. Consequently, voters’ use of mass media was relatively low, and they relied chiefly on the official information bulletin (<i>Bundesbüchlein</i>) to make a decision. Overall, voters considered the ballot unimportant, and had problems coming to a decision, as their knowledge of the issue was crude. While usually about three‐fifths of participants in a ballot have a moderate to high level of knowledge of the issue, this time the level of knowledge was much lower (87 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively, had a low level of competence). (Index based on knowledge about the ballot (title and content) as well as the ability to explain the vote.) To sum up, this ballot gives a very illustrative example of the so‐called ‘<i>cens chaché</i>’ that rules Swiss referenda. When people are unsure how to vote, they prefer to choose the exit option (i.e., they do not participate at all). In view of the fear of populist abuse and manipulation, this might be comforting. Compared to the ideal of people's rule, however, the ballot of 9 February is quite alarming: if we look at the numbers voting ‘For’, we see that in this instance about 16 per cent of the adult population ruled Switzerland (934,005 ‘Yes’ votes of 5,897,300 adults above 18 living in Switzerland).
         </p>
         
         <p>This is all the more remarkable given that one of the issues of the ballot was concerned with popular rights. However, the content and history of this reform show why turnout was so low. The bill dates back to the reform of the federal constitution in 1996, which included a so‐called ‘popular rights package’,<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> but was subject to several adjournments and curtailments. In summer 1999, the package failed in the initial debate in the lower house, chiefly because the introduction of new instruments for direct democracy went hand‐in‐hand with an increase in the numbers of signatures needed. Shortly after that, the upper house reacted with a parliamentary initiative.<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a> Here the aim was ‘neither to ease nor to hamper popular rights but to correct faults’ in the existing laws. Thus, the two aspects of the revision put to the vote in February 2003 were considered to be rather unimportant.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ‘general popular initiative’ requires the submission of 100,000 signatures for a general proposal. In contrast to the older so‐called ‘general suggestion’ (<i>allgemeine Anregung</i>), which could only be used for amending the Constitution, the new ‘general popular initiative’ (<i>allgemeine Volksinitiative</i>) can also be used for amending, changing or repealing laws. More precisely, the people submit an idea, and afterwards Parliament decides whether to propose a constitutional amendment or law. Furthermore, the reform brought a minor extension to the referendum: international treaties. The new provision would allow a referendum with 50,000 signatures against any international treaty dealing with important laws or binding legal effects.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second issue concerned an Urgent Federal Arrêtés (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Church 2004</a></span>), introduced after the Federal Court of Insurance ordered cantons to contribute to costs caused by in‐patient treatment for those under compulsory as well private or semi‐private insurance. The insurance agency ‘Assura’ launched the referendum because the decree designed a systematic procedure for presenting the cantons with the bill instead of presenting the financial strain immediately and entirely. However, Parliament supported the law unanimously, and voters did so with 70 per cent of the vote.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 18 May, Swiss voters had to decide on seven popular initiatives and two referenda. This was a record and the first time since 1866 that so many ballots were submitted simultaneously. However, the 49.6 per cent turnout was only a little above the average of the previous years and the vote against all seven popular initiatives came as no surprise. Asked to score the proposals with regard to personal and national relevance, the voters said that the ‘non‐nuclear energy’ initiative was the most important. This proposal aimed at a restriction of the operating life of nuclear power plants (i.e., to close the oldest nuclear plants – Gösgen and Leibstadt) in 2009 and 2014, respectively, and to replace them with environmentally friendly power plants. A very similar but less radical initiative put to the vote on 18 May called for a ten‐year extension to the moratorium (‘moratorium plus’) on the construction of nuclear power plants approved by voters in 1990. However, this also failed, with 41.6 per cent voting ‘For’; in contrast to 1990, the environmentalist movement was unable to mobilize voters beyond the green‐ and left‐oriented. ‘For’ and ‘Against’ voters varied in judgment about the security of nuclear power plants, and ‘Against’ voters also listed the economic objections raised by the Government. Nevertheless, the <i>ex post</i> VOX‐Analysis revealed that both supporters and opponents of the initiatives are against the installation of new plants.
         </p>
         
         <p>A total of 72.9 per cent voted against the initiative ‘for affordable health care’, which opposed the existing insurance funding system and called for premiums to be indexed to income and assets, and the raising of VAT in order to increase funds. Social Democrats and initiators of the proposal failed to rally, and the VOX‐Analysis revealed that, even among their sympathizers, only 59 per cent supported the radical change in health insurance.</p>
         
         <p>Disabled persons in Switzerland live under poor conditions, and the so‐called initiative for ‘equal rights for the disabled’ aimed at mitigating some of these disadvantages. Only around 30 per cent of public facilities and services are adapted to the disabled, and the initiative launched in 1999 called for measures to be taken and for better access. Authorities recommended voting against, but at the same time developed a less expensive counter‐proposal to come into effect in 2004. Actually, motivations to vote against were in line with the Federal Council's public relations’ recommendations. Some 33 per cent focused on economic factors, 30 per cent considered the proposal to be too radical and 25 per cent argued that the recently passed law was sufficient.</p>
         
         <p>The popular initiatives for ‘one car‐free Sunday per season’, ‘fair housing rents’ and the initiative for improved apprenticeships and ‘adequate vocational training’ were all launched by green, leftist and tenants’ rights associations. Only left‐wing voters opted for these proposals and rejection rates were between 62.4 and 68.4 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The two laws regarding the reform of the ‘army and military administration’ and ‘the protection of the population and civil defense’ were considered a package. All social and political strata rejected the referenda against the Army XXI reform and the reform of the civil defense system. Even right‐wing groups in opposition to a smaller and more flexible army voted overwhelmingly ‘For’. In other words, the divide between army opponents and supporters was not visible, and the conservative referendum committee was not able to raise the neutrality issue. The majority simply voted on the Federal Council's recommendations and had problems explaining their behavior in the <i>ex post</i> survey.
