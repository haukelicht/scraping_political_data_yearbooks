         <p>The month of January 2006 was dominated by the presidential elections, campaigning for which had started before Christmas. Opinion polls predicted a landslide victory for Anibal Cavaco Silva, Prime Minister between 1985 and 1995, and formerly Professor of Economics at the New University in Lisbon and later at the Catholic University Lisbon, who was supported by the right of centre opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party (<i>Partido Socialdemocrata</i>, PSD) and the Democratic Social Centre‐People's Party (<i>Centro Democratico Social‐Partido Popular</i>). Cavaco Silva, who lost the presidential elections in 1995 against Jorge Sampaio, presented a moderate image that suggested he would cooperate with the Prime Minister and emphasised the economic and political stability of the country. Cavaco Silva drew some authority from his successful period as Prime Minister, which was one of the most stable periods of the young Portuguese democracy.
         </p>
         
         <p>The governing Socialist Party (<i>Partido Socialista</i>, PS) was split between two candidates. Originally, the party and Government had lent their initial support to the MP and Poet Manuel Alegre, but when 80 year‐old former President, Mário Soares, decided to take part in the elections, Prime Minister José Socrates shifted his party to Mário Soares, thereby splitting the Socialist vote between two candidates. The Communist Party wanted to support a common candidate of the left with the Socialist Party, but after this was rejected, its leader, Jerónimo de Sousa, was put forward as the party's candidate. De Sousa's leadership contributed to a better atmosphere within the party whose rigidity and orthodoxy he had tried to overcome – an effort to which voters responded positively in elections. Two left‐wing candidates (Francisco Louçã and Antonio Garcia Pereira), supported respectively by the parliamentary Block of the Left (<i>Bloco da Esquerda</i>, BE) and the extra‐parliamentary Movement for the Reorganisation of the Party of the Proletariate/Communist Party of the Portuguese Workers (<i>Partido Comunista dos Trabalhadores Portugueses/Movimento Reorganizativo do Partido do Proletariado</i>, PCTP‐MRPP), also took part in these elections.
         </p>
         
         <p>Throughout the entire campaign period, the opinion polls predicted a victory for Cavaco Silva in the first round. On election day, 22 January 2006, Cavaco Silva managed to win more than 50 per cent of the votes and become the next president. However, he was quite disappointed that he was not able to get a clearer mandate, particularly in the south, which is a stronghold of communists and socialists. In terms of electoral geography, his vote was quite strong in northern Portugal, and the autonomous islands of Madeira and Azores. In the south, he was able to do well only in his native Algarve, but not in Alentejo. Surprisingly, Manuel Alegre came a distant second and beat established former President Mário Soares into a humiliating third place. Soares was the big loser of these elections – a result that reflected badly on the leadership skills of Prime Minister José Socrates, who supported Soares during the campaign. The other left‐wing candidates got results below the 10 per cent threshold and were not able to surpass the share of the vote of their constituencies during normal elections (<i>Expresso</i>, 28 January 2006).

         <p>The Socrates Government had one major reshuffle during 2006, which took place on 3 July, when Foreign Minister Diogo Freitas do Amaral, despite the best efforts of the Prime Minister, resigned due to a painful and exhausting medical condition that would require several operations. The Minister of National Defence, Luis Amado, replaced him. The new Minister of National Defence was Nuno Severiano Teixeira, who held the same office during the second Guterres Government (1999–2001). Severiano Teixeira is a prestigious Professor of International Relations at the New University Lisbon and founder of the new Portuguese Institute of International Relations. His experience in defence and security issues goes back to his PhD, earned at the European University Institute, on the role of Portugal in the foundation of NATO. He was also director in the 1990s of the National Defence Institute attached to the Ministry of Defence. Luis Amado was a junior minister in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guterres's second Government. In contrast to Nuno Severiano Teixeira, he made a party political career, first as a regional MP in Madeira and then as a national MP in the Assembly of the Republic.</p>

         <p>After a year in office, the Socrates Government initiated several major reforms in order to improve the dire prospects of the Portuguese economy. According to the report of the European Commission and the Bank of Portugal, the budget deficit increased from 4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 2004 to 6 per cent in 2005. This alarming deterioration of the budget deficit considerably exceeded the permitted threshold of 3 per cent of GDP stipulated by the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union. The new Socrates Government agreed in 2005 with the European Commission to reduce the budget deficit to below the threshold by 2009. This would be achieved by the introduction of major reforms in the economy, public administration, the education sector and the health system. All these measures were designed to modernise the public sector, but also to reduce public expenditure substantially. Among the measures were the introduction of English as compulsory language in the school system at an early age, the reduction of privileges for politicians (particularly those that were able to find a job in the private sector after their time in public office), a complete overhaul of the public administration creating a new system of promotion and the introduction of major changes in the pension system. Moreover, during 2005 and 2006, auditors assessed the potential for closures and mergers in order to shrink the state. It was planned to close 1,500 schools across the country that had less than twenty pupils. All of these reforms will only show results in the future.</p>
         
         <p>Another of the major problems for the Government was the weak growth rate in 2005, which was 0.5 per cent of GDP – the lowest in the advanced democracies. In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted for 2006 the lowest growth of 0.8 per cent of GDP and a continuing budget deficit of 4.6 per cent (<i>Expresso</i>, 28 February 2006, 4 March 2006, 14 April 2006: 2; <i>Diario Noticias</i>, Economia: 1–3).Unemployment increased from 6.7 to 7.7 per cent in 2005, reaching half a million people (8 per cent) in the middle of the year, and was predicted to rise until 2008 to between 9 and 10 per cent (<i>Expresso</i>, 18 February 2006). In mid‐April, the Government was able to achieve a consensual agreement with six of the seven social partners about the reform of unemployment subsidy. Only the Confederation of Portuguese Industry did not endorse the agreement because it felt that the restrictions on dismissal were still too costly.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Socrates Government was able to count on the support of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) under its leader, Luis Marques Mendes. This cooperation covered important areas such as the reform of the justice system, the negotiation of a new electoral law that envisaged a reduction in the number of MPs from 230 to 150–180, the introduction of uninominal constituencies and moderation in the referendum on abortion scheduled for early 2007. Discussions on the electoral system continued throughout 2006 and were not resolved at the end of the year, with the smaller parties opposing any reform that would reduce their parliamentary representation.</p>
         
         <p>It was also difficult to achieve agreement on the reform of social security. Different models were presented by the Government and the opposition, respectively. The Government model emphasised social security remaining in the public sector, while the PSD wanted the introduction of a mixed system that included the private sector as well. The President advised Prime Minister Sócrates to negotiate a compromise with the PSD, which was rejected. However, in July, the Government was able to achieve an agreement with six of the seven social partners in this reform of social security. Only the communist General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (<i>Confederação Geral dos Trabalhadores Portugueses</i>, CGTP‐In) refused to endorse it due to its negative repercussions for pensioners (CES 2006).
         </p>
         
         <p>During February, the main party of the opposition and the vast majority of the population were unhappy with the fact that Minister of Foreign Affairs Diogo Freitas do Amaral failed to condemn violence in Arab countries against the publication of the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in Denmark. In March, Freitas do Amaral had to deal with the expulsion of 15,000 Portuguese who were working illegally in Canada. Freitas do Amaral decided to travel to Canada to ask for more flexibility from the Canadian authorities, which he achieved. Well‐integrated Portuguese were no longer required to return to Portugal (<i>Expresso</i>, 1 April 2006).
         </p>
         
         <p>Before the Easter holidays, several bills could not be approved because the necessary quorum of MPs was lacking. The absenteeism of MPs was vehemently criticised by the President of the Republic. This affected particularly the MPs of the two main parties – PS and PSD. In an opinion poll conducted for the weekly newspaper <i>Expresso</i>, the positive evaluation of Parliament's performance reached its lowest level at just 26 per cent (<i>Expresso</i>, 6 May 2006).
         </p>
         
         <p>In early June, the new President of the Republic, Anibal Cavaco Silva, vetoed a law designed to promote gender equality on electoral lists for legislative and European Parliament elections, requiring a minimum of a third of the candidates to be of either sex. Failing to comply would entail a drastic loss in public party funds. The Socialist Government decided to make the necessary changes, but deliberations were not concluded at the end of the year (<i>Expresso</i>, 3 June 2006). President Cavaco Silva did endorse a Government bill on Medically Assisted Fertility. The two right‐of‐centre opposition parties, PSD and CDS‐PP, were disappointed and wanted the President to consult the Constitutional Court before ratifying the measure.
         </p>
         
         <p>In October and November, the Socialist Government had to deal with growing public discontent. In October, a demonstration against the Government's austerity policies was supported by 80,000–100,000 people. Furthermore, on 9–10 November, a two‐day strike of civil servants took place against the modernisation measures introduced by the Government. In July and November, the military also went to the streets to protest against cuts in their benefits. In spite of the implementation of a difficult reform package, Prime Minister José Socrates sustained a substantial lead in terms of popularity in relation to the other leaders. In December, the monthly opinion poll of the <i>Expresso</i> newspaper gave him a substantial lead of 60 per cent in relation to PSD leader Marques Mendes (40 per cent), BE leader Francisco Louçã (39 per cent), Communist leader Jerónimo de Sousa (35 per cent) and CDS‐PP leader José Ribeiro e Castro (32 per cent). Moreover, in terms of voting intentions, the Socialist Party led the opinion polls with 38.9 per cent, followed by PSD with 27.7 per cent, the Communists with 7.7 per cent, BE with 7 per cent and CDS‐PP with a very weak 4.1 per cent.

         <p>In the party conference of 16–17 March 2006, PSD leader Luis Marques Mendes was able to strengthen support for his leadership. He could count on the support of all the factions of the party. His proposal to introduce primaries for the leadership was accepted by the conference. The first primaries were conducted on 5 May 2006 and led to an overwhelming victory of the single candidate – himself. Meanwhile, the Democratic Social Centre‐People's Party (<i>Centro Democratico e Social‐Partido Popular</i>, CDS‐PP) organised an extraordinary party conference on 6 May in order to allow critics of leader José Ribeiro e Castro to stand against him. However, shortly before the party conference, it became known that no one would do so, although there was speculation that former charismatic leader of party Paulo Portas would challenge him in 2007. One of the main criticisms was that José Ribeiro e Castro was not able to improve the standing of the party and his being a Member of European Parliament was causing problems in coordination of his leadership of the party. Ribeiro e Castro had to deal with a high level of debt, without any funding for political activities. The overall negative deficit was €1.3 million, of which €700,000 was bank loans (<i>Expresso</i>, 3 June 2006).
         </p>
         
         <p>The party conference of the Socialist Party took place on 11–12 November. José Socrates was able to count on strong support for his leadership and a strong endorsement to continue the difficult reform programme. Although there were no party conferences in the Communist Party and the BE, both took important strategic decisions. The Communists decided on a programme of rejuvenation of the leadership of the party in order to give themselves a new image, finding inspiration in the new left‐wing populism of Latin American leaders in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia. The BE was very keen to continue on the path of expansion, particularly in the regions that are most neglected by the main political parties – especially in inner Portugal.</p>
