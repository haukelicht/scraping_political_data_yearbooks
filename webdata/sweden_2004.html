         <p>The year 2005 in Swedish politics was comparatively quiet. The cabinet remained unchanged: the first year since 1997 without any personnel changes, and the first time since 1993 that no one left or joined the cabinet. The only slight alteration was a minor reorganization of ministries on 1 January, which had been decided and announced in October 2004 (for details, see <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a> and <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2005</a></span>: 1201ff). The cooperation agreement between the governing Social Democratic Party and the Green and Left support parties, in place since 1998, continued and looked like surviving a second consecutive parliamentary term. Still, the year was a difficult one for the governing party, and the four‐party opposition bloc grew in confidence. All parties were increasingly focused on the election due to be held in September 2006.

         <p>Opinion polls looked very negative for the government. For most of the year, the opposition parties were ahead, often by a clear margin. The Social Democrats were down to support levels of just over 30 per cent, on occasion overtaken by the Moderate Party as the country's most popular party. In addition, Prime Minister Göran Persson's personal ratings were worrying. Persson's popularity had grown following the Swedish European Union (EU) presidency in the first half of 2001, but declined following the referendum on the Euro in 2003, and the slump continued in 2005. There were several possible reasons for the negative trend. Most significant was the debate regarding the government's handling of the tsunami disaster that took place in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. A total of 543 Swedish nationals, mostly on holiday in Thailand, died. An intense debate followed in which the government as a whole, as well as individual ministries, were criticized. The critics focused on Göran Persson and the Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds, who appeared slow to realize the seriousness of the situation. At least as important was the fact that the government lacked the organization to respond to a crisis, a problem that had been identified already in the aftermath of the Estonia ferry disaster in 1994. This criticism was reinforced in December 2005, when a Commission of Inquiry, chaired by the judge Johan Hirschfeldt, presented its report. Criticism had been expected, but its severity came as a surprise. Three ministers, including Persson and Freivalds, were criticized, as well as a number of named officials. The lack of communication within and between government ministries was highlighted, as well as the slow response by individuals and ministries. The critics demanded resignations, but none happened immediately. Göran Persson, who was the most heavily criticized minister, could not sack others without resigning himself. In addition, the parliamentary Committee on the Constitution began its own inquiry, due to be presented in the winter of 2006. It was seen as possible that the report could lead to changes in the government.</p>
         
         <p>There were also problems in the Left Party, one of the government's support parties. The Left Party leader since 2004, Lars Ohly, is regarded as a left‐winger and has called himself a communist. This is controversial in a party that is split between ‘traditionalists’ and ‘renewers’, the latter intent on abandoning all remnants of communism. The former faction has had the upper hand under Ohly's leadership, and a number of ‘renewers’ have defected. Towards the end of 2005, Ohly appeared to reassess his position on communism, but it seemed to have little impact on the defectors and remaining internal critics. At the same time, Ohly began to open up for a possible formal coalition with the Social Democrats after the 2006 election, and his new position on communism could be interpreted as an attempt to make his party more suitable as a coalition partner. The Green Party has also envisaged participation in a coalition.</p>
         
         <p>At the same time, however, the opposition bloc, consisting of the Moderate, Centre and Christian Democratic parties and the People's Party Liberals, grew in confidence. In 2004, they had launched an initiative called ‘Alliance for Sweden’ with the purpose of securing a majority in the 2006 election and preparing for a subsequent coalition government. The Alliance initiative includes six working groups in policy areas that are considered crucial for the successful formation, and subsequent survival, of a coalition government. The six working group chairs were, together with the four party leaders, regarded by some commentators as an embryonic ‘shadow cabinet’. Key issues remained unresolved and included energy, family policy and sickness benefits, but the general impression was still that the opposition parties were better prepared for government than they had been for a long time.</p>
         
         <p>A key asset for the opposition was the Moderate leader Fredrik Reinfeldt, who in 2005 overtook Göran Persson as the country's most popular party leader in opinion polls. In charge of his party since 2003, Reinfeldt is virtually certain to become prime minister in the event of an election victory for the opposition parties. He has tried to soften his party's cold and technocratic image, and reassessed its earlier strident positions on areas such as taxation and labour market legislation. Not uncontroversial among some groups inside the party, the reorientation has so far been successful, as borne out in opinion polls. Reinfeldt's reasoned and pragmatic leadership style is regarded as a contrast to Persson, who is sometimes criticized as being authoritarian.</p>
         
         <p>The prospective new EU Constitution was subject to debate in the first half of 2005. The government declared that it would not subject the Constitutional Treaty to a referendum. Instead, the plan was to ratify the Treaty through a decision by parliament. This was heavily criticized by the government's Left and Green cooperation parties. The matter could have led to a crisis in the cooperation pact, and it probably came as a relief to the government when the entire ratification process was halted following rejections of the treaty in referenda in France and the Netherlands. The Swedish government, as well as the opposition, remain in principle positive to the Constitution, but its future will be determined by developments in the EU as a whole.</p>
         
         <p>The EU‐critical June List, which made a spectacular breakthrough in the 2004 election to the European Parliament, initially indicated that it does not plan to run in parliamentary elections. It then stated that it might reconsider this position if the EU Constitution is not subjected to a referendum. Despite the issue at least temporarily being removed from the immediate agenda, the June List announced in October that it intends to participate in the parliamentary election of 2006. Other new parties also declared their intentions to run in the 2006 election. The Feminist Initiative has former Left Party leader Gudrun Schyman as one of its leading names. The Health Care Party is based on a number of regional health care parties, some of which have already made some impact in their respective areas. Opinion polls initially suggested that the June List may have a chance to pass the 4 per cent threshold for parliamentary representation, although support for the party appeared to decline towards the end of the year. Support for the Feminist Initiative and the Health Care Party appeared to be minimal.</p>
         
         <p>The main budget, presented to parliament on 20 September, was agreed after tough negotiations. The main stumbling block was asylum policy. The background was that there was a backlog of about 10,000 unresolved asylum applications, and reports of asylum seekers who suffer psychologically while waiting for the verdict, some going into hiding. At the same time, the Aliens Appeals Board was due to be abolished, with the processing of appeals moved to selected regional administrative courts. Against this background, the Left and Green parties demanded an amnesty for all current asylum seekers in the country so that the new appeals system could start from scratch. The government was opposed, and a proposal of a general asylum amnesty was rejected by parliament on 14 September. The Left Party decided to back down, but the Greens stood firm until the night before the budget was due to be presented. In the end a compromise was reached, according to which all asylum‐seeking families in hiding would have their applications re‐processed according to partially redefined criteria that included the amount of time they have been in Sweden, the social situation of their children and their general integration into Swedish society.</p>
         
         <p>The budget was regarded as expansionist and influenced by the fact that an election was due in 12 months. It included an employment package with the ambition to get 55,000 people onto the labour market in two years, and more money to families with children, foreign aid, higher education and local and regional governments. The ‘Green tax shift’– a concession to the Green Party – continued with higher taxes on energy, aviation, waste and fuel, in exchange for lower income tax for those with low and medium incomes and a reduction in charges for single person businesses. The opposition, which presented a joint alternative budget proposal in October, criticized the government for failing to bring unemployment down and for a lack of fiscal prudence. Some commentators warned that the government's surplus target of 2 per cent of GDP over the economic cycle was in danger. The average between 2000 and 2005 was given in the budget as 1.6 per cent, and the government envisaged fairly substantial loans in the near future. According to figures published in January 2006 by the National Debt Office, there was a fiscal surplus for 2005 amounting to SEK13 billion (approx. €1.4 billion) – the first surplus since 2002. The national debt, however, grew by SEK52 billion (€5.8 billion) to SEK1.309 billion (€145 billion), but declined relative to GDP by one percentage point to 49 per cent. The growth rate of calendar‐adjusted GDP went down from 3.0 per cent in 2004 to 2.7 per cent in 2005 according to a report published in March 2006 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER), but an increase was projected for 2006.</p>
         
         <p>The main problem for the government was unemployment. Despite a fairly strong economy, the government has been forced to concede its target of 80 per cent of the workforce aged between 20 and 64 being in employment. According to NIER, the proportion was 77.2 per cent for 2005. According to statistics from the Swedish National Labour Market Administration, the annual average unemployment for 2005 was 5.3 per cent of the workforce. A further 2.7 per cent were involved in labour market schemes, which meant a total unemployment rate of 8 per cent. Due to a change in calculation criteria, these figures are not directly comparable to earlier years, but they do not represent the decline the government had hoped for. Inflation continued to stay below the central bank Riksbanken's target of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12‐month changes in the Consumer Price Index) fluctuated between 0.0 and 0.9 per cent in 2005.</p>
