         <p>The Swiss People's Party (SVP) again emerged victorious from the federal elections. Though it could not celebrate a landslide victory as it did in 2003, the SVP was still able to increase its share from an already high level of 26.7 per cent to 28.9 per cent. This marks the best election result for any of the four governing parties since the introduction of proportional representation in 1919. It meant that the SVP managed to gain seats not only in their traditional strongholds, but also in the French‐speaking part of Switzerland and in the predominantly rural and Catholic regions of central Switzerland, where the SVP has only recently established cantonal sections.</p>
         
         <p>Electoral support for the Social Democratic Party (SPS), however, eroded – in some cantons quite dramatically. In the most populous canton of Zurich, for example, the SPS lost three seats. The main beneficiaries of the Social Democrats' electoral losses were the Green and the Green Liberal parties. Whereas the Green Party had its best showing ever (9.6 per cent of the popular vote), the Green Liberal Party (a splinter group of the Zurich Green Party and founded only months before the general elections) gained three seats in the National Council and one in the Council of States (Ständerat).</p>
         
         <p>The other big losers of the 2007 elections were the Radicals (the Free Democratic Party, FDP): their vote share dropped from 17.3 per cent to an all‐time low of 15.8 percent. This marked the seventh consecutive election the FDP had to accept an electoral loss. The Christian Democrats (CVP), however, were able to stop their own ongoing downward slide by recording a (very) slight gain of 0.1 per cent of the popular vote.</p>
         
         <p>Analysis of voting behaviour indicates that the voters shifted <i>from one party to another</i>. However, there have not been major shifts <i>between the ideological blocs</i>. The losses of the SPS have been compensated more or less by the gains of the left‐wing Greens and, to a certain extent, of the centrist Green Liberals. Likewise, a considerable part of the small right‐wing parties' voters as well as some of the FDP followers swung to the SVP this time. Overall, therefore, inter‐bloc volatility was low and hence the ideological composition of the Swiss parliament remains by and large the same.

         <p>The 2007 electoral campaign reached record levels of campaign expenditure and was strongly personalised, which is atypical for Switzerland. The predominant campaign issue was a controversy about an alleged plot against Justice Minister Christoph Blocher of the SVP. Tellingly, the SVP's advertising campaign focused mainly on its leader and promised that, by voting for the SVP, people would strengthen Blocher. Another SVP poster – depicting three white sheep kicking a black sheep away from the Swiss flag – even made it to the front page of international newspapers and provoked criticism around the globe for being xenophobic.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the highly confrontational election campaign, the turnout was only slightly above‐average at 48.9 per cent.</p>

         <p>The Federal Council elections on 12 December 2007 were historical in many ways. After Ruth Metzler (CVP) was forced out of office by Christoph Blocher in 2003 – marking the first time in 130 years that a serving minister was not re‐elected – the same happened to Blocher in 2007. After just one term in office, he lost his seat to fellow party member Eveline Widmer‐Schlumpf from the canton of Grisons. The Grisons finance director (not an official party nominee for the government elections) holds a more liberal and moderate party line than her colleague Christoph Blocher. She was supported by the Social Democrats, the Greens, most of the Christian Democrats and some Radicals, but not by her own party, the SVP. Subsequently, the SVP, which in the run‐up to the elections threatened to leave the government if Blocher were not re‐elected, went into opposition, feeling that it was no longer represented by its two federal councillors. Eveline Widmer‐Schlumpf has since been criticised heavily by her own party for accepting her election. She and Samuel Schmid (SVP) have been excluded from the fraction's group meetings and, most recently, in an unprecedented move, delegates of the SVP called on Widmer‐Schlumpf to step down or be expelled from the party. She has rejected those demands.</p>
         
         <p>All other federal councillors were re‐elected. Pascal Couchepin (FDP) was appointed President of the Swiss Federation for 2008. Corina Casanova was elected the new Federal Chancellor.</p>

         <p>Only two ballots were held in 2007. On the first ballot, on 11 March, the Swiss people had to decide on the initiative ‘for a social and unified health insurance fund’. The proposal was launched by a left‐wing movement and was backed by the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party and the trade unions. It called for a radical system change in health insurance. In Switzerland, health insurance is organised by mutual aid societies, both public and private. Basic sickness insurance is compulsory. However, one is free to choose among a considerable number of recognised healthcare providers. Actually, there are 87 different private insurance companies in the Swiss health insurance market. Health insurance premiums are not dependent on income level. However, premiums for low‐income individuals are subsidised. The initiative's aim was to end this competition between the private mutuals, and to establish <i>one</i> compulsory, national health insurance fund instead. Furthermore, the initiative called for premiums to be indexed to an individual's economic capacity. The proposal was turned down by an overwhelming majority of 71.2 per cent of the voters and by 24 of 26 cantons. Once again, an initiative aiming to change Switzerland's healthcare system failed. Only four years ago, a similar initiative by the Social Democratic Party was blocked by an almost identical proportion of Swiss voters.
         </p>
         
         <p>The post‐vote VOX analysis revealed that the voters were utterly confused about who was to pay how much for health insurance. Both the supporters as well as the opponents of the initiative offered calculations on who was to pay how much if the proposal were accepted. Not surprisingly, these figures contradicted each other and thus contributed more to confusion than to a clarification as far as voters were concerned. If voters are unsure about how to vote, more often than not they opt for the status quo. Hence, even the followers of the SPS and the Green Party, whose parties were both supporting the initiative, did not unanimously say ‘yes’ to the proposal: only slightly over 50 per cent voted for it. In contrast, the supporters of the centre and right‐wing parties overwhelmingly followed their parties' recommendations.</p>
         
         <p>The June 2007 ballot again asked only one (legislative) question and again it was a social security measure on which the Swiss people had to decide. This time, the fifth revision of the Federal Law on Invalidity Insurance (IV) was put to a vote. The new law set aside a debt‐relief of the deeply indebted IV by enacting massive expenditure cuts. These cuts would mainly be attained by austerity measures (abolition of permanent supplementary benefits for spouses, no further career allowances, etc.). Moreover, the revision of the law aimed at better re‐integration of sick people into the job market. The revision's supporters argued that by doing this, the number of claimants would drop significantly. The bill was backed by the centre and right‐wing parties, but was opposed by the left parties and most of the associations representing the disabled. The latter argued that the cost‐cutting measures would go too far and that the IV could not be financially secured by benefit cuts only, but also needed also some extra revenues (namely, a VAT increase).</p>
         
         <p>The ballot preceded a hotly debated and controversial discussion about what the SVP called the ‘quasi‐disabled’ (<i>Scheininvalide</i>). Using this catchword, the national conservative SVP decried alleged abuse of the IV. Analysis of the voting behaviour showed that, although there were no assured facts about the frequency of abuse, the law was primarily associated with the battle against it. Moreover, as survey data shows, a clear‐cut majority (64 per cent) of the Swiss believe there are too many ‘quasi‐disabled’ (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic 2007</a></span>). Hence the bill, which has been linked by the voters with tougher screening and stricter examinations, passed the referendum hurdle with of 59.1 per cent voting ‘yes’.
