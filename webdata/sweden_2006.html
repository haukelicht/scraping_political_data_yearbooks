         <p>The year 2007 in Swedish politics did not contain any elections or other major events. Nevertheless, it can hardly be called uneventful. After its historic election victory in 2006, the new Alliance Government had a difficult first full year in office. There was one ministerial resignation, in rather acrimonious circumstances, and several casualties among government officials below ministerial level. There were leadership changes in two parties.</p>
         
         <p>The new government was at pains to carry out the reform programme on which it had won the election. However, many of the reforms did not go down well with the public. The replacement of the much criticised property tax with a local property charge, and increased tax on profits from the selling of property, were claimed to have a negative effect for many house owners. Cuts in, and stricter rules for, unemployment and sickness benefits were criticised as attacks on the weak. There was also criticism of Reinfeldt's low‐key leadership style. The Government's popularity, which had already started to decline in 2006, plummeted in 2007, and the Social Democratic‐Left Party‐Green Party opposition bloc took a clear lead in the opinion polls.</p>
         
         <p>The most serious setback for the Government was the resignation of Defence Minister Mikael Odenberg on 5 September. Odenberg reacted against defence cuts envisaged by Minister of Finance Anders Borg, claiming that the Defence Ministry was finding it difficult to fulfil its tasks with spending cuts that had already been agreed, and that he was not prepared to implement further reductions. When the dispute first emerged, in July, it looked as if it might be possible to reconcile the differences, but when Odenberg later discovered that the cuts, without his consent, had been included in the draft Finance plan (a key economic policy document presented together with the budget), he resigned. He made no secret of the disagreements, and the public fallout brought much negative publicity. Odenberg continued to criticise the Government's defence policy after his departure.</p>
         
         <p>Almost immediately, 41 year‐old Minister for Trade Sten Tolgfors was announced as the new Minister of Defence. Tolgfors had joined the Government in October 2006 as a replacement for the short‐lived Maria Borelius (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2007</a></span>: 1125). Unlike Odenberg, Tolgfors does not have a military background; indeed, he did his National Service with the Red Cross (conscientious dissenters may opt for ‘weapon‐free service’). The vacant place as Minister for Trade was taken by the 46 year‐old Ewa Björling. An accomplished researcher in virology, Björling was a relative newcomer to politics, having become an MP in 2002. The changes did not affect the party composition of the Government, but the gender balance shifted from 13 men and 9 women to 12:10. The average age went down slightly, but had risen to 47.6 years by the end of 2007.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government also suffered other embarrassing moments. In October, Prime Minister Reinfeldt's close aide Ulrika Schenström was caught on camera in a tender situation with a television journalist in a restaurant. Schenström was not a member of the cabinet, but centrally placed in the Government organisation, immediately below ministerial level. Her responsibilities included media contacts and national security, and the latter was the main problem. It was questioned whether Schenström had been intoxicated while on duty for the Government security organisation when the picture was taken. The security organisation, whose task is to initiate a response to national emergencies, is politically very important following the heavy criticism of the inadequate Government response to the Tsunami disaster in 2004 (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2006</a></span>: 1271). Trusting Schenström's own version, Reinfeldt first categorically denied that she had been intoxicated, but when the restaurant bill was revealed and showed that considerable amounts of alcohol had been purchased, he was forced to sack her.
         </p>
         
         <p>A few weeks before the Schenström affair, Mats Odell, Christian Democratic Minister for Local Government and Finance Markets, was in a difficult situation. Odell is in charge of the process of selling government‐owned companies. To help him, he recruited consultants from the investment bank Carnegie. Soon, however, it was reported that employees of Carnegie were subject to investigation for alleged insider deals. In late September, the Financial Supervisory Authority issued a report containing severe criticism of Carnegie. The government aides from Carnegie claimed not to have been involved in any wrongdoing, but their background in the discredited bank made their positions untenable. They were forced to resign, and the cooperation with Carnegie ended, on the bank's own request. Odell's position was questioned, but he survived. The Government remained committed to the sales process.</p>
         
         <p>One of the governing parties, the People's Party Liberals, changed leader. Lars Leijonborg, in charge since 1997, was partly blamed for his party's disappointing performance in the 2006 election, and in spring 2007 he was forced to concede that he no longer had enough support to stay in his position. Leijonborg had not been implicated directly in the ‘Intrusion Affair’ of the 2006 election campaign (illicit entry into the Social Democratic Intranet; see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2007</a></span>: 1122). Some commentators linked the affair to an organisational culture that had developed under Leijonborg's leadership, although it was not the only, not even the major, reason for his downfall. It led to criminal charges against six persons, including one Social Democrat and one journalist: three were fined and three acquitted. It was more or less instantly clear that Leijonborg's successor would be the Minister for Schools, Jan Björklund. Unopposed, he formally took over at the party congress in early September. Unusually for departed party leaders, Leijonborg remained in the Government. Björklund took his place as head of the Ministry of Education, but both kept their respective policy portfolios.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Social Democratic Party also changed leader, at an extraordinary party congress on 17 March. Former Prime Minister Göran Persson, in charge since 1996, announced his resignation on the night of the 2006 election. At first the ensuing leadership race seemed open, but in early 2007 the 50 year‐old Mona Sahlin emerged as the only candidate. Sahlin is the seventh, and first female, leader of the Social Democrats since the party was formed in 1889. An experienced politician, she has held several cabinet posts since 1990, and was party secretary from 1992 to 1994. She came close to becoming leader in 1995, but was forced into a temporary ‘time out’ from politics after revelations of private use of a government credit card (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Pierre &amp; Widfeldt 1996</a></span>: 466). Ideologically Sahlin is regarded as on the centre‐right of her party, and there was some scepticism against her candidacy from trade union representatives, but she was elected unanimously.
         </p>
         
         <p>The economy slowed down, but essentially remained strong. According to figures published in January 2008 by the National Debt office, there was a fiscal surplus for 2007 amounting to SEK103 billion (approx. €11.4 billion); an increase of SEK85 billion compared to 2005. The national debt shrank by SEK102 billion (€11.3 billion) to SEK1,168 billion (€130 million), and declined relative to GDP by 6 percentage points to 39 per cent. The growth rate of calendar‐adjusted GDP went down from 4.4 per cent in 2006 to 2.7 per cent in 2007, according to a report published in March 2007 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER). The annual average unemployment for 2007 went down by one percentage point to 3.6 per cent of the workforce, according to statistics from the Swedish National Labour Market Administration. Another 1.9 per cent was involved in labour market schemes, which meant a total unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent: a decline of 2.1 percentage points. According to NIER, the employment rate among those aged 20–64 rose marginally to 79.4 per cent in 2007; the target level of 80 per cent set by the former Social Democratic Government was reached in early 2008. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12‐month changes in the Consumer Price Index) fluctuated between 1.7 and 2.0 per cent from January to August 2007, but rose towards the end of the year and reached 3.5 per cent in December. This was outside the target rate of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point, used by the central bank, the Riksbanken, since 1995. The Repo interest rate was 4.0 per cent at the end of the year, having been raised four times by Riksbanken.</p>
