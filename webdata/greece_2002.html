         <p>The trial of the ‘17 November’ terrorist group opened in early March 2003 amid great excitement, which, in the absence of novel revelations, soon subsided. After nine months of proceedings (and the examination of nearly 500 witnesses), 15 defendants were sentenced in early December for their participation in several assassinations, attempted assassinations and other terrorist attacks. Four were acquitted, including the only woman.</p>
         
         <p>On 16 April, the ceremony for the accession of 10 new European Union (EU) members was held in Athens, and marked the apex of the Greek EU presidency. Nevertheless, this great moment for the Simitis Government was marred by allegations of improper ties to businessmen, which led to the summary dismissal of one vice‐minister. In June, the celebration of the EU summit in Greece was again marred by scandal. On 18 June, two Simitis cronies (Minister of State S. Manikas and M. Neonakis, member of PASOK's Executive Bureau) were forced to resign after the revelation that they had played with inexplicably exorbitant sums in the stock market during its artificial boom, back in 1999. This was an obvious affront to the mass of losers, who had then trusted the Government (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2000</i>: 316).
         </p>
         
         <p>Simitis was visibly exasperated by the contrast between his successes abroad and the domestic image of his Government. As soon as the Greek presidency was over, he took the initiative. On 2 July, he forced the resignation of party secretary K. Laliotis and of the entire Executive Bureau. Laliotis attributed his sacking to American pressure. Others attributed it to his surreptitious orchestration of press attacks against Simitis cronies. In effect, his resignation represented for Simitis the removal of a competing authority and of the most formidable spokesman of PASOK's Old Guard. With respect to the others, Simitis invoked the requirements of a victorious electoral campaign in 2004, and advanced the view that, at this time, membership in the party executive was incompatible with a government post. On 3 July, a subdued Central Committee heard two long speeches by Simitis and Laliotis. Only the first was broadcast by state television. Simitis’ choice for party secretary, M. Chrysochoidis (hitherto Minister of Public Order), was elected by a two‐thirds majority. Similarly, Simitis had his choice of eight members elected to the new executive, leaving the remaining three seats to the Tsochatzopoulos faction. Those elected were mostly younger. The anomalous continuing participation in the party executive of A. Kaklamanis, Speaker of Parliament, raised no objection.</p>
         
         <p>On 4 July, the long‐awaited cabinet reshuffle proved an anticlimax, to the disappointment of PASOK supporters and the relief of ND. It involved only four ministers plus six vice‐ministers, including two ‘converts’, one from the right (V. Kontogiannopoulos) and one from the left (N. Bistis). Some dismissals appeared wholly unjustified, creating bitterness.</p>
         
         <p>A plausible overall interpretation of the changes imposed by Simitis in July was that his firm and unchallenged control of the party also paved the way to his eventual succession by George A. Papandreou. Potential contenders were effectively forced out of the party leadership and trapped in a government that was bound to go down in electoral defeat. Simitis also attempted to regain the initiative <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the opposition parties by proposing bold measures for the disclosure of personal assets and for a complete overhaul of the electoral system. He was far more successful in gaining the upper ground in early September. A comprehensive and well thought‐out policy package offered something to practically everyone, including even the Church and the industrialists. Nonetheless, the impression created (to the dismay of ND) was to prove short‐lived.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>In November, Greek public opinion was absorbed by a bitter feud between the Orthodox Church of Greece and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople over their respective jurisdictions. All political parties wisely refrained from taking sides openly. The year ended amid expectations that Simitis would step aside to the benefit of G. Papandreou.</p>
