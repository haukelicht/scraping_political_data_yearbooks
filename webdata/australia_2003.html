         <p>As with last year, this article considers the events during the year in their order of importance as assessed by me. However, first let it be noted that there were certain characteristics that were identical between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2005. The Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party during this period remained John Howard. Nor did the leaders of the Labor Party (Mark Latham), the National Party (John Anderson) and the Greens (Senator Bob Brown) change. The only difference in party leadership was related to the Democrats who performed dismally at the 2004 election. On 1 January 2004 their leader was Senator Andrew Bartlett, while on 1 January 2005 their leader was Senator Lyn Allison. However, see the section entitled ‘The leadership of Mark Latham’ below.</p>
         
         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss2"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss2-title"> The invasion of Iraq</h3>
            
            <p>There would be little dispute that the American‐led invasion of Iraq was the most important issue in Australia as elsewhere. However, the Australian situation was unusual because the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ consisted of only six countries: the four joining the invasion and contributing troops, and the two countries adjoining Iraq (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) from whose territory the invasion was actually launched. The United States contributed the most troops, followed by, in order, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland.</p>
            
            <p>The Australian contribution was only 2,000 troops, and not a single casualty was suffered in 2003 or in 2004. By the beginning of 2004, Iraq was well and truly over for Australia. It had joined ‘the hard part’ (actually the easy part – namely, the invasion itself) and withdrawn most of its troops by the middle of 2003. Only 900 were left in or near Iraq, of which only 450 were actually in Iraq itself. Consequently, public opinion shifted greatly. Australia had, in Howard's words, ‘moved on’ and commentators were left wondering how it could be that George Bush and Tony Blair were still in controversy over Iraq while Howard had escaped with almost no apparent loss of face. In short, Australia had enjoyed a jolly good war in Iraq, something which could not be said of the United States, Britain or Poland.</p>
            
            <p>On Monday, 31 January 2005 Australia suffered its first military death in the Iraq war. A British C‐130 Hercules transport plane was shot down by insurgents north of Baghdad, killing ten troops. Of the ten, nine were British and one an Australian – Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel, a navigator temporarily serving with Britain's Royal Air Force. The day of his death chanced to be the one following the Iraqi general election and was the 685th day of the American–British occupation.</p>
            
            <p>On 22 February 2005, Howard announced that another 450 Australian troops would be sent to Iraq, meaning that Australia would double the number of its ground troops. The troops would be sent to the southern province of Al Muthanna to protect 550 unarmed Japanese army engineers based at Samawah on the Euphrates. Under the Japanese postwar (1947) constitution, their overseas forces could only operate in non‐combat zones and be involved in humanitarian and reconstruction activities. Consequently they needed protection. That task had been performed by Dutch forces, but the Netherlands was withdrawing from Iraq so the Japanese requested that some other country replace the Dutch forces. After several other countries refused, Australia volunteered for the task, which was effective from April 2005. Howard noted that only two Dutch soldiers had been killed in Al Muthanna Province which, being overwhelmingly Shi’ite, is one of the safest in the country. He argued that the Japanese engineers would be compelled to withdraw entirely if no protection were offered. The area in question is part of the British Zone and direct personal requests were made by Tony Blair and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. ‘The Japanese presence in Iraq as part of the coalition operation, albeit of a humanitarian kind, is a very important one and if it were to have disappeared then I think that would both in substance and in symbolism be a very bad thing,’ Howard said.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> The leadership of Mark Latham</h3>
            
            <p>Commentators were very much ‘taken in’ by Mark Latham who was Labor leader and Leader of the Opposition throughout the whole of 2004. He is young, born in 1961 compared to Howard who was born in 1939. In 2004 Latham enjoyed a number of tactical parliamentary victories over Howard that seemed important enough at the time, but look trivial in retrospect. On 2 December 2003, Latham became party leader when he received 47 votes in the caucus ballot as opposed to 45 for Kim Beazley, who was attempting to make a comeback. It is interesting to see how this event relates to the invasion of Iraq.</p>
            
            <p>During the Iraq parliamentary debate in February–March 2003, Latham was vehement in his denunciation of George Bush and of John Howard's relationship to the American President. He described Howard as an ‘arse‐licker’ to Bush. Politicians in the Liberal and National parties, he said, were a ‘conga line of suckholes’. George Bush was ‘dangerous and flaky’ and ‘the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory’. This kind of talk was all very well coming from ‘any old’ Labor member (as Latham then was) but he made the mistake of refusing to back‐track when he became leader. Consequently, in March 2004, in the wake of the Spanish general election result, Latham promised that an Australian Labor government would withdraw all remaining Australian forces from Iraq ‘by Christmas’. What is extraordinary about this is that so few commentators saw it to be the blunder it was. Certainly Howard and his supporters described it as a policy of ‘cut and run’, but most commentators seemed to think that if the Spaniards could ‘cut and run’ so could the Australians. This was a grave misjudgment. Spaniards do not depend upon the American alliance – and nor do the French or Germans. By contrast, most Australians think the country very much depends on the American alliance.</p>
            
            <p>When the Australian general election was over, there was much debate among analysts as to its meaning. Was it a triumph for John Howard or was it a rejection of Mark Latham? If the latter, did the result prove Latham to be unelectable? The view of several commentators (including myself) was that the election result constituted primarily a rejection of Latham who, to quote my own words, had been ‘obviously a disaster’. It is truly surprising that the Labor leadership should have been a matter for debate. The history of it is that Beazley, having lost two elections (in October 1998 and November 2001), retired from the leadership. From November 2001 to November 2003, the Labor leader was Simon Crean, who was so hopeless that he was forced to stand down. It would have been in Labor's interest if Beazley had been re‐instated unopposed. However, Beazley alienated some caucus members by challenging Crean in June 2003, which allowed Latham to make his run. He would have been wiser to wait. The consequence is that Beazley will (almost certainly) be the Leader of the Opposition again for the next election which will be held in the second half of 2007.</p>
            
            <p>That commentators over‐estimated Latham is beyond dispute. To quote merely one example, writing in the <i>Australian Financial Review</i> on polling day itself, <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Geoffrey Barker</a></span> expressed this opinion:
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Win or lose, Mark Latham is the future of political Labor. A win will cement his place in Labor history as the man who crashed through to end the long Howard government incumbency. A loss will be judged an impressive first tilt at high office yet to be attained. . . . There is a broad consensus that Latham, however he is viewed, has won the campaign with a nice blend of toughness . . . tenderness . . . and wry humour.

                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>That is what many thought on polling day – until the counting of votes began. However, the election result was so bad for Latham that further thinking was required. What no one foresaw was how quickly Latham would destroy himself. He had, in fact, long suffered from poor health, but such a consideration was not mentioned when he sought the leadership.</p>
            
            <p>Just before Christmas, he went into hospital, suffering from pancreatitis. However, he pretended he was going on holiday and made his deputy, Jenny Macklin, acting leader. In normal circumstances that would not have mattered. However, when the Boxing Day tsunamis struck, it was expected that Latham would take some kind of lead. When he failed to do so people started to wonder where he was. When it turned out that he was in hospital, the party and the public started to wonder whether such an invalid (whose instinct was to conceal his invalidity) should be a political leader. Under considerable pressure, Latham announced on 18 January 2005 that he would resign as leader and from his seat in the House of Representatives. He cited ill‐health as the grounds for his resignation. On 28 January 2005, Beazley was elected leader by the caucus. He was unopposed. On Saturday, 19 March 2005, the Labor candidate, Chris Hayes, easily retained Latham's seat of Werriwa, in Sydney's southwestern suburbs.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> The October General Election</h3>
            
            <p>Due to the fact that the United States and Australia were part of the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ and the coincidence of their election dates, there was much debate in Australia as to whether George Walker Bush had a better chance to win a second term or John Winston Howard had a better chance to win a fourth term. In the end both men won, but Howard enjoyed far stronger support for his fourth term than did Bush for his second term.</p>
            
            <p>The atmosphere in Australia was very strange. Prior to polling day, pundits would assess the election as being ‘desperately close’– and this view was supported by most opinion polls. If he won at all, Howard would see his majority reduced in the House of Representatives. He had no chance to win a majority in the Senate. To varying degrees everyone seemed to over‐estimate Latham and under‐estimate Howard. In the event, the Howard Government increased its majority in the House of Representatives, an outcome predicted by no one, though some have claimed to have made such a prediction in private conversation! Indeed it was an outcome not even seriously suggested in print by anyone. In 2004, Labor won five seats fewer than in 2001, now having 60 seats compared to 65 following the 2001 election. Labor lost nine seats to the Coalition (all to the Liberal Party) and gained four, of which three were taken from the Liberal Party and one from the National Party. The Howard Government also won a majority in the Senate, registering a gain of four seats. This too was an outcome predicted by no one. Indeed I was the only pundit seriously to speculate upon such a possibility. While I actually predicted 38 Coalition senators from July 2005 (or half the Senate), the number turned out to be 39.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss5"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss5-title"> Howard and the Senate</h3>
            
            <p>The most significant feature of the election result is the Coalition majority in the Senate. Although the term ‘control freak’ is not widely used in Australia, this is what Howard is. For that reason (although he would not admit it), he expressed great frustration during his first three terms (1996–1998, 1998–2001 and 2001–2004). His lack of a Senate majority meant that not everything would be done his way. Furthermore, the non‐Coalition majority in the Senate could set up embarrassing enquiries into aspects of Howard policy and behaviour – quite apart from rejecting legislation it did not like.</p>
            
            <p>The best recent example of an embarrassing Senate enquiry was in 2002. In October 2001, HMAS <i>Adelaide</i>, on border patrol duties in the Indian Ocean, intercepted a boatload of ‘suspected illegal aliens’. It was subsequently claimed by the government, in the midst of the November 2001 election campaign, that these ‘suspected illegal aliens’ had threatened to throw their children into the water if the Navy did not take them on board. In 2003, the report of the Senate enquiry found that this did not happen. To be blunt, Australian ministers lied about the ‘children overboard’ threat in order to demonise asylum seekers who arrive by boat.
            </p>
            
            <p>During Howard's last term (2001–2004), the Senate rejected seven government pieces of legislation. These dealt with social security reform, unfair dismissals, border protection and privatisation of telecommunications. In addition, the government was compelled to negotiate with key senators on a package relating to medicare and another relating to the financing of universities.</p>
            
            <p>Section 57 of the Australian Constitution specifies how to deal with disagreements between the houses. Prime Ministers dislike Section 57 – essentially because it is based upon the idea that the Senate should be quite powerful. In a speech in June 2003 to a Liberal Party national convention in Adelaide, Howard said:</p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>We all know from our learning of Australian history that the Senate was essentially given its powers as a result of the federal compact between the various states of Australia at the time of Federation. The ideal was that it would be a state's house as well as a house of review. The reality is that long years ago the federal Senate ceased to be a state's house and in more recent times it has certainly also dropped the pretence of being a house of review. Tragically for Australia, through the instrument of the Labor Party and the minor parties, the Australian Senate in recent years, so far from being a state's house or a house of review, has become a house of obstruction. . . . The deadlock provisions of the Constitution in Section 57 were inserted way back at the time of Federation. And they contemplated the holding of a joint sitting after a double dissolution election in order to resolve deadlocks between the two houses. The reality is that in a period of 102 years they have only been able to produce a joint sitting on one occasion and that was in 1974. . . . A bipartisan committee in 1959 recommended that the Constitution should be altered by referendum to provide that if legislation were rejected on a number of occasions by the Senate in the way described in Section 57, there could be a joint sitting of the two houses called without the necessity to hold a double dissolution election: and that if the legislation were passed through that joint sitting, then it would become law. I think that could offer some years into the future a way of providing a more modern and contemporary and workable method of resolving differences between the two houses.</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>The Howard government then published an official paper entitled <span title=""><a href="#b3%20#b4" id="#b3 #b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Resolving Deadlocks</i></a></span>, which was 60 pages of ‘rubbish’ and quickly seen to be so. However, that was not the point: essentially Howard wanted a majority in the Senate. Party discipline is so strong in Australia that a Senate majority for a government is almost as good as abolishing the upper house. The Australian Senate has many admirers, both in Australia and overseas. However, the admiration is based upon the assumption that the government does not have a majority there. That admiration will return when Australia next has a government lacking a Senate majority: the checks and balances will then be restored. Clearly the new Senate will pass all the bills rejected in the last term. However, it will do more than that – a significant amount of the kind of legislative change recently implemented by President Bush in the United States will find its way through the Australian federal parliament as well.
            </p>
            
            <p>The three long‐serving Prime Ministers from the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies (December 1949 to January 1966), Malcolm Fraser (November 1975 to March 1983) and John Howard (March 1996 to the present day) have all enjoyed a Senate majority for only part of their term. There is a difference, however. Menzies and Fraser would explicitly ask for a Senate vote. By contrast, Howard knew that such a request would meet rejection. Too many people valued the checks and balances given by the Senate. His strategy, therefore, was to get a Senate majority by stealth, persuading all the commentators that a Senate majority is well‐nigh impossible. The consequence would be that people would give very little thought to their Senate vote, and then rely on the semi‐proportional nature of the system to get a majority of Senate seats without a majority of Senate votes.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss6"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss6-title"> The Australian States and Territories</h3>
            
            <p>The year 2002 witnessed the end of a process that has been going on for some years. It is now the case that all six State Premiers and both Territory Chief Ministers are from the Labor Party – the party which constitutes the federal Opposition. The year 2004 saw two of these governments face the people. There was a general election in Queensland in February and Labor won 63 of the 89 seats in the unicameral parliament, down only three from the number (66 out of 89) the party had won three years earlier. Commentators were struck by the large number of people who voted for John Howard's Liberal Party at the federal level and then voted for Peter Beattie's Labor Party at the state election. On Saturday 16 October (one week after the federal election), there was an election for the 17‐member unicameral parliament of the Australian Capital Territory. It saw the Labor government of Chief Minister Jon Stanhope re‐elected with nine seats, up one from the eight seats Labor had won at the previous election.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss7"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss7-title"> United States–Australia Free Trade Agreement</h3>
            
            <p>After 18 months of intense negotiations, it was announced in July that a so‐called ‘free‐trade agreement’ had been reached between the United States and Australia. The agreement essentially involved tariff reductions (over a lengthy period) between the two countries. Australian film and television producers were angry and Australian sugar growers were very disappointed. Otherwise there was agreement among commentators that Australia had done very well for itself. Legislation to implement the agreement passed easily through both houses of the American Congress and both houses of the Australian Parliament, and the agreement came into force on 1 January 2005.</p>
            
            <p>In the section above entitled ‘The invasion of Iraq’, I stated that ‘Australia had enjoyed a jolly good war in Iraq’. Apart from the factors I mentioned under that heading, I should add that the willingness of Australia to support Bush on the war was widely seen as a reason why Australia had been able to negotiate such a good trade deal. Indeed, the very few American senators and representatives who opposed the deal made it clear that part of their reasoning was that they did not think it appropriate that Australia should be rewarded for such a reason.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss8"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss8-title"> Boxing Day tsunamis</h3>
            
            <p>On Boxing Day 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunamis occurred, killing 296,000 people, of whom 237,000 (80 per cent) were in Indonesia. There was a political significance to this within Australia. Howard rapidly gained the reputation of being the only world leader with his eye on the ball. More quickly than any other leader he realised the magnitude of the disaster. Australia won the generosity competition at every stage. Consequently, in January 2005, the following statistics were published in the media of generous countries in the field of pledged tsunami relief. In US dollars, the biggest sum was from Australia at $815 million or 0.142 per cent of GDP. Coming in second was Germany at $674 million or 0.029 per cent of GDP. In third place was Japan at $500 million or 0.014 per cent of GDP. In a very poor fourth place was the United States at $350 million or 0.003 per cent of GDP. In fifth place was Canada at $345 million or 0.025 per cent of GDP. In a highly respectable sixth place was Norway at $183 million or 0.107 per cent of GDP. In other words, in terms of the absolute amount, Australia came first with Germany in second place. In terms of contribution as a percentage of GDP, Australia came first with Norway in second place.</p>
