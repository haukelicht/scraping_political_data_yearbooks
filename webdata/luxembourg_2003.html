         <p>Following the 2004 elections, the Effective Number of Parties based on seats dropped from 4.3 to 3.8. With half of the voting power as calculated by the standardized <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Banzhaf (1965</a></span>) index,<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> the CSV had its power strongly enhanced while that of the ADR has completely disappeared in comparison to 1999. The Effective Number of Relevant Parties (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; Caulier 2003</a></span>) accordingly decreased from 3.75 to 3.<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a> The Maximum Contribution Index (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Caulier 2004</a></span>) has a value of 2 (it was 2.6 in 1999), indicating that taken together, the other parties represented in the Chamber have the same voting power as the CSV on its own.<a href="#en3" class="scrollableLink"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
         
         <p>The 1999–2004 legislative term was characterised by a number of issues that may well have had an impact on the outcome of June 2004 elections. First, a bill for a new status for civil servants was voted upon. Civil servants represent almost 40 per cent of all voters, and in 1999 the Liberals in opposition had gained many votes from this large sector of the voting population. With this sensitive issue settled by the government, much of the discontent among civil servants disappeared and votes that had migrated to the DP in 1999 were expected to be distributed more evenly among the parties. Second, a pension reform (‘<i>rentendesch</i>’) was introduced, consisting of a scheme between the public and private sectors that was more balanced in favour of the latter. Hence, much of the appeal of the ‘pensioners’ party’ ADR was lowered, as the main theme of its political programme was implemented by the incumbent government.
         </p>
         
         <p>Third, the outgoing government pleaded for the preservation of banking secrecy laws in Luxembourg and for the adoption by its international competitors (within and outside the European Union, e.g., Switzerland or Channel Islands) of similar measures so as to prevent Luxembourg from losing any of its competitiveness as a financial centre. As the main figure of this victory in terms of preservation of national interests in the context of European harmonisation of national policies was the Prime Minister (also Finance Minister), the CSV and especially its leader were likely to do well at the polls. On the other hand, the Prime Minister also took risks during this term – for instance, when he declared in 2002 that he was in favour of granting dual nationality under certain conditions to residents working in Luxembourg (this question is very important because almost 41 per cent of the resident population of the Grand Duchy are foreigners and 85 per cent of them come from an EU Member State). Overall, he managed to cover a large range of opinions, from the struggle for national interests to a liberal view on the question of nationality, together with a general pro‐European commitment.</p>
         
         <p>Opinion polls published one year before the elections (ILRES‐Tageblatt) indicated that the DP would lose substantially, the ADR vote would also drop, and the winners would be the LSAP, the CSV and the Greens. Subsequent polls predicted large losses for the junior incumbent party, and an important victory for the party of the Prime Minister. Overall, these forecasts were confirmed on 13 June. The classic ‘most important issue’ question was asked in a series of opinion surveys performed by the University of Luxembourg between November 2003 and March 2004, and the three most cited issues were education, environment and unemployment. The bad results of Luxembourg in international surveys of education systems certainly influenced this ranking, as the press widely reported these dramatic results; this undermined the DP's electoral prospects, as they had campaigned on this theme in 1999, but this time were accountable for the performance of the education system, having been in charge of the Education Ministry from 1999 to 2004.<a href="#en4" class="scrollableLink"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
         
         <p>Popular concern over different forms of pollution also foreshadowed gains for the Greens. To the question ‘what will be the most determinant issue that will influence the results?’, respondents gave the answer ‘unemployment’ by far the most, followed by education and pensions, reflecting fears regarding the economic situation of the country.<a href="#en5" class="scrollableLink"><sup>5</sup></a> The salience of the unemployment issue, which may seem odd in the European context given the very low rates displayed by Luxembourg (below 3 per cent for a long time, it nevertheless rose tremendously in relative terms since the second half of 2002 and was higher than 4 per cent in 2004), was fuelled by the declaration of the steel industry group Arcelor, two months before the elections, that most of its production facilities in Luxembourg had to be restructured for competitive reasons. No less than 1,000 jobs were threatened in what is the main employer of the country (6,700 employees).<a href="#en6" class="scrollableLink"><sup>6</sup></a> This had a major impact on public opinion, especially in the south of the country, the historical cradle of Luxembourg's industry.
         </p>
         
         <p>The main political parties focused their campaign on national issues such as economic growth and unemployment, education and transport. The first of these three topics was high on the agenda (compared to 1999) because, for the first time after 15 years of uninterrupted economic growth (at levels between 3.5 and 5 per cent), 2003 witnessed a slowing down (to a growth rate around 2 per cent), particularly in the financial industry which guarantees almost 25 per cent of the State's revenue and because of the prospects of job losses in heavy industry (see above). The second was high on the agenda because of the traumatic result at the PISA survey mentioned earlier, and finally transport was important because of developments needed due to the strategic geographical position of Luxembourg in the heart of Europe, its attractiveness in terms of the labour market that leads commuters (no less than 100,000 people) to cross the border every day, and the importance of a regional plan<a href="#en7" class="scrollableLink"><sup>7</sup></a> that would also take into account both quality of life and respect for the environment. Moreover, the question of the privatisation of railway stations, in the context of the liberalisation of the railway sector imposed by the European Commission, set the DP apart from all other parties that opposed such a decision.
         </p>
         
         <p>The CSV, the party of the Prime Minister, based its campaign on security issues with the slogan ‘<i>De séchere Wee</i>’ (‘the safe way’). It meant less employment insecurity and the strengthening of social cohesion in an open economy, but could also be understood as a struggle against petty crime (the policy and discourse of Minister of Justice Frieden, at the right of the party, was aimed at containing the rightist and sovereigntist ADR's electoral success on issues of immigration and insecurity) and most of all as the ‘safe electoral choice’ given the experience of the party and its leader(s) in power.
         </p>
         
         <p>Campaign activities were highly centred on the personality of the Prime Minister as Jean‐Claude Juncker performed at dozens of meetings (‘Juncker on Tour’: the main series of events organised by the party during the campaign) with voters all over the country. These meetings drew considerable audiences compared to those organized by other parties. The DP, on the other hand, campaigned on the performance of the party and of the coalition as a whole in power. Their main slogan ‘<i>Kommt, mir maache weider</i>’ (‘Let's continue together’) referred clearly to their objective of carrying on governing, without any call for a change of partner. The party stressed its role in the reform of the civil service, especially in the maintenance of the current pension scheme and the prohibition for foreigners applying for the vast majority of public‐sector jobs (this was a specific claim of the <i>Confédération Générale de la Fonction Publique</i>, the trade union that was relatively close to the DP in this period), but also in the generous and audacious tax reforms for both citizens and companies, directly inspired by the British and American reforms introduced at the beginning of the 1990s. The DP also recalled that a bill was passed regarding the rights of non‐married couples, including homosexuals, due to the party's pressure on the CSV.
         </p>
         
         <p>In order to break the isolation of his party in the Luxembourg political system, François Bausch, the most prominent Green leader, started to transform the party into a centrist ecology formation. During the outgoing legislature, the Greens supported the government's liberal reforms both in economics and values. The party also adopted a new slogan during the last electoral campaign, ‘<i>Neit Kapital fir Lëtzebuerg</i>’ (‘A new capital for Luxembourg’), that was supposed to reconcile traditional ethical and social preoccupations with the promotion of the Luxembourg finance sector and libertarian values. During the campaign, the Greens criticised the transport policy (in particular, the extension of the international airport situated in the residential suburbs of Luxembourg City) and the education policy (for them, the Luxembourg educational system feeds the growth in inequalities between newcomers and Luxembourg teenagers) of the outgoing government.
         </p>
         
         <p>For the Socialist Party, the outgoing legislature in opposition was a period of reconstruction of its political identity. The national leadership of the party decided to go ‘back to basics’– that is, to the fundamental principals of social democracy – as in 1999 its traditional voters in the South not only went to the CSV, but also to the ADR. During the campaign, the party presented itself as the ‘left people's party’. They summarised their campaign with a triptych: defense of the Welfare State, a triangle of education‐family‐labour, and quality of life.</p>
         
         <p>The other two parties represented in the Chamber, which are situated at the extreme poles of the political spectrum, understandably had quite different campaigns: while the ADR attempted to widen the scope of issues with which it was identified (as it is only seen as the ‘pensions’ party by the electorate), the Left developed a campaign against the consequences of neo‐liberal policies and the behaviour of multinational companies (taking Arcelor as one of their main targets) in order to attract the bulk of extreme‐left voters despite the independent candidacy of the Communist Party.<a href="#en8" class="scrollableLink"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
         
         <p>Finally, an important topic imposed itself in both the national and European campaign:<a href="#en9" class="scrollableLink"><sup>9</sup></a> the potential appointment of Jean‐Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission. In April 2004, the Prime Minister officially declined the offer of the European People's Party and a majority of the European centre‐right governments. At home, however, the LSAP tried to orientate the national political debate on Juncker's alleged duplicity. Juncker's political future at the European level (see below) was also relevant to the national campaign as it raised the problem of his succession, with the outgoing Minister of Justice, Luc Frieden, representing the right wing of the party (liberal conservative) and François Biltgen, outgoing Minister of Labour and president of the Christian Social People's Party, embodying the left wing (trade unionist and social democrat) as potential successors.
         </p>
         
         <p>As the electoral system allows for inter‐party preferential votes, parties explicitly target specific categories of voters, although the CSV, LSAP and the Greens had recourse to external public opinion polls and the DP to focus groups in order to identify who might be their potential voters. The extreme‐left aimed at seducing the working class and young people, as their electorate was mainly composed of middle‐class left intellectuals. In terms of candidate selection, given Luxembourg's highly personalised electoral system, all parties seek to enlist notable candidates. As there are only six Luxembourg MEPs to be elected in a national constituency, all parties tend to place their heavyweights on their European list. Consequently, incumbent ministers, MPs, MEPs and mayors of the largest cities are candidates for both the national and European elections. In 2004, 70 of the 84 candidates (58 out of the 60 candidates for the five largest parties) running for a seat in the European Parliament (EP) were also candidates for the <i>Chambre des députés</i>. Although the 1994 EP elections (the first since the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty allowing for the candidacy of EU citizens in any Member State) all parties except the DP and the ADR included foreign candidates on their list, in 2004 only three (the Greens, The Left and the KPL) of the seven parties presented non‐Luxembourg candidates. Altogether the latter accounted for 12 per cent of the EP candidates. The main parties realised that non‐Luxembourg candidates have not yet been able to attract <i>panachage</i> votes in the single national constituency and, as a result, avoided such candidates in 2004.<a href="#en10" class="scrollableLink"><sup>10</sup></a> Well‐known candidates are clearly sought for national elections as well, parties tend either to encourage incumbent MPs (and ministers) to head constituency lists or at least these heavyweights, together with mayors of large cities,<a href="#en11" class="scrollableLink"><sup>11</sup></a> have an (informal) automatic right to run for election.<a href="#en12" class="scrollableLink"><sup>12</sup></a> Gender parity was self‐imposed for the composition of the lists of the Green Party and The Left, while the CSV requested that at least one‐third of their lists be of each gender. The Greens also guaranteed that at least a quarter of the candidates on their lists for the national elections were under 30 years of age.
         </p>
         
         <p>As voting is compulsory in the Grand Duchy, turnout is not much of an issue. In 2004 it was above 91 per cent of registered voters for both the national and European elections. As voters either reward or punish parties and candidates on national political grounds (because most of them are either ministers or national MPs), electoral results at the two levels are seldom contradictory.<a href="#en13" class="scrollableLink"><sup>13</sup></a> Since the 1970s, preferential voting (either intra‐ or inter‐party) has increased tremendously, from 31.3 per cent of the votes cast in 1979 to 46.6 per cent in 2004.<a href="#en14" class="scrollableLink"><sup>14</sup></a> By far the most frequent type of preferential ballots include votes for candidates of different lists: altogether in 2004, more than one‐third (34.3 per cent) of voters for the national elections made an inter‐party vote. The proportion of list and preferential votes varies from one party to another: in 2004 the DP was the only party relying on a majority of preferential votes (58.4 per cent), followed by the CSV and the LSAP (47.6 and 46.7 per cent, respectively). As usual, newer parties such as the Greens, the ADR and extreme‐left movements received more list votes (from 57.8 per cent for the Greens to 68.6 per cent for the ADR), given the lack of inter‐party <i>panachage</i> attractiveness of most of their candidates. There are fewer preferential votes expressed for European elections (41.7 per cent).
         </p>
         
         <p>The 2004 elections were a landslide victory for the CSV. Overall, the party of the Prime Minister managed to win 36.1 per cent of the votes, its best national score since 1984.<a href="#en15" class="scrollableLink"><sup>15</sup></a> The difference from the 1999 elections (+6.0 per cent) is spectacular. However, for its political competitors, the most impressive electoral achievement of the CSV in 2004 was the convergence of its scores in the four constituencies: with more than 35 per cent of the votes in each of them, the CSV is the first party in every one of the constituencies.<a href="#en16" class="scrollableLink"><sup>16</sup></a> One has to go back fifty years (to 1954) to find better scores for the CSV in all four constituencies. The vote for incumbent Prime Minister Juncker is another indicator of this indisputable victory: with 41,535 votes at the European elections, he established the highest personal score ever recorded in Luxembourg,<a href="#en17" class="scrollableLink"><sup>17</sup></a> while in his South constituency at the national elections, more than two thirds of the voters who expressed a preferential vote ticked his name.<a href="#en18" class="scrollableLink"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
         
         <p>The party of the Prime Minister obtained 40 per cent of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies (24 out of the 60 seats, an increase of five).<a href="#en19" class="scrollableLink"><sup>19</sup></a> With such results, it was thus obvious that the Grand Duke would ask the leader of the party to form the next government.<a href="#en20" class="scrollableLink"><sup>20</sup></a> The DP, the incumbent junior party, lost badly at the polls (−6.4 per cent and a loss of five seats) and despite an early attempt to minimise their losses by referring to the results of the coalition (that overall had lost no seats), the Liberals knew quickly that they would have to go back to the opposition benches. The ADR, which is in any case not considered <i>koalitionfähig</i>, also lost votes (−1.4 per cent and two seats) and the extreme‐left did not manage to keep the seat it had gained in 1999. There were, on the other hand, two winners between which the CSV could choose a partner: first, the Greens who gained 2.5 per cent and two seats in comparison to 1999; and second, the Socialists who gained only 1.1 per cent, but nevertheless managed to gain one seat.
         </p>
         
         <p>The CSV even managed to receive 1 per cent more in the European elections than in the national ones (+5.5 per cent compared to the 1999 EP elections), a result it had never reached before. Yet an even more spectacular result was recorded in 2004: for the first time, one of the three main traditional parties, the DP, came fourth in the European elections as, with an increase of 4.3 per cent compared to the 1999 EP elections, the Greens (who always fared better in European elections than national ones) reached 15 per cent of the votes and thus secured its seat in Strasburg for the third time in a row. The other two main parties in opposition at the national level, the LSAP and the ADR, lost votes in these European elections and were also disappointed in terms of seats: although retaining 22.1 per cent of the votes, the Socialists lost their second MEP, and with a mere 8 per cent of the votes, the sovereigntists (who always fared worse in European elections than national ones) did not manage to have one of their candidates elected.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>As a result of the elections, for the first time in their existence, the Greens were in a position where they could be part of a two‐party coalition government, as together with the CSV they would have had a one seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies. However, taking into account the short‐term constraint of presiding over the EU Council and the longer‐term problem of electoral liability for the obviously dominant party of the coalition, the prospect of such a narrow majority (with a powerful opposition consisting for the most part of the two rather large traditional parties, LSAP and DP), with a party with no governmental experience and limited potential ministerial personnel, made the choice of the Greens too risky. Instead, Prime Minister Juncker (who had been appointed <i>formateur</i> by the Grand Duke on 15 June) chose to start government formation negotiations with the LSAP.<a href="#en21" class="scrollableLink"><sup>21</sup></a> On 26 June, the National Council of the CSV thus formally decided to invite the LSAP to the negotiation table and on 28 June the Executive Committee of the Socialists accepted this invitation. A first meeting took place on 1 July between two party delegations of nine members (excluding the <i>formateur</i>) to set the agenda. Then a couple of rounds were devoted to the analysis of the economic and financial situation, with reports from the relevant high civil servants, and to reports on social security. Seven working groups were subsequently created and several plenary meetings were still needed to arrive at the signing of the coalition agreement on 29 July, after 15 negotiation sessions and several reports of the <i>formateur</i> to the Grand Duke. The results of the negotiations were approved by party congresses on 30 July.
         </p>
         
         <p>The CSV received the lion's share in terms of number of portfolios, with the position of Prime Minister, seven other ministers and a secretary of state, for five LSAP ministers and one minister‐delegate. Moreover, the Socialists received ministerial responsibilities in the most sensitive fields of the day such as education, transport and immigration. In the policy package of the coalition agreement, issues like the introduction of the principle of dual nationality, keeping a compulsory course of religion in the primary and secondary school system, and the payment of the education allowance for mothers on maternity leave through the pension budget rather than the general state budget also have a pronounced CSV flavour. The latter issue almost threatened the acceptance of the results of the negotiations by the LSAP congress, as an important figure on its negotiating team (John Castegnaro, former leader of the powerful OGB‐L trade union) contested this decision and accused Juncker of having forced an ultimatum on its adoption. Overall, election results (the ‘incontournable’ character of the CSV and the more powerful than ever Jean‐Claude Juncker) were proportionally reflected in the government formation outputs.</p>
         
         <p>Whether the predominance of the CSV over government may eventually turn into a liability for the next election is a recurring question, as most of the time it is the junior party that has suffered after government participation. However, in order to find such a difference in legislative seats between partners (ten seats) one has to go back to 1969–1974, the legislature that led the CSV to an electoral defeat provoked its only withdrawal from government in the postwar era. Moreover, 2004 showed that Juncker had other ambitions than being Prime Minister of his country, so the difficult question of the succession of such an electoral asset for the party will undoubtedly be addressed during the coming legislature. On the other hand, one of the most outstanding lessons of the 2004 elections was that the CSV showed no geographical weakness to its competitors. Hence, the coming legislature will be most challenging for both the longstanding party in government and all its competitors.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>Article 24 of the Luxembourg Constitution, concerning freedom of the press, was modified. In the new version, the exigency of caution for writers, editors and publishing house and stamping rights for foreign newspapers were abolished (see below for the new freedom of press and media law adopted in 2004).</p>
         
         <p>Article 63 of the Constitution was abrogated and Article 65 was amended. The aim of the reform was to speed the adoption of laws by making the vote on individual articles that was required before the vote on the full text optional. A minimum of five MPs may now ask for a vote on one or several articles of the law before the vote on the full text. The Constitution now also mentions that vote‐by‐proxy is authorised. Each MP may, however, only represent one absent MP.</p>
         
         <p>The Luxembourg ombudsman's office was officially installed in May (see <span title=""><a href="#b8" id="#b8R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; Poirier 2004</a></span>). He handed in an intermediary report in September to the <i>Chambre des députés</i>.
         </p>
         
         <p>In June, following conventions signed in 2003, the Anglican Church and the both the Romanian Orthodox and Serb Orthodox religions in Luxembourg were given legal personality and granted public financing for the payment of their personnel.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the governmental bill on the introduction of institutional rules for (semi‐) direct democracy was amended due to the unconstitutional aspects of popular initiative for bills proposals and referenda uncovered by the Council of State (see <span title=""><a href="#b8" id="#b8R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; Poirier 2004</a></span>).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In April, an international convention on trans‐border development was signed between the Luxembourg and French governments. It consisted of a modification of borders between the two countries and a joint effort for the development of infrastructures and transport in the Belval area, which is an important new economic pole for the Grand Duchy with its scientific research site. In terms of internal borders, the <i>Chambre des députés</i> voted on the proposal of a voluntary fusion of two communes (Bastendorf and Fouhren). A trend towards voluntary fusions of small communes in order to achieve gains in efficiency is expected, as there are also two other projects to be implemented after the 2005 local elections.
         </p>
         
         <p>In May, a new law on collective agreements was adopted. The new law concerns only employees from the private sector. It defines precisely the nature of a ‘representative’ trade union as it distinguishes three types: national trade unions, trade unions well represented in an important sector of the national economy, and trade unions that receive a mandate directly or indirectly from a minimum of 50 per cent of the employees of a specific sector. The principle of collective agreement uniqueness was also confirmed. The former law, approved in 1965, excluded sectoral and enterprise‐level unions as well as employee representatives within the workplace.</p>
         
         <p>A new law on the freedom of press and media was adopted in June 2004. The first law was promulgated in 1869. The modernisation of the law concerned mainly the protection of sources and journalistic material, but also the respect for private life and a conscience clause for journalists. Journalists can only invoke protection of sources and journalistic material if they do not violate laws on criminal affairs, money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorism and state security. Journalists must respect the individual's right to privacy. They must also defend the right to information, a fundamental individual right that enriches the private life of citizens by permitting them to enlarge their knowledge. The new law also harmonises the right of reply for citizens, nongovernmental organisations and private firms. Finally, journalists obtained a conscience clause. They can unilaterally interrupt their contract with an editor if the editorial orientation has changed notably. Journalists are responsible for their own acts, and cannot blame others for what they have done. They cannot be forced to resort to unethical practices, or to put their names on stories that have been substantially modified. This new law was accompanied by a constitutional amendment (see above). At the end of the month, Marc Zanussi, an LSAP MP who had just been re‐elected, died in an accident.</p>
         
         <p>Later in the year, the government‐mandated report of a French professor (Fontagné) on the economic competitiveness of Luxembourg was published and raised concerns both in the political and economic (especially trade union) spheres. Among other things, it pleaded for a real opening of public‐sector jobs to non‐Luxembourgers and for the abolition of the mechanism of automatic salary indexation (adaptations when certain consumer price thresholds are reached) (see <a href="http://www.eco.public.lu/documentation/rapports/Rapport_Fontagne.pdf" class="linkBehavior">http://www.eco.public.lu/documentation/rapports/Rapport_Fontagne.pdf</a>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Overall, a great deal of activities for both the old and the new government consisted in visits abroad and meetings in order to prepare for Luxembourg's Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers, to be held in the first half of 2005, and in the organisation of the referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty to be held on 10 July 2005. In September 2004, Jean‐Claude Juncker, who is also Luxembourg's Minister of Finance was appointed the first president of the ‘Eurogroup’ for two years (before 2004, this position rotated with the presidency of the EU and according to the membership of the ‘Eurozone’ of the relevant country). This position will allow Mr Juncker to represent the countries that have chosen the common currency in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the G7.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, a news item horrified the Grand Duchy: in October, a Congolese and Luxembourg resident woman, Maggy Delvaux, immolated herself on one of the main squares of the capital. This suicide in public was aimed at denouncing what she considered the racist treatment of her own and her husband's cases by Luxembourg's administration.</p>
