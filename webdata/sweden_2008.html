         <p>On the whole, the political year of 2009 was relatively quiet. The main events were related to the European Union (EU): the European Parliament (EP) election in June and the Swedish presidency of the EU from July to December. The economic recession continued, but appeared to ease off in the second half of the year. The centre‐right Alliance Government continued in office with only one minor, and politically insignificant, change in its composition. Opinion polls, however, indicated that the opposition parties were ahead of the government for most of the year.</p>

         <p>Sweden's fourth election to the EP was held on 7 June. The campaign was fairly low‐key, and an unrealistic proposal by the Social Democrats to renegotiate the EU Directive on posted workers failed to raise the temperature. Turnout nevertheless rose for the first time ever for an EP election – by 7.6 percentage points compared to 2004. Indeed, the overall turnout of 45.5 per cent, including blank and invalid votes, was the highest ever for a Swedish EP election.</p>
         
         <p>For the established parties, the result was characterised by stability. Early opinion polls had suggested that the Moderate Party could overtake the Social Democrats as the biggest party, but the eventual result maintained the gap between the two dominant parties. For both parties, the result was significantly below their respective strength in parliamentary elections, but the Social Democrats' position as the biggest party was not seriously threatened (see <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a>). Among the other parties there were gains for the People's Party Liberals and the Greens, losses for the Left Party and more or less status quo for the other established parties. There were, however, notable shifts in support for outsider challenger parties. The EU‐critical June List had broken through in 2004, with three seats. Subsequently, however, the party had problems with defections, leadership changes and a disappointing performance in the 2006 parliamentary election. The 2009 result of 3.5 per cent was in fact better than had been expected before the campaign, but it was not enough to maintain the representation in the EP. The party was not closed down as a result of the election, but its future looked uncertain.

As a consequence of the Treaty of Lisbon, however, the Swedish representation will increase from 18 to 20 members.

         <p>On the other hand, the Pirate Party broke through, and entered the EP for the first time with 7.1 per cent of the vote. Formed in 2006, the Pirate Party prioritises information technology privacy and integrity issues. In particular, it opposes measures to outlaw the sharing of music, films and written text on the Internet, and opposes the IPRED law, passed by Parliament in February, which allows copyright holders to trace file‐sharing and downloading on the Internet. The Pirate Party is also vehemently critical of the so‐called ‘FRA law’, which makes wireless telecommunications traffic subject to possible monitoring by the National Defence Radio Establishment (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2009</a></span>: 1120). The Pirate Party received 0.7 per cent of the vote in the 2006 parliamentary election, but gained momentum in the wake of the FRA debate. It is organised as an Internet‐based network, and claims to have over 20,000 members.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of the other challengers, the immigration‐critical Sweden Democrats received 3.3 per cent of the vote and no seats. The party did not, however, put much of its resources into the campaign, and was above the 4 per cent representational threshold in terms of parliamentary voting intentions, according to several opinion polls in 2009.</p>

         <p>Between July and December, Sweden chaired the EU Presidency for the second time (the first time was January to June 2001). Prioritised issues for the Presidency included employment, the global economic crisis, climate and the environment. In the event, however, the most pressing issues during the six‐month period were procedural. Sweden had ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in November 2008 (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2009</a></span>: 1121), but the EU‐wide ratification was delayed by the ‘no’ vote in the June 2008 Irish referendum. Ireland voted ‘yes’ in a second referendum in October 2009, and the Treaty was ratified by Poland soon afterwards. Only the Czech Republic remained before full ratification could be secured, but Czech President Vaclav Klaus had misgivings and delayed signing. As the holder of the Presidency, the Swedish government had to handle the situation. After significant international pressure, and interventions by Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, Klaus eventually signed the Treaty, which was to take effect in early 2010. The next urgent matter was the appointment to key positions created as a consequence of the Treaty. At a summit in Brussels on 20 November, the Belgian Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy was appointed the permanent chair of the European Council – a post popularly referred to as the ‘EU President’. The British EU Commissioner Catherine Ashton (Baroness Ashton of Mulholland) was appointed the High Representative for foreign affairs and security policy (‘EU Foreign Minister’). Both appointments were compromises, and neither was received with much enthusiasm.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the whole, the Swedish Presidency could be described as a qualified success. It has to be remembered that the EU was threatened by a constitutional crisis at one point during the autumn of 2009, when it seemed possible that the Treaty of Lisbon could be significantly delayed. It would also have been a serious problem for the EU not to have resolved the key personal appointments before the end of 2009. The Swedish government handled these matters with competence and patience, for which it received widespread praise. Progress was also made, albeit with less publicity, in the accession process involving Turkey.</p>
         
         <p>There were, however, also less positive aspects of the Swedish Presidency. Critics argued that it was characterised by a ‘safety first’ approach, with little evidence of vision or forward‐thinking regarding the future of the EU – some even saw the appointment of two relatively anonymous politicians to the two top posts as indications of this. The achievements regarding environment and climate change were also somewhat disappointing. The Swedish government had hoped to make the EU an influential force at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December, but the much heralded meeting did not produce any tangible result. This could hardly be blamed solely on the EU or on the Swedish Presidency, but it was regarded as a disappointment. The impact of the Presidency on EU‐related opinion in Sweden was limited. Polls published in early December indicated solid support for continued EU membership, while the electorate was evenly divided regarding possible introduction of the euro.</p>
         
         <p>After the ratification process of the Treaty of Lisbon had been completed, a new EU Commission was appointed. The Swedish Commissioner since 1999, the former Social Democratic cabinet minister Margot Wallström, retired after having served for two consecutive five‐year periods. On 17 November, Wallström's successor was announced as EU minister Cecilia Malmström. An MEP for the People's Party Liberals (1999–2006), Malmström joined the Alliance Government with responsibility for European affairs after the 2006 election. Malmström has a PhD in Political Science, is proficient in several non‐Swedish languages and was a fairly uncontroversial choice. She had not kept a high public profile as EU minister, but is very well connected in EU circles. Largely behind the scenes, she played an important role during the Swedish EU Presidency. She was later charged with the potentially delicate portfolio of migration and crime prevention. Malmström did not formally leave the government to join the Commission until early 2010.</p>
         
         <p>The only change in the cabinet to take effect during 2009 was due to the retirement of Lars Leijonborg as Minister for Higher Education and Research. Leijonborg was the leader of the People's Party Liberals (1997–2007), but was effectively demoted from the leadership after his party had performed disappointingly in the 2006 election (<span title=""><a href="#b1%20#b2" id="#b1 #b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Widfeldt 2007, 2008</a></span>). Having stepped down as party leader, Leijonborg was replaced as head of the Ministry of Education by his successor as party leader, Jan Björklund. Unusually for a former party leader, however, Leijonborg continued in the cabinet for almost two years, but retired from frontline politics in June 2009 (he left his place in Parliament at the same time). His replacement was announced as Tobias Krantz, also from the People's Party Liberals. Having achieved a doctorate in Political Science in 2002, Krantz has been an MP since the election of the same year. His appointment was uncontroversial, and had no impact on the composition or political direction of the government.

         <p>Other notable political issues during the course of 2009 included energy policy, where the governing Alliance parties reached an agreement on 5 February to abandon a phasing out process of nuclear power initiated by the previous Social Democratic Government. The new energy policy agreement meant that decommissioned nuclear reactors may be replaced by new reactors. The agreement represented a significant shift for the Centre Party, for which opposition to nuclear power had been something of a flagship policy since the 1970s. Hence, it also removed one of the remaining obstacles to continued cohesion among the Alliance parties. A law, codifying the new energy policy was planned to be presented to Parliament before the 2010 election.</p>
         
         <p>On 5 November, the Swedish government went along with other states around the Baltic Sea in approving the construction of a gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. The pipeline will not enter Swedish waters, but will pass near the eastern coast of the Swedish island of Gotland. Critics have argued that the pipeline could bring environmental as well as security problems for Sweden. There are also concerns about the impact of the pipeline on relations between Russia and its post‐communist neighbouring countries. The Swedish opposition parties indicated that they may seek to reconsider the matter if they win the 2010 election, but the decision seems irreversible.</p>
         
         <p>A defence bill, approved by Parliament in May, completed the transition of a conscript‐based Swedish defence into professional, contracted units. At the same time, the bill envisaged increased mobilisation capacity for the Swedish defence, which currently is extremely weak.</p>
         
         <p>After very pessimistic predictions early in 2009, there were indications towards the end of the year that Sweden was about to emerge relatively unharmed by the recession compared to other European countries. On the whole, however, the economic year was a difficult one. The growth rate of calendar adjusted GDP sank from −0.5 per cent in 2008 to −4.7 per cent in 2009, according to a report published in March 2010 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER). The renewed optimism was reflected in the same report, however, in that the NIER projected a return to positive growth in 2010 of 2.1 per cent. Increased government spending driven by the recession contributed to a fiscal deficit of SEK 176.1 billion (approx. €17 billion), a massive change compared to 2008, when a surplus of SEK 135 billion (at the time approx. €14 billion) was reported. The national debt rose by SEK 70 billion to 1,189 billion (€120 billion). It also rose relative to GDP, from 35 per cent in 2008 to 39 per cent in 2009.</p>
         
         <p>The recession also made its presence felt on the labour market. Some 115,000 redundancies were announced during the year, compared to 96,000 in 2008. The annual average rate of unemployment went up to 4 per cent of the adult population. Another 2 per cent were involved in labour market schemes, which meant a total unemployment rate of 6 per cent, representing an increase of 2.3 percentage points compared to 2008 (figures from the Swedish Public Employment Service).</p>
         
         <p>According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation was well within the central bank's target rate of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of plus or minus one percentage point throughout 2009, fluctuating between a high of 1.3 per cent in January and a low of −1.6 per cent in September. There was deflation between April and November. The Repo interest rate was lowered by the Riksbanken three times in 2009. At the beginning of the year it was 1.0 per cent. It was lowered to 0.5 per cent in April, and again to 0.25 per cent in June, and was held at that level for the remainder of the year.</p>
