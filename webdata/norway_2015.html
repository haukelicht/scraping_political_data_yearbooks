         <p>The main political event in Norway in 2015 was the municipal and county council elections in September. The results proved to be disappointing for the two national governing parties: the Conservative Party and right‐wing populist Progress Party. The main winner of the elections was the Greens. They established themselves for the first time as a national political force by gaining representation in all parts of the country. The European refugee crisis dominated political debate in Norway for much of the year. Falling oil prices negatively affected the Norwegian economy, and prompted politicians to address economic issues in a way that they have not had to in some time.</p>

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="epdy12141-sec-0030"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="epdy12141-sec-0030-title"> Municipal and provincial elections</h3>
            
            <p>The municipal (<i>kommune</i>) and provincial (<i>fylke</i>) elections were held on 14 September. The governing parties lost considerable support in the election. The governing Conservative Party had their share of the vote decrease by five percentage points since the previous local elections in 2011 and ended up with 23 per cent of the vote. However, the Conservatives’ 2011 election result was an all‐time high, and their loss of votes from 2011 to 2015 did not fully erase the gains it made in 2011. Their coalition partner, the Progress Party, experienced its worst local election since 1991, receiving less than 10 per cent of the vote.
            </p>
            
            <p>The main opposition party, the Labour Party, had performed well in the local elections of 2011 (Aalberg <span title=""><a href="#epdy12141-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12141-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>), but increased its share of the vote by 1.3 points, ending up at 33 per cent. The Green Party, while receiving a far smaller share of the vote, must nevertheless be considered among the winners of the 2015 election. After obtaining representation in the <i>Storting</i> (parliament) for the first time in 2013, the Greens confirmed their new position in Norwegian politics with another record‐breaking election. They increased their share of the vote by 3.3 points to 4.2 per cent. The Greens also became part of the city government in Oslo, where they received 8.1 per cent of the vote.
            </p>
            
            <p>Campaigns in local and regional elections tend to be dominated by local and regional issues. One example is the issue of property taxes, which is the only tax that can be collected by municipalities themselves. Some Norwegian municipalities collect property taxes, others do not. This became a major issue in the city of Oslo, where the opposition Labour Party promised to introduce property taxes mainly to pay for eldercare. The sitting centre‐right city government was strongly opposed, but ended up losing its majority in the city council.</p>
            
            <p>At the national level, the campaign was dominated by the refugee crisis (see below). During the campaign, the opinion climate was very sympathetic towards the refugees. Hence, the Progress Party, with a restrictive immigration platform, did not benefit from immigration being on the agenda.</p>
            
            <p>Although several factors contribute to explaining why the governing parties lost heavily at the polls, it is a fair assumption that they suffered from the ‘wear and tear of government’ – that is, the tendency of governing parties to lose support at the polls (Narud &amp; Valen <span title=""><a href="#epdy12141-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12141-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>). The fact that political circumstances prevented the Progress Party from benefiting from their anti‐immigration platform for the second local election in a row most likely also contributed to their bad result.
            </p>
            
            <p>Turnout in local elections was, as in most countries, lower than for national elections. Turnout in the municipal election was 60.0 per cent, a decrease from 64.2 in the 2011 election. In the provincial election, turnout was 56 per cent, a decrease of four points since the last election.</p>

         <p>The coalition government of the Conservative Party and Progress Party was formed in October 2013, and for two years Prime Minister Solberg stuck to her initial team of cabinet ministers. Not until December 2015 did she do the first reshuffling of cabinet posts. In total, the reshuffle involved seven new appointees, two of whom were reassigned from other ministerial positions (Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12141-tbl-0001">1</a>). Most notably, the Minister of Agriculture Sylvi Listhaug of the Progress Party became the new Minister of Immigration and Integration. The outspoken and controversial Progress Party politician thus gained responsibility for a policy area that was already much debated and controversial. The total number of ministers went up from 18 to 19, and the Progress Party increased its number from seven to eight ministers (from 39 to 42 per cent). Most of the reshuffling constituted undramatic substitutions of low‐profile cabinet members. It is worth mentioning, however, that the high‐profile deputy leader of the Progress Party, Per Sandberg, was appointed Minister of Fisheries, replacing Elisabeth Aspaker from the Conservatives.

         <p>The composition of parliament in 2015 reflected the 2013 election. The few changes in gender composition that can be observed between 1 January and 31 December are due to ministerial appointments and long‐term leaves of absence.</p>

         <p>A major issue in Norway in 2015, as in most European countries, was how to handle the large movement of refugees and asylum seekers into Europe. Norway is not the first destination of choice for migrants, in part because it is positioned at the far north of Europe (while most migrants arrive from the south), and probably also because the country does not have a reputation of being as welcoming to migrants as its neighbour Sweden, or Germany. Throughout much of the year, therefore, the migration crisis in Europe did not affect Norway in a significant manner. Political debate centred on the suffering of those who were migrating, and especially on those who drowned while trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean. In April, the opposition Labour Party proposed an increase in the acceptance of Syrian refugees to Norway to 10,000 people over a two‐year period. This was not met with approval from the junior partner in the sitting government, the Progress Party. The Prime Minister's Conservative Party negotiated with Labour and other parties in parliament, and in June they reached a compromise agreement that Norway would accept an additional 8,000 refugees over three years.</p>
         
         <p>Later in the year, migrants started arriving in Norway in much greater numbers than was envisaged by the agreement in June. This shifted the public political debate from one of compassion with migrating peoples to a focus on securing the borders and limiting immigration. The shift in tone and focus in public debate in Norway was quite stark in the course of a few months in the autumn of 2015. The local elections on 14 September occurred at a time when public sympathy with migrants was at a high point. The governing Progress Party suffered at the polls in that election, in part because their anti‐immigration rhetoric and policies did not fit well with the public mood at the time. A few months later, the party strongly improved its standing in the electorate according to several public opinion surveys.</p>
         
         <p>The Norwegian economy relies substantially on oil and gas exports and the fall in oil prices through 2015 had a significant impact on that industry, and on the general Norwegian economy. The southwestern part of the country was especially hard hit, not just in the oil and gas sector, but also in sectors that provide goods and services to the oil industry. Unemployment rose substantially in Rogaland County in 2015, and marginally in the country as a whole. After several years of a booming Norwegian economy, the prospect of rising unemployment and a drop in oil revenues shifted political debate somewhat in 2015. Economic issues came to the forefront as the political parties debated how best to deal with this new economic uncertainty.</p>
         
         <p>A final central issue that had an impact on Norwegian politics in 2015 was the attempt by the national government to instigate a reform of municipal amalgamation. A major goal of the sitting Conservative government is to reduce the number of Norwegian municipalities, and to make sure that these units are of a size that enables them to take on greater responsibilities for the implementation of services for their citizens. Specific proposals for mergers of municipalities tend to face resistance locally. This became an issue for some mobilisation in the local elections and for national political debate throughout 2015.</p>
