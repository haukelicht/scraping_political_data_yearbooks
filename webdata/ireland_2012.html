         <p>At the forefront of the global economic crisis, politics in Ireland continued to be dominated by the economy and the austerity measures being implemented by the Fine Gael‐Labour coalition government. Though 2011 had seen a change in government, the broad policies set out by the so‐called ‘troika’ (the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund) were agreed in 2010 when Ireland entered the loan programme.</p>
         
         <p>The government of the centre‐right Fine Gael and the centre‐left Labour Party had a tense year. Labour had campaigned on the promise that it would soften some of the harsher measures that Fine Gael wished to impose. Labour made very specific promises to the electorate on, for instance, child benefit and university tuition fees, which it was forced to renege upon. The party then came under increasing pressure as the government introduced policies in direct contradiction of Labour's earlier promises and falling support in opinion polls and exposed divisions within the party.</p>
         
         <p>A major goal for the government parties was to reduce the cost of the ‘bail‐out’ programme. The Irish government had tried to impose losses on senior bondholders in Irish banks, but these were rejected by the ECB. In March promissory notes (a type of IOU), which the Irish government had issued and given to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation as a way of preventing the immediate collapse of the insolvent Anglo Irish Bank, were due to be paid to the Irish central bank. The ECB allowed Ireland defer the initial payment. While this was sold in Ireland as a major breakthrough, there was no agreement to restructure these payments. Indeed, senior unsecured bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank were paid €1.9 billion in mid‐April. Given that both government parties had campaigned on the promise that these would not be paid, it added to the government's unpopularity and that of the European Union institutions, which were largely blamed.</p>
         
         <p>The government's popularity probably was not helped by what appeared to be evidence that the government was out of touch. The Minister for Finance made a claim that emigration was driven by a desire to see other parts of the world and not the high levels of unemployment. Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny, in a speech at Davos on the Irish financial crisis, explained that Irish people simply ‘went mad borrowing’, which contradicted what he said in an address to the nation months earlier in which he claimed the crisis was not the fault of ordinary Irish people. Labour's Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, defended a cut to the ‘back to school’ clothing and footwear allowance by pointing to what she said was good value in the shops.</p>
         
         <p>So while Irish politicians seemed to bask in glory abroad, as Ireland presented itself as a model member of a bail‐out programme, domestically the government lost a good deal of the popularity it had enjoyed through 2011. This was in part due to the mishandling of renegotiations of the bail‐out programme. Ministers led the public to believe that there would be a major breakthrough that would save Ireland significant sums in repaying the loans made to Ireland, but these never materialised. Instead the country was told it was in a ‘special position’ compared to the other programme countries, but by the end of 2012 this had not yielded any material benefits.</p>
         
         <p>These failures led to increased tensions both between and within the governing parties. One junior minister from the Labour Party, Róisín Shorthall, resigned in a dispute with her senior Fine Gael Minister for Health. She was charged with deciding on where primary care units were located. Shorthall claimed that her senior minister, James Reilly (who has formal responsibility for all decisions), had overruled her and reweighted the items in an index that was meant to be used to decide where to locate the primary care centres. The result of this was that two units were to be built in the minister's own constituency and some others in the constituencies of other cabinet ministers. Shorthall accused Reilly of ‘stroke’ politics. As Reilly had been a minister who was unpopular within the government, it was expected Shorthall's party leader would back her in some way. In fact she felt she was not supported by the Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Éamon Gilmore or other Labour cabinet ministers, and resigned complaining of a lack of support for the ‘programme of government and the values that underpin it’. Her resignation caused more trouble within the Labour Party than between the government parties.</p>
         
         <p>Labour had promised that there would be no cuts in social welfare payments, but this promise applied to unemployment or dole payments only. Instead the government cut a variety of allowances, including to those for caregivers of the elderly and disabled. This made plausible the accusations that the government targeted the most vulnerable in society. As the government had promised there would be no tax increases and guaranteed that there would be no further cuts in public sector wages, it had to make savings anywhere it could. Ultimately it announced that it would renegotiate a deal on public sector pay, which was due to come into force in 2013.</p>
         
         <p>The budget in December was difficult for Labour Party members in particular to support. The party chairman, Colm Keaveney, resigned the parliamentary party whip over a budget measure to reduce child benefit, a universal social welfare payment to all mothers. He also rejected party requests to resign as chairman of the party even though he was no longer sitting on the government benches. With a senator also resigning the whip, this brought to six the number of people who had left Labour's parliamentary party since the election.</p>
         
         <p>As part of the agreement with the ‘troika’, the government introduced a local property tax, which led to some protests and a very low payment rate. Householders were required to register to pay the tax with their local authority. Just about half of households had registered by the deadline at the end of March, but this was possibly linked to the poor design of the website on which people had to register. If anything, Ireland has been remarkable for the lack of public protests that are observed in other European countries.</p>
         
         <p>Late in the year one issue did cause such expressions of anger as we might have expected on the economy: abortion. In mid‐November <i>The Irish Times</i> published a story outlining how a pregnant woman, Savita Halapranavar, had died in a hospital in Galway arising from an infection caused by her pregnancy. She had been diagnosed as miscarrying, and was in great pain. Her family claimed that she repeatedly asked that the pregnancy be terminated as it was not viable. This was refused because of the existence of a foetal heartbeat, which the doctors claimed meant that they could not legally abort the foetus. It was also reported, and since confirmed, that one nurse said to her that it could not happen because ‘this is a Catholic country’.
         </p>
         
         <p>Immediately calls emerged for legislation on the 1992 X case judgement, in which the Irish Supreme Court found that abortion was legal in some circumstances including where the health of the mother was at risk. Irish politicians had neglected to legislate on this issue since the ruling, but opinion polls indicated a significant change in public attitudes on the issue. By 2012 a majority supported abortion in such circumstances. However the pro‐life movement also quickly mobilised and organised protest marches against any legislation that might put in place a legal regime to facilitate abortion in Ireland.</p>
         
         <p>There were immediate calls for a public inquiry into Halapranavar's death, though the government resisted these. This was despite the very unusual intervention of Irish President Michael D. Higgins, who said any form of inquiry should satisfy the needs of the family. Halapranavar's husband had called for a full public inquiry. Within the government the two parties divided on the issue. Most in Labour were in favour of legislating on abortion, whereas a sizeable number of Fine Gael TDs (MPs) were known to be against legislating and were also coming under significant pressure from the pro‐life lobby.</p>
         
         <p>The reluctance to open a public inquiry on this issue was in part due to the experience of public inquires in Ireland. They tend to run for many years, with their costs often thought excessive. One of these, the Mahon Tribunal, established in 1997 to inquire into ‘certain planning matters and payments’, finally reported in March 2012. It found that corruption affected ‘every level of Irish political life and was allowed to continue unabated’. In particular it concluded that the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern – whose government had set up the tribunal – failed to ‘truthfully’ explain the source of IR£215,000 (€273,000) in his bank accounts. It rejected Ahern's evidence of ‘dig‐outs’, where he had claimed that he received money from friends who wanted to help him out when his marriage broke down. In reaction he spoke about an injustice being done to him, but resigned from the Fianna Fáil party. Though he was no longer an office holder, this was symbolically important. Another prominent member of Fianna Fáil, the former EU Commissioner Pádraig Flynn, was found to have ‘wrongly and corruptly’ sought donations from businessman Tom Gilmartin. It was Gilmartin's allegations that first led to the tribunal's establishment. The government referred the report to the Garda (police) commissioner, the director of public prosecutions, the revenue commissioners and to the standards in public office commission, but by the end of the year no charges had been publicly made.</p>
         
         <p>In December a constitutional convention met for the first time. This is an exercise in deliberative democracy whereby 100 citizens (66 randomly selected members of the public, 33 parliamentarians and a chairman) meet to consider a range of issues that might lead to constitutional change. The convention will meet in 2013 to consider possible changes in a number of areas, including the provision of marriage for same‐sex couples, a change to the electoral system and reducing the term of the President. The convention will make recommendations to government, which to be implemented will have to be put to referendum.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12015-sec-0002"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12015-sec-0002-title"> Referendums</h2>
         
         <p>Though it was not a EU referendum, the Irish government received legal advice from the Attorney General that it was necessary to hold a referendum to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in Economic and Monetary Union (better known as the ‘fiscal compact’). The treaty agreed earlier in 2012 was sponsored by Germany as a measure designed to prevent excessive government spending in the future as a condition of establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Given that a number of EU treaties had been rejected in the previous decade, and the EU was widely blamed for the continuing austerity measures, it was not clear that this treaty would be passed. That the Irish government had not been given any concessions on its debt also made passing the referendum more difficult. On the actual issue of the treaty, whether governments should be prevented from running ‘structural’ budget deficits, opinion polls indicated a clear majority in Ireland was in favour. This made even more crucial the framing of the treaty.</p>
         
         <p>Most of the main political parties supported the treaty, with Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil arguing that it would be good for ‘jobs and growth’. This message had been used before and was hardly plausible. In fact the parties played down the importance of the treaty, but emphasised that rejection would risk Ireland's recovery and that ratification would ensure the country has access to emergency funds from Europe should it require a second bail‐out. It was framed therefore as giving stability to Ireland's position and would ensure fiscal stability because governments would not be able to engage in profligate spending in future.</p>
         
         <p>Sinn Féin and the Socialist Party, opposing the treaty, failed to point out that Ireland had run budget surpluses in the years leading up to its crash. Instead they claimed that what they labeled ‘Austerity Treaty’ institutionalised the need for retrenching budgets. They also argued that, as before, the referendum could be rerun if Ireland rejected it. Because it was not a EU treaty, the rest of the EU was not waiting for Ireland to ratify, as it had done for the Nice and Lisbon treaties. The ‘No’ side also, rather implausibly, tried to link the treaty with Ireland's large national debt. Legal challenges are becoming common in Irish referendums; a last‐minute court case on the legality of advice given by the impartial Referendum Commission failed. The referendum carried by a reasonably comfortable margin of 60 per cent to 40 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>If legal challenges in the fiscal treaty referendum had little impact the same could not be said in the case of the less controversial children's rights referendum. For many years successive governments had promised to amend the Constitution to expressly give children legal rights independent of their parents. The courts had established that these constitutional rights existed but it became a matter of signaling politics that such an amendment was necessary. The small groups opposed to it suggested that allowing the amendment would make it easier for the state to remove children from their parents. Despite this it was an uncontroversial measure, and there was initially very high support for the proposed change. In addition, all parties supported the amendment and spent some money on the campaign</p>
         
         <p>However, a case was taken against the state that asserted that the government's information campaign was leading to a particular position in violation of policy in place since the mid‐1990s that the state may not spend money on campaigns that advocate a particular result. The state won in the high court but lost in an appeal in the supreme court in a judgement delivered a week before polling day. The government was embarrassed and forced to withdraw its information campaign, and allowed the tiny ‘No’ side to allege that it was being bullied by a well‐resourced campaign. This alone might account for why the result was narrower than the opinion polls suggested (though still not tight). Immediately there was a challenge to the validity of the result, which was due to be heard in 2013.</p>
