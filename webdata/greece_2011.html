         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy13-sec-0001-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Averting a chaotic default on the exorbitant public debt continued to be the overriding issue in Greece during 2011. For the same reason, the country retained worldwide importance and attention, since the spectre of a Greek default continued to undermine confidence in the euro and to haunt global markets.</p>
         
         <p>The wave of increasingly violent and anomic behaviour also continued to sweep the country, despite particular police successes like the dismantling of the new terrorist group (‘Nuclei of Fire’) responsible for a series of package bombs the previous year. In January, a protracted local revolt by the town of Keratea, southeast of Athens, involved unprecedented violence against the police and eventually nullified longstanding plans for a waste‐processing plant. Neither radical nor destitute, otherwise conservative people were allowed to go on a rampage in defence of conservative interests subsumed under the slogan ‘Not in My Backyard’ (NIMBY for short). The same was to happen in July, when protesting taxicab owners surpassed even the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) in disrupting ports and airports, deliberately making life difficult for tourists and thereby undermining the country's least hopeless industry: tourism.</p>
         
         <p>A novel form of protest – encouraged or even organised by the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) and the KKE – was the refusal to pay tolls on highways or tickets on public transportation, often with violence against machines, employees and law‐abiding citizens. Another novel movement appeared in imitation of the <i>Indignados</i> in Spain and occupied Syntagma Square in front of the parliament building for protracted periods.
         </p>
         
         <p>For its part, the Papandreou government went from crisis to crisis in its dealings with the ‘troika’ (International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, European Commission) with respect to the loan of €110 billion provided to Greece in May 2010 according to the conditions set out in the ‘Memorandum’ (Mavrogordatos &amp; Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy13-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy13-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 986). In February 2011, the mere mention by the troika's representatives of required privatisations to the tune of €50 billion provoked an explosive reaction against the ‘sale of the country’ also on the part of Papandreou himself and his ministers. The troika's representatives were not to hold a press conference in Greece again.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nevertheless, the irresistible and vertiginous decline of Papandreou's popularity and support for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) continued. In January, PASOK still held 39 per cent of voting intentions against New Democracy's (ND) 30 per cent. By March, PASOK support was no longer sufficient for a parliamentary majority. By June, ND was ahead of PASOK in the polls. On 14 June, another general strike led to an escalation of violent clashes between (heterogeneous) protesters and the riot police in Syntagma Square. Completely demoralised, if not panicked, Prime Minister Papandreou telephoned ND leader Samaras that same afternoon and offered to step down if a grand coalition could be formed. The initiative was immediately aborted due to its mismanagement on both sides.</p>
         
         <p>Papandreou was thus compelled to resort on 17 June to a cabinet reshuffle (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy13-tbl-0001">1</a>) as the second‐best solution to his quandary. Upon the refusal of economics professor (and former vice‐president of the European Central Bank) Lucas Papademos to become Minister of Finance, Papandreou was forced to turn to Minister of Defence Evangelos Venizelos – his rival in the 2007 leadership contest (Mavrogordatos <span><a href="#epdy13-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy13-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>: 995–996). In a remarkably courageous gamble, Venizelos accepted the challenge, left his insulated niche and risked his political future by assuming full responsibility for the salvation of the country's finances as Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister. Otherwise, the reshuffle involved minor changes, except the move of D. Reppas to the crucial Ministry of Administrative Reform and the ouster of economics professor L. Katseli, hitherto the most obdurate and obstructionist member of the cabinet as Minister of Labour. She was replaced by G. Koutroumanis, a seasoned former trade unionist.

         <p>The reorganised Papandreou government received a vote of confidence in the early hours of 22 June, by 155 against 143 with two absent (G. Lianis, who had left PASOK earlier, and Dora Bakoyanni). Nevertheless, anxiety persisted concerning the disbursement of the aid package's fifth installment. With the Greek parliament again under siege, and violent clashes escalating amid charges of police brutality, the so‐called ‘Mid‐term Plan of Fiscal Strategy for 2012–2015’ was approved on 29 June by 155 against 138 with five abstaining (Bakoyanni and the other four MPs of Democratic Alliance or DISY, her new party). One PASOK MP voted against and was promptly expelled. One ND MP voted in favor and left ND. On the next day (30 June), the implementation bill was also approved by 155 against 136.</p>
         
         <p>Nonetheless, the successive austerity measures taken by the Papandreou government could not persuade global markets that the Greek debt was viable, amid a rapidly deepening crisis of confidence in the euro. On 21 July, a European summit in Brussels agreed to ease the terms of the aid package to Greece by doubling its time of maturity and lowering the interest rate to 3.5 per cent. The summit also decided a plan whereby the Greek public debt would be reduced by 21 per cent at the expense of bondholders. Again, this set of belated decisions was to prove inadequate. On 26–27 October, another European summit in Brussels approved a new aid package to Greece and a voluntary reduction (‘haircut’) of the nominal value of Greek bonds by 50 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>Having just secured the salvation of the country's economy and a commitment of its partners and allies on an unprecedented scale, Papandreou proceeded to upset everything by announcing on 31 October that a referendum would be held in Greece on the new aid package – hence, by extension, on the country's continuing membership in the eurozone. Perhaps prompted by the unseemly disorders marring the official parade of 28 October (commemorating the victory over Italy in 1940), Papandreou's gaffe infuriated EU leaders, sent markets crashing worldwide, pushed Greece to the brink of expulsion from the eurozone – and effectively terminated his premiership and political career in Greece.</p>
         
         <p>The formation of a government of grand coalition became urgently imperative if Greece was to repair the damage and avert disaster. For several days, Papandreou stubbornly clung to power through a series of obstructionist and devious manoeuvres. First he demanded and absurdly received, on 4 November, a parliamentary vote of confidence in his government (by 153 to 145) as a precondition for stepping down (!). Then he attempted to impose as new prime minister his old crony F. Petsalnikos, whom he had made Speaker of Parliament in 2009. This particular ploy alienated, at long last, a large part of the PASOK parliamentary group (a third at least). Some of them even took the unprecedented step of joining forces with ND colleagues in a joint rebellion against both party leaderships. It was only then that Papandreou and his family and cronies were finally forced to acknowledge that they were beaten, even though he still clung to the PASOK party leadership (expiring on 11 November) in violation of party statutes.</p>
         
         <p>On 10 November, PASOK, ND and the Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS) agreed at last on Lucas Papademos as the new Prime Minister, whose candidacy should have been obvious from the start. Back in June 2011, Papademos had refused to serve as Minister of Finance under Papandreou. This time he could not refuse the premiership. Nonetheless, his government did not match expectations. With as many as fifty members (including deputy ministers and vice‐ministers), this was probably the largest government <i>ever</i> – needlessly and shockingly at a time of forced austerity. The shares were quite unequal: PASOK 36, ND 6, LAOS 4 and Papademos 4 (including himself).
         </p>
         
         <p>Essentially, the long‐awaited ‘new’ government was a mere continuation of almost the entire PASOK government, including its most useless members, with minor changes (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy13-tbl-0002">2</a>). If it did not salvage his personal hold on power, Papandreou's dilatory manoeuvring perpetuated at least the hold of his party and of his own ministerial appointees. Everybody concerned, including public opinion, was so enervated and exhausted by the time Papademos was appointed that no one could contemplate an equally protracted negotiation of every single ministerial post.

         <p>Oddly enough, this outcome also suited Samaras. After more than a year of strident opposition to the Memorandum (Mavrogordatos &amp; Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy13-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy13-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 986), he sought to rationalise his about‐face by refusing to acknowledge the new government as a coalition government. Instead, he proclaimed that it was only a government with a special task (the implementation of the new aid package of 26–27 October) and limited duration (until mid‐February 2012). Samaras also clung ludicrously to the fiction that ND remained the main opposition party (insinuating spuriously that the related parliamentary privileges should not be handed over to the KKE). Carefully avoiding direct responsibility for the economy, Samaras was content with two unrelated but key ministries (Foreign Affairs and National Defence) which were taken by none other than ND's two vice‐chairmen (S. Dimas and D. Avramopoulos), plus a Deputy Minister of Education, and three vice‐ministers (Finance, Tourism and Health), with the latter more as observers than as actual policy makers. To serve the fiction, Avramopoulos even resigned his parliamentary seat.
         </p>
         
         <p>In contrast, LAOS leader G. Karatzaferis extracted the maximum from the deal that he was instrumental in bringing about: one minister (Infrastructure), one deputy minister (National Defence), two vice‐ministers (Shipping and Agricultural Development) and, above all, respectability. Hitherto denounced and shunned as an extremist party, LAOS finally became a party of government. Those who refused to accept this transformation included most of its own supporters, who were to desert it.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, a few ministers apparently were personal choices of Papademos and are listed in Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy13-tbl-0002">2</a> as ‘non‐party’ although all were connected to PASOK (like himself). Professor A. Giannitsis had been Minister of Labour in the last Simitis government (Simitis III) back in 2000 until he was replaced in October 2001 after his ambitious reform of the social security system was aborted because of the reactions it provoked (Mavrogordatos <span><a href="#epdy13-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy13-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2002</a></span>: 965–967). G. Stavropoulos, a former judge and vice‐president of the supreme administrative court (Council of State), had been chief legal counsel to Prime Minister Papandreou since June 2011. P. Kapsis, son of a PASOK minister, also made his career as a journalist in the Lambrakis press conglomerate – the main supporter of PASOK.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 16 November, the Papademos government received a vote of confidence by an overwhelming majority of 255 (PASOK, ND, LAOS, DISY and some independents). Only 38 voted against: KKE, SYRIZA, Democratic Left or DIMAR, two PASOK MPs protesting the participation of LAOS and P. Kammenos from ND, who was immediately expelled from the parliamentary group (and was soon to launch his own party). Finally, on 6 December, the budget for 2012 was approved by an even bigger majority: 258 against 41.</p> 
         <p>This huge parliamentary majority, however, no longer corresponded to an analogous majority among the electorate. By the end of the year, PASOK had been reduced to some 15 per cent of voting intentions (down from 39 per cent in January) to the benefit mostly of the Left. For its part, ND had made no progress and remained stuck at 30 per cent, while LAOS support stood at 6 per cent (but was shrinking).</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy13-sec-0002-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>The new University Law (Law 4009) which was passed in August 2011 deserves to be mentioned as a major institutional change. It redefined the constitutionally guaranteed monopoly and self‐government of public higher education. It abolished several aberrations imposed since 1982 by PASOK's previous law (Law 1268). Foremost among them was the so‐called ‘university asylum’ which turned university grounds into protected preserves of utter lawlessness (Mavrogordatos <span><a href="#epdy13-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy13-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>: 993; <span><a href="#epdy13-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy13-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2009</a></span>: 971). Another was the plethoric student representation in university bodies and elections through the party youth organisations, which produced the complete penetration of higher education by the political parties.
         </p>
         
         <p>After more than a year of public deliberation, Law 4009 was approved by an unprecedented majority of over 260 MPs from the same parties that were to form or support the Papademos government less than three months later. If the passage of the law proved that a grand coalition was feasible, it also proved that no parliamentary majority, however large, could guarantee implementation. For several months subsequently, organised violence prevented the holding of elections for the new university authorities foreseen by the law, thereby blocking the implementation of its other provisions. The violence was orchestrated by the KKE, SYRIZA and groups of the extra‐parliamentary Left, in collusion with the sitting university rectors and their associates among the faculty. This stalemate was to continue well into 2012.</p>
