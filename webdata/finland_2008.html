         <p>The total number of Finland's seats in the European Parliament (EP) was reduced by one. The reduction to 13 seats put extra pressure on parties, especially the small ones, to win a seat in Parliament. Nevertheless, total votes cast remained low, below the EU average, and slightly lower than in the 2004 elections. To secure at least one seat, True Finns and Christian Democrats joined an electoral alliance. Neither of them was represented in Parliament during the period 2004–2009. Electoral alliances are always a risky affair for those involved. One of the two parties can take all, both can win, or neither of them succeeds. Christian Democrats are known to actively seek electoral alliances and they have the best record of all parties in national parliament elections (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Paloheimo &amp; Sundberg 2009</a></span>: 206–242). Electoral alliances in Finland differ from the mainstream as very different parties join alliances, they have usually no joint programme, candidates appear on separate lists, and they can easily join different parties in the EP. Voters do not care much if a party joins an alliance or not, as it is quite invisible except to those following day‐to‐day politics in the media.
         </p>
         
         <p>This sole alliance in the 2009 elections proved to be very successful for both of its members, and disastrous for the biggest parties. The alliance won 14 per cent of the votes and easily exceeded the Greens and the Left‐wing Alliance in electoral support. Timo Soini, the chairman of True Finns, is an outspoken charismatic leader – just right for a populist party. In addition, he is a strong nationalist appealing to Finnish nationalism and the poor. His agenda is subsequently different from the Christian Democrats, who rest their conservative values on family and morality. Soini became the most popular candidate gaining 130,715 personal votes, though he declared he would only sit in Parliament until the next national elections in April 2011. This declaration gave rise to accusations from opponents that he was fishing for votes by unfair methods. Nevertheless, voters gave him strong support. Number two in the alliance was a Christian candidate, who also managed to win a seat, which would have been impossible without cooperating with True Finns. Once again, Christian Democrat strategy in joining alliances yielded them a much‐needed seat.</p>
         
         <p>The combined effect of the reduction of one seat and the successful electoral alliance had an impact on the big parties. All of them lost one seat and the Left‐wing Alliance lost its one and only seat. However, it is not only a question of electoral rules. All of the unsuccessful big parties, except for National Coalition, lost votes as well. National Coalition managed to slightly increase its share of votes, while the Social Democrats and the Centre Party suffered heavy losses. The result for the Greens was a success as the party increased its share of votes and won a seat bringing its total to two MEPs.</p>
         
         <p>The Swedish People's Party faced a huge problem prior to the elections. It needed to win at least 6 per cent of the votes to keep its only seat. In the 2007 national elections, SFP got 4.6 per cent. With the reduction of one seat in the EP, the target looked unreachable. Moreover, the Åland Islands have, from the very beginning, demanded an <i>ex officio</i> seat in Parliament, without success. That at least would entail a Swedish permanent seat. SFP managed to do a deal with leading groups on Åland: one candidate from Åland was nominated on the SFP list, and in case she was not elected, Åland was guaranteed that an elected SFP member would represent Åland and that he (in the end, Carl Haglund was elected) would appoint an assistant from Åland. Swedish voters in Finland are more active than the Finns; they took advantage of the low turnout and managed to win a seat.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in politics</h2>
         
         <p>Anni Sinnenmäki was elected to be chairman of the Greens in May and replaced Tarja Cronberg. Later, in June, she replaced Cronberg as minister. Cronberg was not elected to Parliament from North Carelia. Cronberg was a popular candidate, but suffered as a result of the high electoral threshold in the small constituency. The case of the Greens fuelled the debate about district magnitude and disproportionality. A revision of the electoral laws is underway in order to enhance proportionality. However, the odd system of proportional elections in the one‐member district on Åland Islands will not be revised, though the electoral threshold is 50 as compared to 14 in North Carelia.</p>
         
         <p>In addition, the law on electoral financing is under revision. The media focus from 2008 resulted in more revelations. Investigations showed that state‐owned companies financed candidates and parties in the 2007 campaign. As the state is prohibited from supporting any particular candidate or party, this incident raised a media storm. Tuija Brax, Minister of Justice, promised to put an end to the practice. Corruption – often not open, but based on an exchange of favours – exists and is widespread in politics, on the national as well as on the local level. Charities, pension funds and businessmen in high positions were shown to actively support political parties, and even the Prime Minister. Connections were found to the main actors in cabinet, the Centre Party and National Coalition. Prime Minister Vanhanen was accused of taking bribes, and so too were many other politicians. Candidates are legally obliged to report who is supporting their campaign and with what amount. Many of them have bad memories.</p>
         
         <p>One of the most forgetful, in turned out, was the Prime Minister. Days before Christmas, Vanhanen announced his intention to resign from leading the Centre Party on the grounds that he would undergo an operation in the autumn. According to his announcement, his resignation would take place during the coming party congress in June 2010. It became unclear, however, whether he would also resign the premiership. Usually the party chairmanship and the premiership are combined, and although it is not a necessity, it would seem odd if they were not. In any case, it soon became clear that it was not his health that was the problem, but suspicions about bribes and severe shortcomings in the official report on the financing of his 2007 campaign. Centre supporters had hitherto seen him as a responsible leader; any suggestion of wrongdoing on his part might well shadow the coming electoral campaign in 2011. His resignation would hopefully wipe the slate clean for his party.</p>
         
         <p>The President of Finland ratified the Lisbon Treaty in October 2009, without waiting for a decision from the Parliament (Lagting) of autonomous Åland. A decision from the Lagting had been due since April 2008. Demands from Åland to increase its influence in the EU did not meet with much sympathy. From the very beginning of Finnish EU membership, Åland has been denied a permanent seat in the EP by the Finnish government – much to the disappointment of the Åland Islands administration. In the end, the Åland Lagting approved the Lisbon agreement in November 2009, with 24 votes for and four votes against after an intense debate about the democratic deficit. Ultimately, a majority of the Lagting feared that any attempt to force the Finnish government to renegotiate might backfire.</p>
         
         <p>People on Åland meet with discrimination from the majority population, and the same holds true for Finland's Swedes along the south and west coasts. As a member of cabinet, the Swedish People's Party has failed to resist reforms that were arguably prejudicial to the Swedish population in Finland. Administrative units have been enlarged where former small district courts, police districts and other administration enlargements have tilted the bilingual balance. In addition to centralisation, services in Swedish are threatened. Protests have had minor success in the process of centralisation at state and local levels in the name of efficiency. The decision to close down a mainly Swedish maternity ward with high international ranking, met huge protests, but in vain. A vast Finnish majority can easily centralise public functions giving little room to the Swedish minority.</p>
         
         <p>Refugees and immigrants have also faced a tougher climate in Finland. Their numbers are relatively small, but at a time of deepening economic recession foreigners were targeted not only by True Finns, but also in a more sophisticated way by other parties. Stricter asylum rules were being prepared by the government. Minister of Migration Astrid Thors was heavily attacked (even subjected to death threats) for her defence of refugees and stood alone in cabinet in her demands to force municipalities to host them. The unwillingness of municipalities to welcome quota refugees is a severe problem. Prime Minister Vanhanen apparently feared that Finland would overflow with refugees. He was far from alone with similar views in the Finnish government.</p>
         
         <p>On 1 January 2010, the new university law will come into force. From then on universities in Finland will be separated from the state. The reform was much debated and criticised. The call to have a majority of outsiders in university executives is questioned since it would violate university autonomy. Minister of Education Henna Virkkunen defended the law and proposed that it was up to the universities to decide if they wanted a majority of outsiders or not. Much of the reform was about economy: universities would take full responsibility for their finances and take over the role of employer from the state; small departments would merge into big ones in order to have a skilled administration familiar with budgeting and economic reporting.</p>
         
         <p>A reform of the Constitution is on its way. Foreign policy was previously one of the key functions of the President. Under the new Constitution dating from 2000 this was blurred, with the President sharing responsibility with the cabinet. In addition, the EU is not clearly seen as foreign policy and the relationship with the Prime Minister in other foreign affairs has caused friction. The President was opposed to reform, but a committee is working in order to deliver a clear division of labour. Together with the coming electoral reform, this and the university issue discussed above have and will get much attention when the amendments are finally debated in Parliament.</p>
         
         <p>The big gas pipe project connecting Russia with Germany got Finnish approval in the autumn. Finland had no political objections; only environmental risks were raised. The Prime Minister praised the project as it also will have positive effects on employment in the coastal cities of Kotka and Hangö, which serve as bases for the construction fleet. Unemployment in the country was around 10 per cent, with only a few faint signs of economic recovery around the corner.</p>
