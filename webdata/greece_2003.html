         <p>On 7 January 2004, Prime Minister K. Simitis announced a slightly early date for the next parliamentary election (7 March) and unveiled, at last, the deal concocted with Foreign Minister George A. Papandreou over the past several months (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2004</a></span>). The deal involved the immediate transfer of PASOK's party leadership to Papandreou. Presented as a demonstration of ‘selfless statesmanship’ on the part of Simitis, it was actually the only move whereby he could avoid the humiliating electoral defeat consistently predicted by opinion polls.
         </p>
         
         <p>This essentially private transmission of the party leadership was subsequently ratified unanimously by PASOK's parliamentary group, Central Committee, and an extraordinary Congress, held on 6 February with 5,000 delegates. It was even ratified on 8 February by over one million votes, in an unprecedented popular plebiscite in which anybody could vote (not just party members). Save for a thousand blanks, unanimity was preserved, in the absence of other options. Nonetheless, a misleading comparison was made with party primaries in the United States and elsewhere. The plebiscite was even hailed as the inauguration of ‘participatory democracy’, although it was actually more reminiscent of PASOK's populist beginnings under the charismatic Andreas G. Papandreou (father of George).</p>
         
         <p>Son and grandson of prime ministers, flanked by his brothers and his American mother, G. Papandreou perpetuates the most tenacious and successful political dynasty in modern Greek history. In addition to the family past, his youthful and unconventional image produced an immediate change of mood among PASOK followers (although this was marred by an untimely scandal involving a junior minister and several PASOK MPs). The new leader immediately started exploiting the plebiscite as an unconditional personal ‘mandate’. On 10 February, he announced the simultaneous recruitment of two former communists (M. Androulakis and M. Damanaki, erstwhile leader of SYN) and of two former ND ministers (A. Adrianopoulos and S. Manos), who are also maligned as the main exponents of ‘neo‐liberalism’ in Greece. This sensational but disorienting move was to prove an electoral boomerang.</p>
         
         <p>Despite PASOK's frantic effort to project a novel image, the electoral outcome was a foregone conclusion. The victorious ND increased its share of the vote in practically every constituency, at the expense of PASOK. Whereas both Simitis and Papandreou shared responsibility for PASOK's defeat, the victory of ND was entirely due to its leader, K. Karamanlis, and his patient strategy. Refusing the divisions of the past and claiming the ‘middle space’ (a euphemism for the centre), this strategy effectively neutralised thirty years of PASOK propaganda demonising ND as the unchanged and unchangeable ‘Right’. Although ND also made several electoral promises that would prove hard to keep, the principal target of its campaign was the arrogance and corruption of the PASOK ‘regime’ over the previous eleven years (plus another nine from 1981 to 1989). Probably the most characteristic and persuasive pronouncement of the entire campaign was the emphatic pledge of ‘modesty and humility’ made by Karamanlis. In the end, enough swing voters were persuaded to opt for alternation. This was a victory for democracy in a deeper sense since the people's choice ran counter to the support provided to PASOK by most of the mass media.</p>
         
         <p>Among the minor parties, the KKE was content with a slight increase of its electoral support. For SYN, however, the increase was insignificant, despite repeated exercises in window dressing. It had been redefined as ‘Coalition of the Left of Movements and Ecology’ and eventually ran as SYRIZA (‘Coalition of the Radical Left’) in alliance with four inconsequential groups. For the second time, DIKKI failed to reach the 3 per cent threshold required for parliamentary representation. This prompted its founder and leader, D. Tsovolas, simply to dissolve the party, despite violent opposition on the part of some cadres who invoked the party statutes. Apparently public financing was at stake. Another one‐man show which failed to reach the 3 per cent threshold was LAOS, the new party on the far right of the political spectrum. It is the creation of George Karatzaferis, an MP expelled from ND, who first tested his appeal in the local elections of 2002 (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2003</a></span>: 966). LAOS, however, only had to wait until the European election to gain recognition and public financing.
         </p>
         
         <p>The first Karamanlis government was appointed on 10 March, and received a vote of confidence in the early hours of 23 March. Despite electoral promises to the contrary, it matched exactly its predecessor in size. The Ministry for the Press was formally abolished, but a new Ministry of Tourism was created. The new government's balanced composition created a favourable impression. It was fairly young, with the sole exception of Foreign Minister P. Molyviatis. As a trusted crony of the elder K. Karamanlis (founder of the party and uncle of its present leader), Molyviatis was the principal link with ND's past. The presence of only one woman (Minister of Education M. Giannakou) was partly compensated for by the appointment of F. Palli‐Petralia as Deputy Minister of Culture and, especially, by the election of the first‐ever female Speaker of Parliament, Professor A. Benaki‐Psarouda.</p>
         
         <p>True to his campaign statements and his own lifestyle, Karamanlis admonished his ministers against arrogance and the other temptations of office. The new government was immediately faced with three pressing problems bequeathed by the Simitis government: negotiations over Cyprus, delays in the preparations for the Summer Olympics, and the disastrous state of public finances.</p>
         
         <p>The first problem was shelved on 24 April when 76 per cent of the Greek Cypriots rejected the plan for the reunification of the island proposed by United Nations Secretary‐General Kofi Annan (while 65 per cent of the Turkish Cypriots approved it). In Greece, PASOK openly supported the plan, whereas the KKE and miscellaneous nationalists condemned it. The Karamanlis government, however, realised that it could not affect the outcome of the referendum among Greek Cypriots, which was a foregone conclusion. It wisely refrained from taking sides, and insisted that the decision was theirs to make.</p>

         <p>Coming so soon after the decisive parliamentary election of 7 March, the election to the European Parliament on 13 June was bound to evoke uncommon indifference. As many as 1.3 million citizens who had voted in March did not bother to do so again in June. This worked mostly to the detriment of PASOK and to the benefit of the new Karamanlis government. With 43 per cent, ND won the highest percentage ever received by a Greek party in a European election, while its loss of only 2.4 per cent with respect to March was the lowest such loss. Moreover, a difference of 9 per cent between the first and the second party was also the largest ever recorded in a European election in Greece. Out of the 24 Greek seats (one less than before), ND made a gain of two, while PASOK lost one.</p>
         
         <p>Otherwise, the discussion of European issues was perfunctory, once again. Only the KKE apparently benefited from its strident denunciations of the European Union, increasing its share of the vote to 9.5 per cent (but keeping the same number of seats). In sharp contrast, SYN lost 1 per cent and one of its two seats. This dismal performance prompted its leader, N. Konstantopoulos, to announce that he would not seek re‐election at the next Party Congress. Among the minor parties, LAOS was undoubtedly the most successful since it managed to win a seat (for its leader, G. Karatzaferis), and thereby also won recognition and public financing. Its chances of survival as a party on the far right of the political spectrum certainly increased. This was probably the most significant outcome of the European election in Greece, with potential long‐term consequences.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In the wake of the European election, ND held its uneventful Congress in July with 5,500 delegates who merely confirmed the leadership and reaffirmed the party's new identity as a party ‘of the middle’ (despite the consistently right‐wing profile of its members and supporters). For his part, Papandreou continued unperturbed to exploit his plebiscitary ‘mandate’. He simply abolished elected statutory bodies (Executive Bureau and Central Committee) and replaced them with handpicked transitional organs entrusted with PASOK's ‘reconstruction’ until the next Congress, which was repeatedly postponed (until early 2005).</p>
         
         <p>In August, the successful Summer Olympics held in Athens produced a rare moment of national unity and self‐confidence, which was to prove short‐lived. Despite the enormous and even wasteful expense incurred, it was suddenly realised that the Games would never ‘pay off’ (even if only to the benefit of Greek tourism). This was a painful realisation after years of exorbitant expectations cultivated by the Simitis government. More generally, the false image created by several years of ‘creative accounting’ under Simitis masked the actual state of the economy and of public finances in particular. The new Karamanlis government was forced to seek the true picture, and eventually arrived at estimates of the public deficit (at least 4.6 per cent of GDP) and of the public debt (at least 110 per cent of GDP), which not only disproved PASOK claims, but also exceeded by far the limits of the EU Stability Pact.</p>
         
         <p>PASOK retorted that the government was undermining ‘national interests’ by inviting European Union controls and sanctions. A more valid criticism was that the government's electoral promises had been irresponsible and could not be kept. Some of them were indeed reformulated and postponed. As a diversion, the government turned into a centrepiece of its programme the effort to break the nexus between public contracts and the ownership of mass media. This was an ill‐conceived scheme included in the bipartisan constitutional revision of 2001 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2002</a></span>: 967). PASOK legislation was now replaced by a stricter law, which was bound to create innumerable problems in its redefinition of a company's ‘principal shareholder’. It was also bound to discourage investment, and clash with European Union rules.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, Minister of Agriculture S. Tsitouridis was the first major victim of the new ethics proclaimed by Karamanlis. On 23 September, he was forced to resign because of the irregular transfer of his son as a student from one university to another closer to home.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, Karamanlis won a resounding tactical victory over PASOK, which was an exact replication of the tactical victory achieved at his expense by Simitis in 1999 (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2000</a></span>: 400). On 12 December, Karamanlis announced suddenly that ND would propose Karolos Papoulias as the next President of the Republic. This was a masterful move, which ended six months of speculation that the presidential election (due in February 2005) might provoke an automatic dissolution of Parliament, if it failed to muster the required 180 votes. PASOK was bound to vote for Papoulias, erstwhile Foreign Minister and trusted crony of the party's founder (A. Papandreou). The announcement also laid to rest persistent rumours that ND might propose N. Konstantopoulos. On the very same day, the fourth Congress of SYN replaced Konstantopoulos with A. Alavanos (who won 58.6 per cent of the votes). As a recent KKE cadre, the new party leader was expected to follow a ‘harder’ and more radical line that might improve the party's prospects in bilateral competition with both the KKE and PASOK.
