         <p>Roberto Calderoli, Minister of Institutional Reforms, resigned on 17 February 2006, after being accused of provoking outrage in the Islamic world having worn on television a t‐shirt bearing one of the Danish Cartoons. The consequences were especially strong in Libya where the Italian consulate in Bengasi was attacked. The Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, assumed Calderoli's post. Francesco Storace, Minister of Health, resigned on 10 March 2006, having been accused of encouraging associates to provide false signatures on the competitive list promoted by Alessandra Mussolini in the 2005 Latium regional council election in order to prevent her participation. The Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, also assumed this post.</p>

         <p>The 2006 general elections highlighted a country divided into two equal and opposite camps. The two coalitions, led respectively by Romano Prodi (centre‐left) and Silvio Berlusconi (centre‐right), collected almost the same number of votes. Discounting the votes of Italians abroad, the centre‐left won in the lower chamber (<i>Camera dei Deputati</i>) by the narrowest of margins: 19,002,598 (49.8 per cent) against 18,977,843 (49.7 per cent), while in the upper chamber (<i>Senato della Repubblica</i>) – where the minimum voting age is 25 – the centre‐right prevailed by around 250,000 votes (49.9 versus 49.1 per cent). Despite these diverging results, no stalemate occurred. The centre‐left gained the majority in both chambers thanks to the controversial new electoral law passed by the former centre‐right Government at the end of 2005. The law re‐introduced a party‐list proportional representation (PR) system with a bonus for the winning coalition in both chambers, albeit with minor, but relevant, differences between <i>Camera</i> and <i>Senato</i> (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ignazi 2006</a></span>). In the Chamber, a winner's bonus grants 54 per cent of the seats to the pre‐electoral coalition with the most votes, provided that it reaches a minimum of 10 per cent of the votes and that at least one of the parties of the coalition reaches a minimum of 2 per cent. The narrow advantage of 25,000 votes was enough to provide the centre‐left with 340 seats out of 630. The parties in the coalition gain representation only if they get more than 2 per cent (plus the largest one below that threshold). Parties that do not join any coalition and stand on their own must get at least 4 per cent to obtain representation. The same rules apply to the Senate with two variations: first, the thresholds are 20 per cent for a pre‐electoral coalition, 3 per cent for parties in the coalition and 8 per cent for parties outside it; second, the bonus (assuring 55 per cent of the seats) is not calculated on the total votes cast nationally, but <i>region by region</i>, which means that the distribution of seats might not reflect the total national popular vote.
         </p>
         
         <p>A further novelty introduced by the electoral law concerned the right of Italians living abroad to vote. They can elect 12 MPs in the <i>Camera</i> and six in the <i>Senato</i> with a plural system, and are subdivided into four constituencies: Africa, Asia and Oceania (one seat for the <i>Camera</i>, one for the <i>Senato</i>), Europe (six seats for the <i>Camera</i>, three for the <i>Senato</i>), North America (two seats for the <i>Camera</i>, one for the <i>Senato</i>) and Central‐South America (three seats for the <i>Camera</i>, two for the <i>Senato</i>). Surprisingly, given enduring stereotypes that portray Italians abroad as nationalistic and even nostalgic, and therefore supportive of the centre‐right, the centre‐left prevailed, winning seven seats (plus one independent) out of 12 in the <i>Camera</i> and four (plus one independent) out of six in the <i>Senato</i>. Thanks to this, the balance in the latter shifted in favour of the centre‐left helping it to a majority of three senators.
         </p>
         
         <p>The party system once more proved very fragmented and bipolar. More than ten parties gained parliamentary representation and no party outside the two coalitions won a seat since their share of votes was negligible (0.5 per cent for the <i>Camera</i> and 1.0 per cent for the <i>Senato</i>). This dramatic reduction, compared to almost 10 per cent gained by the third lists in the previous elections, is compatible with the new electoral law, which penalises non‐coalesced parties.
         </p>
         
         <p>Forza Italia maintained its position as Italy's largest party, with 24.0 per cent in the <i>Senato</i> and 23.7 per cent in the <i>Chamber</i>. Even if this represented a loss of almost six percentage points compared to 2001, the score was quite remarkable given that many opinion polls pointed to the party winning no more than 20 per cent. The Democratici di Sinistra (Democrats of the Left, DS) got only 17.5 per cent in the <i>Senato</i>. No comparison is possible for the Chamber because the two larger parties of the centre‐left – the DS and La Margherita (Daisy) – presented a joint list as Ulivo (Olive Tree) scoring 31.5 per cent (almost the same percentage of the sum of the two parties in 2001). The smaller centre‐right parties (Alleanza Nazionale or AN, Lega Nord and Unione dei Democratici Cristiani or UDC) increased their share of votes; in particular, the small centrist Catholic UDC doubled its size, reaching 6.8 per cent. On the centre‐left, the poor performance of the DS was accompanied by an even poorer performance by the Daisy, which lost four points, descending to just 10.7 per cent. On the other hand, the other, more radical, components of the centre‐left coalition scored quite well.
         </p>
         
         <p>The centre‐left did not achieve the clear success it longed for and which had been forecast. It performed quite well (as usual) in the red belt, and conquered three regions in the central south, but it failed to make its breakthrough in the most developed northern regions. In the north, it scored quite well in the urban areas (except Milan), but not in the densely industrialised areas outside the metropolitan areas north of the Po river. In Piedmont, for example, the centre‐left won in Turin, beating the centre‐right by 11 points, but lost in the other areas of the region. Meanwhile, the centre‐right confirmed its hold on Sicily, the north‐east and the rural areas of the north. The centre‐left recovered its appeal for the working class and maintained its hold on white‐collar workers, especially those employed in the public sector. However, it lost very heavily among the liberal professions, shopkeepers and entrepreneurs – particularly the smaller ones. Here the centre‐right reinforced its already dominant position.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> The electoral campaign and its aftermath</h2>
         
         <p>After the dramatic defeat of the centre‐right governing coalition (Forza Italia, AN, the Lega and UDC) in the 2005 general regional elections and increasing internal disputes, the Berlusconi Government was expected to expire at any moment. However, it resisted and, at the turn of the year, the political mood changed abruptly, sending the major party of the centre‐left opposition, the DS, into something of a tail‐spin. This occurred because the DS general secretary Piero Fassino was (it turned out only very tangentially) involved in a financial scandal at an insurance company, Unipol, controlled by the traditionally ‘red’ cooperative movement, Lega delle Cooperative. The affair became public during Unipol's highly contested attempt to take over the BNL Bank and was exploited ruthlessly by then Prime Minister Berlusconi to insinuate the existence of a red plot between DS politicians and ‘communist’ managers to gain control of the Italian economy. The clean, hardworking and popular image of the red cooperative movement was badly damaged, but the affair affected the DS even more. The inability of the DS leadership to react effectively to this attack and the cool response of their allies, exemplified by none‐too‐covert criticism from Romano Prodi himself, put paid to the very positive trend experienced by the party over the previous year. Its opinion poll rating collapsed to just below 20 per cent, and the party eventually ended up with just 17.6 per cent at the election itself.</p>
         
         <p>No doubt because the centre‐left appeared to be in decline, Prime Minister Berlusconi postponed the date of the election until the last possible moment, even at the cost of provoking a rift with the President of Republic with whom he had agreed an earlier date. Nevertheless, the general forecast by pundits, political scientists, pollsters and even bookmakers remained consistently in favour of victory for the centre‐left throughout the electoral campaign. Even centre‐right politicians made little attempt to mask their conviction that the elections were lost. Only Berlusconi stood out against this defeatist mood, announcing that recovery was under way and that the data of all the Italian poll institutes could not be relied upon because of their left‐wing bias. Moreover, he commissioned his own, allegedly more objective, survey, carried out by an American institute (the PSB). Apparently, its data showed that victory (albeit a narrow one) was at hand. In fact, the PSB prediction turned out to be very close to the real outcome of the elections, although it was badly mistaken when it came to individual parties' scores (the DS total, for instance, was over‐estimated by 8.4 percentage points!). All this neatly illustrates the strategy adopted by Berlusconi: to convince undecided voters that he was the victim of a ‘communist clique’ of pollsters and commentators, but that a centre‐right victory was still possible. One can interpret other moves of the Prime Minister in the same vein: the populist appeal to grassroots entrepreneurs in an overcrowded convention of the industrialists association hosted in a fiefdom of the centre‐right, and the vulgar epithets addressed to centre‐left voters in public speeches.</p>
         
         <p>On the other side, the centre‐left coalition, thanks to the new electoral law, was at last able to present a common programme under the label of ‘Unione’ (The Union). The parties joining the Unione were, in declining order, the Democratici di Sinistra (Democrats of the Left), the Margherita (Daisy), the Rifondazione Comunista (Communist Refoundation), the Italia dei Valori (Italy's Values) promoted by the famous Clean Hands prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, the Verdi (Greens), the Comunisti Italiani (Italian Communists), the Socialists and the Radicals united in the Rosa nel Pugno list (Rose in the Fist), the Udeur (a tiny Catholic party). Moreover, the two larger parties, DS and Daisy, competed in the election for the <i>Camera</i> (though not the <i>Senato</i>) with a common list strongly promoted by its candidate for prime minister, Romano Prodi: Uniti nell'Ulivo (United in the Olive Tree). The centre‐left lost support over the course of the campaign, but its decline was dramatic in the last two weeks when Prodi and the man tipped to run the Ministry of Finance made a series of very unfortunate statements about raising taxation on treasury bonds and on family donations. In addition, the last Berlusconi‐Prodi television debate was won by Berlusconi, who promised, in his very last sentence during the debate, the elimination of a residential property tax.

         <p>Election night itself generated all sorts of conspiracy theories. This was perhaps understandable given the following:</p>

                  <p>Leaving aside the fact that the exit polls were completely wrong, the final results were offered only at 2.43 am the day after the closing of the polling stations (at 3.00 pm) – meaning it took almost twelve hours to count the votes.</p>

                  <p>The number of blank votes declined dramatically from 1,707,269 to 441,791 reversing a trend of steady increase; on the other hand, invalid votes decreased much less from 1, 272.915 to 710,260.</p>

                  <p>The day after, Mr Berlusconi refused to concede and instead declared that ‘the electoral result must change’. Moreover, he went to the President of the Republic not to resign, but to ask for a decree to invalidate the results and stage a recount. The President of Republic, appalled, rejected this proposal as unconstitutional.</p>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
<p>All this encouraged rumours and fantasies of electoral fraud and bribery. During the run‐up to the election, Mr Berlusconi himself had repeatedly accused the centre‐left of bribery, while a leftist magazine offered some purported evidence of the reverse, denouncing the ‘plot against democracy’ by the Berlusconi Government. The parliamentary commission established to clear up all the doubts and questions offered no evidence at all of any fraud. Much ado about nothing, then. However, it is a sign of the deep divide between the two poles.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> The election of the President of the Republic and the nomination of the Prodi II Government</h2>
         
         <p>The almost tied result and the narrow majority of the centre‐left, especially in the <i>Senato</i>, created a climate of confrontation. The election of the <i>Senato</i> speaker was contested using all the available procedural manoeuvres, and the subsequent election of the President of the Republic left the two camps sharply divided. Although the new President (the 81 year‐old former PCI (then PDS and DS) leader, Giorgio Napolitano) was elected thanks to the votes of centre‐left MPs only, he rapidly gained general acceptance as an impartial actor. Throughout the year, however, confrontation continued to be the keynote. The narrow majority in the <i>Senato</i> was exploited repeatedly by the centre‐right in an attempt to overthrow the Government especially when the latter was forced to pass a confidence motion in order to overcome either opposition filibusters or its own internal divisions. The criticism by the centre‐right of the ‘right to vote’ of the seven life‐senators (former Presidents of the Republic and others nominated by the President of the Republic, such as the Nobel Prize winner in medicine, Rita Levi Montalcini) because of their supposed alignment with the Government symbolised the polarised climate.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Prodi II Government won a vote of confidence on 17 May. The Government made a positive start, introducing liberalising measures in certain protected economic sectors and becoming more active in the international arena, particularly in connection with the Israel‐Lebanese War. The proposal for a United Nations peacekeeping force led by European countries with Italy and France at its head represents one of the very few national successes in foreign policy. In the autumn, however, the Government lost much of its support owing to its confused presentation of the budget. In order to reverse the growing deficit and public debt, the Government raised income tax and introduced other fiscal provisions. State revenues actually increased to an unexpected extent thanks to the recovery of the economy, but also, some argued, thanks to the many tax‐evaders who were scared sufficiently by the Government's get‐tough policy to begin paying at least some of what they owed. Notwithstanding the growing economy, declining inflation and unemployment, however, the Prodi Government's approval ratings fell to a very low figure by the end of the year.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> The constitutional referendum</h2>
         
         <p>For the second time in five years Italians were called to the polls to approve or reject constitutional amendments. In 2001, the devolution reforms introduced by the centre‐left Government were approved by popular vote. In 2006, the vote concerned further changes proposed by the centre‐right Government modifying the entire institutional architecture of the state. In both cases, the referendum was called by the centre‐left – in the first case to sustain its proposals, in the second to reject the proposals of the centre‐right. In fact, the referendum held on 25–26 June was seen as an opportunity for revenge by the centre‐right, even if its coalition was not united on this issue (the Catholic UDC kept a very low profile on this issue and some of its leaders openly expressed their opposition). Yet the project failed. The outcome was massively against the reforms: 61.3 per cent voted against and 38.7 per cent in favour. Interestingly, participation was quite high compared to the previous referendum: 52.3 per cent of the electorate went to the polls as opposed to 34.1 per cent in 2001.</p>
