         <p>As compared to the previous European Parliament (EP) elections in 1999, voter turnout increased from 30.1 to 39.4 per cent. Although regional variations remained considerable, the outcome was generally seen as a success in terms of increasing interest in the EP. The pressure on the contesting parties was stronger as Finland lost two EP seats due to the Nice Agreement. This was certainly true for the small parties, with the Christian Democrats losing their representation completely. The Swedish People's Party managed to keep its sole MEP, though higher voter turnout is usually a disadvantage for them. They gained in number of votes, but their share decreased. Generally, the Swedish minority is more active in elections, which gives them an advantage when the turnout is low among the Finns. The result was a disappointment for the Greens who won more votes, but suffered a decreased share of the vote and lost one seat. Here again, the increase in voter turnout proved to be a disadvantage. The Left‐Wing Alliance won more votes, their share was unchanged, and they managed to keep their sole seat.</p>
         
         <p>The three biggest parties got 68.3 per cent of all votes cast. The National Coalition, which is the Conservative Party, was the most successful, followed by the agrarian Centre Party and the Social Democrats. The National Coalition won more votes, but lost in share; the party managed still to keep its four seats. The winners of the election were the Centre Party and the Social Democrats, who took full advantage of the higher turnout and increased their shares of the vote. If the number of MEPs had been the same as in the previous election (16), they would have stood a good chance of increasing their representation. As a result of the reduced number of Finnish MEPs, the small national parties have less chance to win office, and the big ones dominate the electoral outcome even more than before.</p>
         
         <p>In total, 13 parties nominated candidates compared to 11 in the 1999 election. The meagre chance to win office seems not to have frightened small parties from trying. All parties had the right to nominate 20 candidates, a right which was not utilised by all the smaller parties. A total of 227 candidates were nominated, of which 87 were women and 140 men. In the 1999 election, 140 candidates were nominated, of which 55 were women and 85 men. The greater number of candidates meant more attention was given to the voters, as all of the candidates had their own individual race backed by a supporter group. The campaign received more media attention than previously, although the debate still was mostly focused on the relationship between Finland and the European Union, and to a much lesser extent about the EU and its policy in general.</p>

         <p>The year 2004 in Finland was dominated by two elections: to the European Parliament, and the local elections in October. The local elections were a disappointment for the Centre Party, while the Social Democrats and the National Coalition with its new party leader, Jyrki Katainen, did well. Although the Centre Party lost its position as the biggest party in share of votes to the Social Democrats, it is still the biggest in number of councillors, as the Centre Party dominates in small rural municipalities and towns. For the Greens and the Left‐Wing Alliance, the elections were a disappointment, but the Swedish People's Party managed to reverse the negative trend from previous elections. In addition, voter turnout increased to 58.6 per cent and the share of female councillors increased to 36.4 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The enlargement of the EU with ten new Member States was accepted in Finland by the Parliament. According to Prime Minister Vanhanen, no referendum was needed and it gave fuel to only a few protests. Finland lost two seats in the EP, which raised a lot of discussion, but even this issue was accepted. Estonia is the closest new EU member, and it opened the gateway to Finns consuming and buying cheap alcohol across the Bay of Finland. The consumption of alcohol increased as a result of price cuts in Finland and private imports from Estonia. In addition, the fear of cheap labour from Estonia was a big concern for the trade unions. Finland joined those EU countries that demanded provisional regulations for a free labour market with the new Member States. It shortly turned out that these regulations did not work well as cheap labour was hired through subcontractors for Finnish firms. Movement in the opposite direction was not new, but with Estonian membership, more Finnish companies than ever before invested in Estonia or moved part, or all, of their production there. For Finnish companies, the new Member States have become welcome alternative to investing in South Asia. So far this has not had any negative implications for the unemployment rate in Finland, which has slowly been decreasing.</p>
         
         <p>Foreign policy was dominated by a security discussion. The National Coalition could not accept that Finland's defense policy is defined as ‘non‐aligned’. In reality, during 2004, Finland moved closer towards European security cooperation. The government approved an amendment to participate in two European military units, which among its critics on the left was labelled the ‘militarisation of Europe’. The reaction from Russian diplomats against closer Finnish military involvement in the West got much attention. Russia had made proposals for joint military training to prevent terrorism, but the Finnish Defense Minister, Kääriäinen, showed little interest. The closer links to NATO also irritated the Russians. The onset of a crisis was resolved when President Halonen went to St Petersburg to meet President Putin.</p>
