         <p>Mark Gosche resigned from the cabinet in May for family reasons. New cabinet member Rick Barker had been Minister of Customs outside cabinet, and retained that portfolio. He picked up the job of Minister for Courts from Margaret Wilson. Gosche had been ranked at number 17 in the cabinet. Barker entered the cabinet as the most junior‐ranked Minister, those immediately below Gosche each moving up one step. Gosche's portfolios were divided among more experienced ministers. There had been some expectations of a wider cabinet reshuffle, but Prime Minister Helen Clark signalled that she intended to wait until early 2005 to make any major changes. Two further ministers outside cabinet were appointed (making a total of seven). Another MP was appointed as a parliamentary private secretary.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The Labour‐led Government continued its domination of New Zealand politics throughout 2003. According to polls, Labour began the year with over half the electorate supporting it. By December, its poll backing had declined to a still healthy 45 per cent. In October, the opposition National Party removed its leader, Bill English, and replaced him with former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Don Brash. Brash had only entered Parliament the previous year. However, National still remained politically uncompetitive at year's end, polling at best 31 per cent immediately after the leadership change. Political commentators continued to perceive the National Party to be adrift, allowing Labour to control the political agenda to some extent by default. More effective opposition appeared to be coming from the smaller centre‐right parties, New Zealand First and Act. Nonetheless, Labour's gloss was showing signs of coming off. A total of 47 per cent polled at the beginning of the year preferred the leadership of Prime Minister Helen Clark, compared to a significantly lower 38 per cent by December (One News‐Colmar Brunton, 2003).</p>
         
         <p>Labour's political strength was underpinned by the continuing success of the economy, which registered 3.4 per cent GDP growth over the calendar year, one of the fastest rates in the OECD, although as critics pointed out, not fast enough to move the country significantly back up in the comparative ranking of national wealth and prosperity. Unemployment also edged down to below 5 per cent during the year, another key indicator of economic virtue. Labour's mid‐year budget continued a track record of fiscal prudence, but more resources were put into health, education, state housing, research and small business, all in keeping with the Government's economic growth and social policy priorities. Business commentators lamented that the Government lacked a strategy to bring New Zealand back into the upper ranks of the world's rich countries, by which they meant a commitment to lower business and personal taxes. Labour's defenders pointed to its strategy of fiscal prudence combined with significant investment in previously neglected areas such as human capital and infrastructure, and in targeted assistance to emerging export industries. Meanwhile, the Government pressed ahead with an increase in annual leave entitlements from three weeks to four, although this was not to take effect until after the next election. It also introduced amendments to industrial law to strengthen trade unions’ legal leverage, by international standards still limited for a developed economy. Understandably, business interests did not react well to either initiative.</p>
         
         <p>Foreign policy merged with economic growth as a major theme in New Zealand politics in 2003. New Zealand did not support the United States’ invasion of Iraq, thus parting company not only with the United States, but also with Britain and Australia, all traditional allies. The linkage with economic growth came in the form of negotiations between Australia and the United States on a free trade agreement, from which New Zealand was excluded. Critics of the Government pointed out that support for the United States in Iraq might have facilitated greater progress in New Zealand's securing of a potentially lucrative trade agreement with the United States. To the Government, the two issues were separate, and it could find no case for war. It considered that peaceful and diplomatic means, if followed, would have continued to be effective in dealing with Saddam Hussein's regime. Nevertheless, there was much pressure applied, internally and externally, for the Government to fall into line with the United States‐led coalition. The Government consulted closely with other sceptical governments, notably Canada and Chile, and the Prime Minister was careful to express New Zealand's position in terms least likely to offend the United States.</p>
         
         <p>The delicacy of the situation could be seen clearly in the reaction to the Prime Minister's off‐the‐cuff comments to a journalist at the end of March. Having worked as a political scientist in her early career, Helen Clark has a tendency to veer into political analysis in her public statements, and expressed the view that the Iraq invasion would not have happened under a Gore presidency, and that forces in the Bush administration ‘always wanted to go after Iraq and September 11 tipped the balance’. This interpretation of the situation was far from original – and has subsequently been reinforced by further evidence. Yet it was seized upon by the National and Act parties, given extensive publicity, and thus brought to the attention of the Bush administration, which found it offensive, one United States government spokesperson describing it as ‘a personal attack’. Few comments by a New Zealand Prime Minister can have had such apparently close attention in Washington. As a means of putting further pressure on the Government, the United States’ unusual sensitivity to the comments was effective, and the Prime Minister issued letters of apology. After the end of formal hostilities in Iraq, New Zealand agreed to commit non‐combatant army personnel to help with the country's reconstruction.</p>
         
         <p>The refusal to take part in the hostilities in Iraq had strong support in public opinion, and the American pressure and reaction, if anything, probably hardened support for the Government's position. Yet continued criticism of her lack of wisdom in making the offending comments dented Clark's credibility. When the United States and Australia announced the outline of their trade agreement later in the year, New Zealand still stood on the sidelines, although future negotiations had not been ruled out. However, the agreement's failure to significantly open up the United States market to Australian meat and dairy products underlined the extent to which the benefits of a similar hypothetical agreement for New Zealand were being oversold, and emphasised the power of veto players in the United States to effectively defend their interests even when the other party to the agreement was such a close and loyal ally. Near the end of the year, it was announced that talks would begin shortly on a trade and economic framework between New Zealand and China, leading towards a free trade agreement that could be of even greater advantage to New Zealand than one with the United States.</p>
         
         <p>The international climate provided the framework for continued concern about immigration, and particularly the handling of refugees. Algerian Ahmed Zaoui arrived in New Zealand in December 2002 without documentation and requested recognition as a political refugee. A former Islamist member of the Algerian Parliament that was dissolved after a military takeover, he was identified by the Security Intelligence Service (SIS) as having links with a terrorist organisation. Zaoui denied this charge, he and his supporters alleging that the intelligence information supplied to New Zealand could not be relied upon given its sources in an Algerian government still tainted with a refusal by the country's military to accept the results of a democratic election. Pursuit of his case through the courts continued throughout the year, with Zaoui remaining in prison under conditions that were said to be undermining his health and well‐being. Meanwhile, the Inspector‐General of the SIS, charged to review the case, made public comments considered by many to be prejudicial to Zaoui's case, and in December the High Court ruled that the Inspector‐General had erred both in making his comments and his interpretation of the criteria he was applying to the case. All this raised obvious issues about the appropriate balance between human rights and protection against terrorism. The affair was viewed with particular concern among members of the Labour Party, the union movement and the Green Party, with the Government powerless to intervene in the legal process to resolve the problem.</p>
         
         <p>New Zealand's place in the wider world, in this case relating to one of the last remaining relics of its colonial origins, also shaped another major debate in 2003. The Government took steps to remove the Privy Council in London from its role of court of final appeal in the New Zealand justice system. Most Commonwealth countries had broken this link years ago, without great controversy, and it was therefore surprising to many observers that the change turned out to be opposed so strongly by the National and Act parties. Indeed, a National Government had taken steps to begin the process some years earlier. Three main grounds were stated for the opposition. First, the creation of a new Supreme Court would lead to the appointment of judges politically approved by the current Minister of Justice, Margaret Wilson. Second, it was alleged that such a major constitutional change ought to be the subject of a referendum. While there is precedent for referendums to be held in New Zealand on major electoral matters, this provision is confined to sections of the Electoral Act, and other major constitutional changes such as the abolition of the Upper House of Parliament have in the past been made by Parliament alone. The opposition raised an issue worthy of debate, but there was no precedent or obvious requirement to use a referendum on the matter of the Privy Council. Third, the change was seen as paving the way towards republicanism. The Government stood firm, and the legislative changes passed through the House on a majority vote. The Government took the view that New Zealand should break the tie to confirm its status as an independent nation. It also made the case that the Privy Council could no longer be relied upon to consistently deliver judgements taking account of New Zealand circumstances.</p>
         
         <p>Judges were appointed to the Supreme Court accordance with the usual practice in New Zealand. The Attorney‐General made recommendations to the Governor‐General on the basis of official consultation and advice, not political or partisan approval. All those appointed were chosen from the senior ranks of the Courts of Appeal, and had been appointed to that court when the National Party had been in government.</p>
         
         <p>The most far‐reaching domestic news of the year was a metaphorical bombshell, in the form of a judgement from the Court of Appeal that the Maori Land Court could consider claims from Maori traditional organisations to ownership of the seabed and foreshore, hitherto assumed to be owned by the state (in New Zealand terms, ‘the Crown’). These claims arose from concern among Maori that they were being excluded from the increasing lucrative aquaculture industry, and that areas in which they had traditionally exercised customary rights were being taken over for that purpose. Negotiations on that matter were continuing, but the legal judgement rapidly overshadowed it. In its judgement, the Court of Appeal attempted to assist the Government in developing a response, by indicating that it did not consider that the criteria to be applied for Maori to gain title to foreshore or seabed would apply except in relatively rare situations. However, the Government appeared to panic, and interpreted the judgement as a threat to New Zealanders’ much cherished rights to visit and enjoy the seashore. It also expressed concern about uncertainty over the title to these assets, and the implications for the aquaculture industry. The Government therefore announced its resolve to legislate to confirm public ownership, a position also supported in general terms by National, New Zealand First and the United Future parties.</p>
         
         <p>The response from Maori was strong and dramatic. Maori are predominantly Labour voters, and Labour's parliamentary team contains a significant number of Maori, including seven elected from Maori constituencies. Internal negotiations within the Labour parliamentary caucus were intense. Meanwhile, among Maori in general – and among some New Zealanders of other ethnicities, on the matter of principle – there were obvious grounds to oppose the nationalisation of potential Maori property rights. The foreshore and seabed debate stabbed a sensitive spot in Maori consciousness. It has the potential to mobilise and unite Maori as never before. At year's end, a succession of events that might transform New Zealand politics was only in its beginning.</p>
