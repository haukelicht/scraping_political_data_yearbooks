         <p>Elections to the European Parliament (EP) took place on 13 June. The media genuinely focused on the election for less than two weeks. As a result, opinion polls carried out at the beginning of June revealed that a large number of voters were completely unaware that an election was to be held, and a significant percentage of the electorate could not name any of the 142 candidates. Moreover, as it was the first‐ever Sunday election in Denmark, there was uncertainty regarding the voter turnout. Popular interest in the election and anticipated voter turnout therefore became independent themes in the election coverage.</p>
         
         <p>Regardless of how often it was pointed out that the EP received greater powers and increased influence on the legislative process in the European Union (EU) – thereby exerting greater influence over the daily lives of the electorate – interest remained unchanged. There were no individual issues capable of mobilising voters. In keeping with the previous election in 1999, cheating and fraud in the EU, allowances for travel expenses, MEPs’ salaries, their absence from parliamentary meetings, the EU bureaucracy, and so on, occupied their usual prominent position in the debate. The election debate also included the future of the relationship between Turkey and the EU, increased environmental measures, agricultural subsidy reform, and positions for and against the new EU constitution.</p>
         
         <p>As opinion polls prior to the campaign had demonstrated unequivocal support for continued Danish EU membership, the ‘for or against the EU’ theme did not occupy as prominent a position in the debate as it had in earlier EP election campaigns. The previous elections had taken place shortly after referenda had been carried out, meaning that debate was extremely polarised into ‘yes‐no’ terms. By now, four years had passed since the referendum on the euro. For that reason, one of the explanations for the election result was the fact that, for many, their vote was more a function of their ordinary political orientation than a reflection of whether they were for or against the EU. This hurt the June Movement and the People's Movement Against the EU. Moreover, the exceptionally short duration of the election campaign was also detrimental for them as they were not able to improve (as they had in the past) on their poor starting point, which resulted from the lack of daily media exposure in the domestic political arena.</p>
         
         <p>Because of the EU expansion, Danish representation in the EP was reduced from 16 to 14 seats. Consequently, it was a foregone conclusion that some parties would lose seats. Voter turnout was 47.9 per cent – slightly less than in 1999. The June Movement lost two seats and the People's Movement Against the EU just barely held onto their single seat. These two parties, together with the Danish People's Party, formed the opposition to the EU. Together, the three parties won 21 per cent of the vote, a loss of 8 per cent since 1999. All in all, one of the clear results of the election was that opposition to the EU had been significantly weakened.</p>
         
         <p>In a number of other EU countries, the parties in power suffered defeat. The election result was therefore interpreted to be the verdict of the electorate against the government of the day. There was hardly a basis for such an interpretation in Denmark. While one of the governing parties, the Liberal Party, did indeed lose two seats and the Social Democrats gained two, the Liberal's losses can be ascribed largely to the fact that the party did not have any names on the ballot that were known from the national political scene. In the past, being a ‘known face’ has proven to be a decisive factor. Personal votes always play a very significant role as Denmark constitutes a single electoral district in EP elections and 82 per cent of all votes cast were personal votes.</p>
         
         <p>The advances made by the Social Democrats offered clear evidence of the significance of personal votes. With a record number of votes – 408,000 personal votes – former Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen accounted for 66 per cent of the party's total vote. In addition to being extremely well known, the massive support for Rasmussen likely also represented an expression of sympathy in the wake of his being ousted as the leader of the Social Democrats in 2002. It would therefore be an over‐interpretation to regard the election results of the two parties as indications of support – or lack thereof – for their general policies, thereby attributing the direct significance of domestic policy to the result. Indirectly, the result obviously had psychological consequences for the respective organisations and representatives – it is more satisfying to continue one's efforts on the basis of victory than defeat.</p>
         
         <p>As the June Movement and the People's Movement Against the EU do not run candidates in national parliamentary elections, Denmark previously had two party systems: one contesting European elections and another the elections to the <i>Folketing</i>. In previous EP elections, the June Movement and the People's Movement Against the EU lists combined received the support of approximately 20–25 per cent of the electorate. This support was now reduced to 14 per cent. The most important result of the election was the fact that the party composition in the <i>Folketing</i> and Danish representation in the EP were brought more into accord with one another than had previously been the case. The ‘yes‐no’<i>problematique</i> was reduced in relation to ordinary party‐policy positions.
         </p>
         
         <p>Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen wanted to arrive at a national position about the EU constitutional treaty that should include, in addition to the Social Democrats, the Social Liberal Party and the governing parties, the Socialist People's Party. The last time a national compromise of such magnitude had been reached was immediately after a majority of Danes voted ‘No’ to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 – at the encouragement of the Socialist People's Party, among others. At the time, it was judged that the participation of the Socialist People's Party in this compromise was one of the significant factors in deciding that the Danish people voted ‘Yes’ to the subsequent referendum on the Edinburgh Agreement in 1993, which included four so‐called ‘opt‐outs’. In the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, the Socialist People's Party had unsuccessfully recommended a ‘No’, whereas in the referendum regarding Danish accession to the euro in 2000, the party recommended a ‘No’, which was the ultimate result. It was therefore felt in 2004 that the position assumed by the Socialist People's Party could play a rather decisive role in the impending referendum regarding the constitutional treaty.</p>
         
         <p>The constitutional treaty made it possible for European heads of state and governments to go from having to make unanimous decisions to being able to make decisions with a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers. The negotiations therefore concentrated on setting up a positive list for the areas where Denmark would be able to accept majority decisions in the future without special domestic procedures and possible referenda, together with a negative list including the areas where this is not the case.</p>
         
         <p>On 2 November, the Liberals, the Conservatives, the Social Democrats, the Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party arrived at a settlement about ‘Denmark in the enlarged EU’. This agreement was to be in force as long as the new constitution remained valid, and it could only be reformed if all of the parties could reach agreement. The areas where the parties involved in the settlement wished to see the EU capable of making majority decisions included the minimum levels for environmental and energy taxes, the prevention of various forms of discrimination, minimum rates for indirect taxes, decisions regarding EU multi‐year financial planning, collaboration on the evasion of taxes and duties, and administrative collaboration in this regard.</p>
         
         <p>The Socialist People's Party demanded the establishment of a kind of veto, which was accepted. The parties behind the agreement therefore had to be in accord before Denmark could accept granting authority to the EU to make majority decisions in a number of areas. This applied to social insurance for employees and social protection, the rescinding of labour contracts, representation of the collective defence of the interests of employees and employers, employment conditions for the citizens of third countries, trade agreements pertaining to the delivery of social, health and educational services, trade agreements in the cultural and audiovisual area, direct personal taxation, and the harmonisation of indirect taxes, with the exception of the minimal harmonisation.</p>
         
         <p>Moreover, after pressure from the Socialist People's Party, the parties reached agreement that the constitution ought to be subject to a referendum. The four Danish opt‐outs could be put to a vote after such a referendum. The fact that the negative list had grown longer than the positive list was a consequence of the need to protect the Danish agreement model pertaining to the labour market. The Socialist People's Party had also been active in this regard in the negotiations. All in all, the other parties demonstrated considerable flexibility to accommodate large and significant aspects of the requests presented by the Socialist People's Party. As a result of these accommodations, a ballot held by the Socialist People's Party members determined that the party recommended a ‘Yes’ vote in the impending referendum on the constitutional treaty.</p>
         
         <p>Given sober consideration, it is warranted to refer to the agreement and the result of the Socialist People's Party ballot as ‘historic’. The framework for the Danish EU debate had shifted from primarily being about ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to the EU to being more about what the EU could be used for in relation to the various ideological and political positions that the individual parties had assumed as pertains to the direction and content of European development and the Danish position within this development.</p>
         
         <p>Subsequent to decisions being made in the United States and Britain to allow independent commissions to investigate the basis for the War in Iraq, the opposition to the left of the Danish Government pressed for a corresponding investigation in Denmark. This was steadfastly refused by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen on the grounds that the Danish decision was made on the basis of totally open sources and available materials, so there was nothing to investigate. An employee fired from the Danish Defence Intelligence Service stepped forward and claimed that the Government had defied knowledge to the contrary when it claimed that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction prior to the war. His understanding was that the Defence Intelligence Service threat assessments, which he had helped write, could not serve as documentation for Iraq possessing such weapons. The demands for an impartial investigation increased. On 15 April, the Prime Minister announced that he had asked the Minister of Defence to de‐classify the Defence Intelligence Service assessment. He justified this move on the grounds that a perfectly extraordinary situation had emerged, casting doubt on the credibility of the Government. On 19 April, the confidential reports were made public, though doing so had little impact on the situation. The Government felt that it was totally and completely cleared, and it received the support of the Danish People's Party, which had supported the Government all along. The opposition did not agree.</p>
         
         <p>At the same time, the opposition accused Defence Minister Svend Aage Jensby of having broken confidentiality when he allegedly referred to a top‐secret meeting in the <i>Folketing</i> Intelligence Service Committee in a television interview. The decisive factor was that the Danish People's Party also raised doubts regarding the credibility of the Defence Minister. Ultimately, he resigned on 23 April. The concept of ‘credibility’ had again been rendered an independent matter in the political arena.
         </p>
         
         <p>Søren Gade (Liberal) was appointed as the new Defence Minister and subsequently made responsible for leading negotiations for a new defence settlement. On 10 June, the Liberals, the Conservatives, the Social Democrats, the Social Liberal Party, the Danish People's Party and the Christian Democrats arrived at a five‐year settlement with an annual allocation of more than DKK19 billion. The settlement meant that the ‘mobilisation defence’ of the Cold War era was replaced by a new ‘total defence’, and international engagement was made a higher priority. It was one of the classic broad settlements in which all of those involved expressed satisfaction with the result. In terms of party politics, the most important aspect was that the Danish People's Party was included in a defence policy settlement for the first time. Thus, the party was able to add yet another policy area to the ever‐growing list of areas over which they have gained lasting influence.</p>
         
         <p>The resignation of the Minister of Defence represented the first reshuffle in Fogh Rasmussen's Cabinet. The reshuffle, carried out on 2 August, was the direct result of the appointment of former Minister of Agriculture Mariann Fischer Boel as EU Commissioner, but it also represented an offensive move: a new team was to be put in place in good time prior to the election in 2005.</p>
         
         <p>There were no shifts in the course of 2004 in terms of the fundamental patterns of cooperation. The Danish People's Party continued to provide the necessary parliamentary support to the Government. As such, they were the only party providing support in March, when the Government implemented tax relief aimed at stimulating economic growth. It was also only with votes from the Danish People's Party that the Government was able to pass the principle legislation in the most significant reform of the Danish municipal structure since 1971. The counties were abolished and replaced by five regions. The existing 271 municipalities were to be merged into approximately 100, such that the minimal municipal size increased to roughly 30,000 residents. Only the state and municipalities could collect taxes, and there was to be a massive transfer of authority to the new, larger municipalities. The subsequent legislation – over which it remained possible for the opposition to gain influence – was to be completed in 2005, and the reform would be fully implemented in the course of 2007. The failure to gain a broad majority for the passage of such a comprehensive reform was in conflict with Danish parliamentary culture. Finally, it was again with the sole support of the Danish People's Party that the Government was able to arrive at a settlement regarding the 2005 budget.</p>
