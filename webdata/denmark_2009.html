         <p>In the autumn of 2009, the Danish Ministry of Defence attempted to block the publication of a book detailing the operations of the Jaeger Corps (<i>Jægerkorpset</i>) in Iraq and Afghanistan. The book had been written by a member of the Corps. The Ministry of Defence argued that publication of the book would be detrimental to the safety of Danish soldiers. In order to emphasise this position, the Minister told the press about the existence of an Arabic translation of the book. As it turned out, the translation was an almost unreadable automatic translation produced by a Danish Defence Command employee and deliberately leaked to the press. The Minister of Defence was subjected to ridicule and the Chief of Defence submitted his resignation.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the beginning of 2010, allegations were made that sources within the Ministry of Defence had leaked information to the press about the stationing of Danish Jaeger Corps soldiers back in 2007. The Minister and/or his spin doctor allegedly either knew what was going on or were possibly even directly responsible for the leak. In any case, the credibility of the Ministry of Defence in general and the Minister in particular were damaged to the extent that he lost his previous popularity and strong position and chose to submit his resignation.</p>
         
         <p>Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who had only replaced one minister since replacing Anders Fog Rasmussen in April 2009, had been expected for some time to put together his own team of ministers in order to obtain greater political clout. He therefore capitalised on the resignation of the Minister of Defence by carrying out a major reshuffle of his cabinet on 23 February. Here, it is worth noting that Conservative Party leader Lene Espersen became the first‐ever female Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Gitte Lillelund Bech (Liberal) became the first female Minister of Defence. There were nine women among the 19 ministers in the cabinet.</p>
         
         <p>In connection with the reshuffling of the cabinet, the Government presented its new platform: ‘Denmark 2020 – knowledge, growth, prosperity, welfare’ (‘<i>Danmark 2020 – viden, vækst, velstand, velfærd</i>’). The programme included ten political objectives and 76 concrete proposals for how Denmark could escape the financial crisis and become one of the world's ten wealthiest countries in 2020. The Government's strategy was to concentrate on convincing voters of the necessity for responsible economic policy and that the current government would be the best at leading such a policy. The renowned disagreement with respect to the elimination of early retirement as a necessary step towards ensuring the future of the Danish economy (the Liberals were against, while the Conservatives were for) was not solved with the new platform. The practically meaningless Government declaration in this regard was to pursue an active reform policy.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Danish economy was facing short‐term and long‐term challenges. In the short term, Denmark had to live up to the EU convergence criteria, which required public cutbacks amounting to several billion Kroner over the next three years. In the long term, the demographic development indicated that there would be considerably fewer people of working age and many more senior citizens in the decades to come. On that background, maintaining the existing service levels in areas such as health, education, social services and the elderly will be difficult.</p>
         
         <p>The Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party presented their joint solution to these problems on 11 May: ‘A Fair Solution’ (‘<i>En Fair Løsning</i>’). The electorate was now presented with a clear alternative to Government policy prior to the election (which must at the latest be called by November 2011). The gist of the plan was for Danes to work one more hour per week, fewer subsidy schemes for the business world, an extra tax on banks, modernising the unemployment insurance system, getting young people through the education system faster, cutting taxes on ordinary earnings and an extra tax on annual income exceeding 1,000,000 Kroner. The early retirement system would be maintained, but it would be made more attractive to delay the exercise of this option. The parties ensured that the labour movement supported their plan in principal, although detailed support had not been guaranteed. In terms of party politics, one of the interesting aspects of ‘A Fair Solution’ was that the opposition was not in total agreement; the Social Liberals had not been included in the preliminary work with the plan and therefore did not sign on.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government reacted as could be expected, pointing out how the plan would mean increased public spending and criticising it for being drafted in vague terms and generally marked by wishful thinking more than reality. The Government countered with its Recovery Package (<i>Genopretningspakke</i>) on 19 May, which aimed to freeze total public spending until 2013, suspend the automatic increases to welfare benefits and delay the implementation of tax cuts for two years. This proposal represented the surrender of one of the most high‐profile political positions the Government had held since 2001 – namely the moratorium on taxes, which had been in effect for 3,904 days. This truly signalled that there was a new prime minister at the helm.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government had to negotiate with the Danish People's Party in order to ensure majority support for the package. The Danish People's Party wanted to shift the social balance in the Government proposal to benefit those who had less. The party also called for immigration‐related spending cuts. The negotiations resulted in the dropping of the proposed suspension of the automatic increases to welfare benefits, which would primarily hit pensioners; instead, the period in which individuals could receive unemployment insurance benefits was halved from four to two years. This was met with very strong opposition from the labour movement, the Social Democrats and the Socialist People's Party.</p>
         
         <p>Moreover, the party succeeded in establishing a ceiling regarding the annual amount a family could receive in family allowance. This measure affected families with more than two children, meaning a disproportionate number of families with an ethnic minority background. Finally, the party was also able to freeze the amount allocated to foreign development aid. After the Danish People's Party had contributed to the implementation of these comprehensive and rather unpopular cutbacks, party leader Pia Kjærsgaard argued that they had demonstrated their readiness to share the responsibility of governing the country.</p>
         
         <p>The budget negotiations in the autumn could not simply follow the script from previous years as the support of the Danish People's Party alone no longer provided majority support. One of the Conservative MPs had left the party and instead joined the Christian Democrats, meaning that they were again represented in the <i>Folketing</i>. The Government had to gain his support or the support of Liberal Alliance or one of the other two independent MPs in order to secure the necessary 90 votes. As the Government was not prepared to accept the extensive tax cuts demanded by Liberal Alliance, the negotiations ended with a settlement between the Government, the Danish People's Party and the Christian Democrats. The latter needed to draw attention to the fact that they still existed and were responsible enough to be elected to the <i>Folketing</i> in the upcoming election.
         </p>
         
         <p>In keeping with tradition, the Danish People's Party enjoyed success with some of their key immigration policy issues. This time around, this included further restrictions regarding family reunification legislation: Applicants must now score a certain number of points in a system that rewards language skills, business experience and education together with a deposit demonstrating financial security. The declared intention was to limit immigration from non‐Western countries.</p>
         
         <p>The budgeted state deficit and diverse projections regarding economic development made clear for everyone – economists in particular – that it would soon become necessary to make further changes to secure the Danish economy. Attention focused on the reform or elimination of early retirement. The Conservatives applied pressure from within the Government while an increasing number from within the Liberals did the same. For the first time, polls indicated a modest majority of voters supporting gradual elimination. However, the Danish People's Party was against these measures, standing together with the Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party on this issue. Conversely, one of the other opposition parties – the Social Liberals – were the clearest advocates of eliminating early retirement altogether. As such, the political positions on this central economic question created serious rifts on both sides of the <i>Folketing</i>. This will undoubtedly be a central theme in 2011, which is an election year in Denmark, as well as the fact that opinion polls indicate that value policy no longer tops the agenda for the electorate, but rather that traditional questions regarding the allocation of resources in society along the classic left–right continuum are now deemed more important.
