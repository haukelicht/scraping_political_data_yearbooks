      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12007-sec-0002"><p>The new centre‐left government consisting of the Social Democrats, Social Liberals and Socialist People's Party that was formed in October 2011 got off to a rough start. This was due to the fact that the government platform the three parties negotiated included a number of elements that the opposition and media regarded as contravening the promises made by the Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party in their respective election campaigns. This was in part because of the influence of the Social Liberals on the government's economic policy platform, but it was the price that the Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party had to pay to get their hands on the reins of power.</p>
         
         <p>According to its platform, the government intended to establish a road toll system – the so‐called ‘payment ring’ (<i>betalingsringen</i>) around Copenhagen – in order to reduce automobile traffic in downtown Copenhagen, mitigate the environmental problems that automobile exhaust was causing, and generate more money to expand and improve the collective traffic network. During the election campaign the Socialist People's Party in particular vigorously called for such a solution. However, this proposal met massive popular opposition and created considerable internal problems in the government. The trade unions and a number of Social Democratic mayors in the municipalities surrounding Copenhagen were strongly opposed to the proposal as it would result in extra expense for their supporters to drive to Copenhagen to work. Moreover, there was considerable disagreement about the precise placement of the ring and how it would work, and revised calculations indicated that the income from it would be considerably less than first thought and that a significantly larger state subsidy would be necessary. The Social Democratic Minister of Finance would not accept this. A power struggle ensued between him and the Socialist People's Party, while the Prime Minister treaded water at one press conference after another. Ultimately, the government entirely abandoned its plans to establish the so‐called ‘payment ring’, instead allocating – in agreement with the Red‐Green Alliance – 1 billion DKK (€134 million) to the lowering of public transport prices. This signalled the surrender of one of the central planks in the government platform. The course of events demonstrated the government's fumbling leadership, revealed serious internal dissent and resulted in a defeat for the Socialist People's Party. Not surprisingly, the popularity of the government fell further.
         </p>
         
         <p>In autumn 2011 the government presented a proposal for Danish energy policy. According to this plan, half of Denmark's consumption of electricity is to be covered by wind energy by 2020, the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are to be reduced by 40 per cent by 2020 on 1990 levels, and the entire energy supply is to be covered by sustainable energy – entirely independent of coal and oil – before 2050. The proposal included additional costs for citizens and businesses of almost 6 billion DKK (€805 million), to be phased in by 2020. The centre‐right parties found that the initiative represented an excessive burden on businesses and the citizens in the form of diverse environmental tax increases, which they wanted cut in half; in contrast, the Red‐Green Alliance wanted to increase them. While the government worked for a broad agreement, the intransigence of the Liberal Party meant that for some time it appeared as though a narrow agreement with the Red‐Green Alliance was inevitable. Nevertheless, after fear spread throughout the Liberal Party's support base about not having any influence on the final agreement and after the government was able to make a number of significant spending cuts, all of the parties (the small Liberal Alliance being the only exception) were able to reach a settlement in March. In this case, while running separate negotiations with the bourgeois parties, on the one hand, and the Red‐Green Alliance, on the other, the government was able to reach a compromise that everyone could live with; it was a much‐needed victory for the government.
         </p>
         
         <p>One of the central points in the election campaigns of the respective government parties in 2011 was for Danes to work a little more – 12 minutes per week, according to the slogan – to make a significant contribution over time to achieving a better balance in the economy. The extended working hours were to be negotiated in tripartite negotiations between the trade unions, employers and the state. This construction had historically been used successfully when major socioeconomic problems had to be solved. The negotiations took place in May, on the back of cuts made to the early retirement scheme (<i>efterlønsordningen</i>) and the halving of the period of unemployment benefits, which was passed in 2011. Together with the circumstances that the social partners had already negotiated agreements that provided only minimal wage increases, the trade unions felt that they had already contributed more than their fair share. They were therefore unwilling to go along with increased working hours, which in turn meant that the government – for economic reasons – was unwilling to meet a number of the unions’ requests regarding extra measures for the education of unskilled workers together with initiatives aimed at reducing youth unemployment. This removed a high‐profile cornerstone in the government's economic policy. Both the government and trade unions were left weakened as this demonstrated the inability of the traditional collaboration between the Social Democrats and trade unions to create sustainable solutions to a significant societal problem.
         </p>
         
         <p>This breakdown put the government under serious pressure to carry out the taxation reform it had previously announced as part of its platform. The question became whether it could be carried out by reaching a broad settlement that also included the bourgeois parties or if it would have to be carried out solely with the government's parliamentary support party, the Red‐Green Alliance. The primary intention motivating the proposal presented by the government was that it should be more worthwhile to work rather than be on social assistance. This meant that it became necessary to cut the taxes on labour income rather than providing relief for groups such as students, early retirees and social welfare recipients. The Red‐Green Alliance was vehemently opposed to this, but it fitted better with the programme being pursued by the bourgeois parties as they were demanding a general reduction of the overall tax burden and significant public spending cuts.</p>
         
         <p>This led to the usual political games involving new proposals, new calculations and tactically toned political statements. In mid‐June, the government rejected the Liberals’ proposal, and the latter found it useless to continue their negotiations. It therefore appeared as though the government was going to be forced into a settlement with the Red‐Green Alliance, which would necessitate changes to central elements in its proposal. This was particularly unattractive for the Social Liberals, whereas the prospects for a ‘red settlement’ received powerful support from the rank and file in the other two government parties. After strong pressure from the other bourgeois parties and their own support base, along with ever‐increasing prospects of the government reaching a settlement with the Red‐Green Alliance, the Liberal leadership made a U‐turn and announced their readiness for new negotiations. After a mere four hours of talks, the government was able to reach a settlement with the Liberals and Conservatives.</p>
         
         <p>The Red‐Green Alliance claimed to have had an agreement with the government that merely required the approval of the party's executive committee. The government denied this, asserting that there was only an ‘outline’ and that the executive committee would have made further demands. ‘Claim against claim’, as it is said in Danish – the one's word against the other. In any case, the Red‐Green Alliance was furious. The party leadership declared – in anything but politically correct language – that the Red‐Green Alliance was no longer to be seen as the government's parliamentary support party. The government had chosen to opt for the broad settlement instead of depending on the Red‐Green Alliance executive committee.</p>
         
         <p>This settlement also created major frustrations for the Socialist People's Party. Although in 2011 it had got a hand on the reins of power for the first time in the party's history, it had actually lost votes on the previous <i>Folketing</i> election. The deeply rooted opposition culture in the party organisation had to be replaced by a culture of ‘governmental responsibility’ – a difficult transformation that takes time. It was difficult for the Socialist People's Party because for decades it had been characterised by an almost equal relationship between the parliamentarians and the members’ organisation, by considerable ‘membership democracy’, and open disagreements and debates with ‘high ceilings and great distance to the door’, as the Danes say. The longer a party finds itself from real power, the easier it is to tolerate disagreement and allow it to foment.
         </p>
         
         <p>Conversely, a government must operate as a unit that does not tolerate solo declarations and deviant voting in parliament. The ministers and parliamentary group inevitably come to play the dominant role. The party's representatives and rank and file were now confronted in earnest with how they had to deal with the challenge presented to them by the settlement on taxation. The party's support levels tumbled in the opinion polls. Some began suggesting that the right thing to do was to leave the government. Individual members of the parliamentary group declared that they would not vote for the tax settlement. The situation also contributed to widespread unrest among the Social Democrats, who reached a historic low point in the opinion polls with support from a mere 18 per cent of the population.</p>
         
         <p>The crisis within the Socialist People's Party was exacerbated when party chairman, Villy Søvndal, unexpectedly announced his resignation after seven years so that a new chairperson could position himself or herself in good time before the next election. There was no obvious successor, and Søvndal declined to recommend a candidate. Unless there was only one candidate, the new party chairperson was to be elected via a ballot among the party members. Most observers expected Minister of Health Astrid Krag to be the individual to continue Søvndal's project, which had been about reforming the party in a more top‐down direction in order to bring it to power in the government. But it was this very thing that provoked the traditional left‐wing opposition. The problem for those on the left wing was that they could not readily offer a strong candidate. This might have been possible in collaboration with the leader of the party's green wing, Minister of the Environment Ida Auken, but she was not interested in the position.</p>
         
         <p>The party's left wing was finally able to find a candidate to run against Astrid Krag: little‐known Annette Vilhelmsen. A two week long, relatively drama‐free campaign resulted in a convincing two to one victory for the upstart Vilhelmsen. This represented a crushing defeat for the former party leadership and foreshadowed problems for the Socialist People's Party in the government and for the government as a whole. The new party chairperson declared that the party's grassroots were to be included more in the political process.</p>
         
         <p>As the party chairperson, it was a given that Vilhelmsen was to have a place in the government. A minor reshuffling of the cabinet led to her becoming Minister of Business and Growth instead of Ole Sohn, and veteran Holger K. Nielsen (the former party chairman who had led the party for many years) replaced the 27 year‐old Thor Möger Pedersen as Minister of Taxation. The latter, the party's chief strategist, had become a symbol of everything that the party's left wing disapproved of, and the new party chairperson therefore sacrificed him. Subsequently, numerous prominent party representatives resigned their posts, withdrew from the party and/or became Social Democrats. The party was struggling, stretched out as it was between competition for voters from the Red‐Green Alliance, on the one side, and living up to its responsibility as part of the government in a minority coalition government, on the other.</p>
         
         <p>The bombastic declaration from the Red‐Green Alliance after the tax reform settlement that the party no longer considered itself to be the government's parliamentary support party faced a decisive test in the form of the budget negotiations in the autumn of 2012. The bourgeois parties announced that they would not save the government if it had not ensured itself a majority in the final vote on the budget. Agreements with the Red‐Green Alliance were therefore necessary. The government began the negotiations in two directions: one with the Red‐Green Alliance and the other with the Liberals. In the course of the negotiations with the Red‐Green Alliance, the latter made an important announcement that they would not join a no‐confidence vote against the government. After all, the sitting government was preferable to returning to the situation from 2001 to 2011 with a bourgeois government relying on the Danish People's Party.</p>
         
         <p>In mid‐November the government was able to reach a settlement on the budget with the Red‐Green Alliance. Essentially, the government proved able to push everything of significance through that they had proposed in August. The settlement involved a very tight budget with an increase in public spending of only 0.1 per cent, together with initiatives for support for the unemployed who had started in education, the securing of internships in corporations in the course of education programmes, investments in research and green conversion, improvements to the collective traffic network, elimination of the fat and sugar taxes in order to reduce cross‐border shopping and much more. The Red‐Green Alliance had to give up making changes to the tax settlement reached in June, and it failed to win support for a number of major, expensive proposals. The government had played its cards well – threatening an agreement with the bourgeois parties if the Red‐Green Alliance made unacceptable demands. The party was therefore only able to have a marginal influence on the result. The dissatisfactory situation for the Red‐Green Alliance was reflected in the fact that nine of the 25 members of the party's executive committee – who must approve the settlements the parliamentary group enters into – voted against the agreement. The party's credibility was seriously undermined.</p>
         
         <p>Although the government had survived its second budget and its position was strengthened to some degree, this was not reflected in improved figures in opinion polls. The government continued to struggle with internal problems after the election of the new Socialist People's Party chairperson. Minister of Cultural Affairs Uffe Elbæk was accused of nepotism in the tabloids because he had approved a number of arrangements (for a total price of €24,000) that were held at his husband's place of work. A combination of genuine harassment in the media, political harassment from the opposition and an inexperienced Minister of Cultural Affairs meant that he – for personal reasons – chose to resign his position in the cabinet in December. Elbæk was replaced by Marianne Jelved, a Social Liberal veteran MP, who had earlier served as the party chairperson and Minister of Economic Affairs for many years.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, it should also be mentioned that one of the most influential politicians in Danish politics since 2001, Pia Kjærsgaard, resigned as chairperson of the Danish People's Party in September. She had founded the party in 1995 after the break with the now‐defunct Progress Party. As opposed to the Socialist People's Party, however, the transition to the new leader was without problems, thanks to the very strong top‐down management and party discipline she had introduced. The succession was clear: vice‐chairperson Kristian Thulesen Dahl was elected the new party chairman.</p>
