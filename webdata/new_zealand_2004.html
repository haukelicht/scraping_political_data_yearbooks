         <p>The year 2005 was an election year in New Zealand, with a two‐term Labour‐led government hoping to win a third mandate to govern. Economic and distributional issues loomed large in political debate throughout the year. After some years of relatively strong growth, the economy was beginning to show signs of weakening. Calendar year economic growth was 2.2 per cent, almost half that of 2004. Unemployment remained low and by the end of the year stood at only 3.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the housing market continued to boom, with house price increases for 2005 among the highest in the OECD. Combined with easy credit, this fed a boom in household expenditure, and inflation exceeded the 3 per cent mark in the second half of the year, above the target range defined by legislation. This led the Reserve Bank to increase its official cash rate in three steps from 6.5 to 7.25 per cent in the course of the year, with interest rates following. Attracting short‐term offshore investment, such high interest rates continued to keep the value of the New Zealand dollar high. Throughout the year the high dollar fed the retail boom with cheaper than normal imported consumer goods, and in the meantime also put pressure on exporters’ returns, making their prices less internationally competitive, reducing the amount and value of exports, and thus feeding an increasing current account deficit.</p>
         
         <p>Economic debate continued to centre on longer‐term performance issues. The stronger growth of the last few years did not appear to have been based on significantly stronger economic fundamentals. Most of New Zealand's exports continue to be primary agricultural products. Attempts to develop markets for higher value products continue, but progress is slow. Successes in export diversification remained small in relation to exports in general. Wages and salaries remained low compared to those of other countries with close links to New Zealand. The country's most successful export continued to be many of its more energetic and highly skilled younger citizens who could find more specialised employment and higher salaries elsewhere. In so doing, they could more quickly repay loans taken out to fund their university degrees. Opposition parties made much of this ‘brain drain’. Debate continues on the extent to which many who were departing might return in later life, and the degree to which, regardless of the state of its economy, a small country will always lose a certain proportion of its most talented people to larger countries where opportunities are greater.</p>
         
         <p>Economic analysis by the New Zealand Institute indicated that the process of increasing internationalisation of the New Zealand economy had stalled (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Skilling &amp; Boven 2005</a></span>). The country's share of world trade was declining, and with only a few exceptions New Zealand companies were failing to invest elsewhere, thus limiting their ability to extend international leverage. Private sector expenditure on research and development remained low, and was only partly offset by public expenditure seeking to redress the balance. Business confidence declined throughout the year, companies anticipating a slower economy in the short‐term future, but the housing and retail booms continued to feed a ‘feel‐good factor’ in the population in general, so business pessimism had little traction politically.
         </p>
         
         <p>Indeed, much public debate centred on the question of what should be done with the government's much higher tax receipts, generated as the result of the economy's recent prosperity. For the opposition parties, the answer was obvious: there should be significant reductions in business and personal rates of taxation, thus freeing up funds in the private sector for investment and thus generating higher economic growth. Despite similar views prevailing among its economic advisors in the Treasury, the government rejected such a strategy as having no guarantee of the desired results. If money from tax cuts were directed more into consumer expenditure than investment, the government feared that the economy would overheat to an even higher level of unsustainable growth, force the Reserve Bank to further increase interest rates, and cause a much more considerable economic downturn in the medium term.</p>
         
         <p>The government took the view that most of its ‘surplus’ was an illusion of public sector accounting, and was needed to continue to reduce debt, invest in infrastructure and continue to fund provision for future pension expenditures. While economic development was a priority, the government believed that it was best encouraged by investing in skills development, education, research and development, and carefully targeted assistance to particular firms and industries. Meanwhile larger families on low to moderate incomes were struggling financially, incurring excessive debt due to a combination of low wages, easy credit, and the retail and housing booms, and many parents were working long hours with little time to tend to their children. While calls for tax cuts were attractive to people in this position, the opposition's policies would benefit people in low‐ and middle‐income families much less than upper‐income groups. Labour preferred a mechanism that would target those most in need.</p>
         
         <p>Delivered by Minister of Finance Michael Cullen, the government's May Budget was a careful balance of its various objectives, but a public relations disaster. Prior publicity had hinted that it contained ‘a deep dark secret’ that would position Labour well in the forthcoming election campaign, but, in fact, the Budget was an even more conservative document than its immediate predecessors – all models of fiscal responsibility. As a result of inflation, tax thresholds at successive levels of income had been gradually gathering in more revenue. The Budget proposed to reduce these, but not until 2008, and very modestly, although it did promise, from then on, to peg those thresholds to inflation. The Budget also contained announcements of programmes to encourage and reward saving for home ownership and for retirement. Most importantly, it outlined the implementation of the government's ‘Working for Families’ package, foreshadowed the year before, already reflected in increased family allowances, with more to follow in April 2006, and intended to be fully implemented in 2007. In this lay Labour's central strategy to win the election by a direct appeal to voters in lower‐ and middle‐income families. However, there was nothing in the Budget for beneficiaries, or relief for those paying back student loans. ‘Working for Families’ was existing policy, most of its benefits were still to come, and the main focus of media coverage of the Budget was on the very small changes to tax thresholds and the lateness of their implementation.</p>
         
         <p>In 2005's political discourse three related phrases recurred: ‘political correctness’, ‘nanny state’ and ‘social engineering’. These had connections to several pieces of legislation that had passed recently into law, but expressed more general concerns of people with socially conservative and/or economically liberal opinions. The laws in question included the legalisation of prostitution in 2003, provision for civil unions for couples regardless of gender, and the banning of smoking in bars and restaurants, both in 2004. More generally, there was greater public expression of views that minorities, including Maori, were being given too much attention at the expense of ‘the mainstream’. This tapped into a position already staked out the year before by National Party leader Don Brash in which he argued that current policies on Maori matters were creating division, not healing it. The government response to this current of public opinion was to remove Maori‐specific language from policy discourse, but not necessarily to change the policies. Meanwhile, any proposals for further legislation on matters of individual and social rights were put aside.</p>
         
         <p>Issues about the competence and character of political leaders were prominent in 2005. The competence of Prime Minister Helen Clark had been one of the government's key assets since Labour's assumption of power in 1999. Clark continued to poll consistently well as preferred prime minister despite occasional missteps and embarrassments that opposition parties sought to exploit. Another of these surfaced in 2005, although the events in question had taken place in July the previous year. A prime ministerial motorcade had driven to Christchurch airport so that she could attend a rugby match in Wellington, passing through several small towns while exceeding the speed limit sufficiently for numerous complaints to be made. Helen Clark denied responsibility, stating that she was too preoccupied to notice the speed of her vehicle while working on government papers in the back seat, and that the arrangements were all in the hands of the police. The police launched an investigation, and a number of the officers responsible were charged, with court proceedings taking place in August 2005, just as the election campaign was beginning. The Prime Minister was not charged or even asked to give evidence, and although correct in legal terms, her unwillingness to comment on the matter did not go down well publicly.</p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile Labour MP John Tamihere gave an interview to the editor of a conservative magazine, <i>Investigate</i>, in which he made a number of ill‐advised statements that were critical or derogatory of the Prime Minister and other members of the Labour parliamentary team. Tamihere made other comments that women, homosexuals and Jews could find offensive. He had been in hot water before. As a high profile Maori MP and potentially a key figure in Labour's future leadership, he had been targeted by the opposition, and while most of the accusations were unproven, some political mistakes were uncovered. Tamihere had been stood down from Cabinet, not reappointed, and effectively sidelined. One of Labour's more socially conservative MPs, he continued to have considerable personal support, but his interview with <i>Investigate</i> and the subsequent fallout almost certainly finished his political career. Tamihere claimed that he did not know the interview had been tape‐recorded, but faced severe recriminations from his colleagues, and was put on ‘extended stress leave’. A member for the Auckland‐isthmus Maori electorate of Tamaki Makaurau, Tamihere had been hoped to defend it strongly against the Maori Party, but this episode damaged his <i>mana </i>(prestige, influence or power), probably beyond repair.
         </p>
         
         <p>Controversy also developed over episodes in the past teaching career of Associate Minister of Education David Benson‐Pope, first appointed to Cabinet the previous year. In May, it was alleged by former students that over twenty years before Benson‐Pope had forced a tennis ball into the mouth of a student and taped his hands to a desk. Accused of bullying his students, Benson‐Pope denied the allegations in Parliament. He was stood down from Cabinet while the matter was referred to the Speaker of Parliament to determine whether or not the matter should be referred to Parliament's Privileges’ Committee. A police inquiry was also initiated. In June, the Speaker announced there was not enough evidence to refer Benson‐Pope to the Privileges Committee, and he returned to Cabinet, although no longer as Associate Minister of Education. The police investigation continued over the period of the election, and a report emerged in December. The police had found that a <i>prima facie</i> case existed for prosecution, but given the lapse of time they had decided not to proceed. A total of nine students supported the allegations, and 18 denied them or said they could not remember them. Benson‐Pope continued to deny the charges, but told his staff to leak a more favourable construction of the report's findings prior to its release, denied doing so, and then admitted it. Benson‐Pope's mishandling of the matter was, if anything, more damaging than the allegations themselves.
         </p>
         
         <p>Other issues of government competence had some traction. The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) is a senior secondary school qualification, first introduced in 2002. By 2005 numerous teething troubles had emerged. Scholarship examination results contained so many inconsistencies that action had to be taken early in the year. Teachers complained of increased workload, and parents and employers complained of lowering standards. Only the partial responsibility of the National Party for the design of the qualification and National's continued support for the principles behind it made it possible for the government to fend off the worst of the criticism.</p>
         
         <p>In June it was announced that New Zealand's estimates of surplus greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Agreement were incorrect, and a deficit was more likely. Further difficulties associated with New Zealand's commitment to Kyoto continued as forest owners continued to demand carbon credits for themselves rather than the government. The opposition parties pledged not to carry through the carbon tax scheduled for 2007, and also pledged to amend the Resource Management Act to make it easier for development proposals to overcome environmental objections. The Green Party attempted to draw attention to looming energy shortages, particularly associated with ‘peak oil’. Despite significant increases in petrol prices during the year, their arguments had little traction.</p>
         
         <p>Law and order continued to be another area of concern. While official figures suggest that in general crime is trending downward in New Zealand, small‐scale property thefts are now rarely investigated, police numbers to population are relatively low, and lack of police resources remains a matter of public concern. Centralisation of the emergency telephone ‘111’ service led to several complaints early in the year and an inquiry. With some senior police under investigation for sexual misconduct during the year, and other evidence that staff were using police computers to access pornography, management of the police portfolio remained challenging. Minister of Police George Hawkins and Police Commissioner Rob Robinson both stepped down from their positions by the end of the year.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> General election results</h2>
         
         <p>Held on 17 September, the 2005 general election proved to be closely contested. Early in 2005 Labour regained its lead in most polls, but after the May Budget, National moved into the polling lead once more. An imaginative National billboard campaign attracted much public attention before the beginning of the official campaign period, and Labour's response was late and pedestrian by comparison. By the end of August, it was unclear which major party had the advantage, with polls indicating mixed results, some showing one party ahead, some the other. However, the poll with the most public currency (One News‐Colmar‐Brunton) put Labour consistently behind from late August until the election.</p>
         
         <p>National announced in July that if able to form a government it would make interest payments on student loans tax‐deductible, a measure partly designed to reduce incentives for graduates to leave the country for higher‐paying jobs. However, a week later Labour outbid National, promising to completely remove interest on student loans for graduates remaining in New Zealand. National pledged to unveil a policy that would substantially cut taxes, but refused the release the details until the election date was announced. After the announcement of the date, National further delayed the policy release. On 19 August, Labour got in first, announcing a radical extension of the ‘Working for Families’ policies that would provide benefits for almost all working families with children, with substantial increases in tax relief at low‐income levels to the point that many two‐child families would pay no tax at all. National's policies were revealed on 22 August to be a complex mixture of tax rebates for lower‐income families with children and tax cuts that would mainly benefit those earning NZ$50,000 or more annually. Labour's working for families policies would be replaced, with many lower‐ to middle‐income families receiving less assistance than would be the case under Labour. Business taxes would fall somewhat, but not until 2008.</p>
         
         <p>Labour ran a professional, but unimaginative, campaign. National's campaign suffered from the inexperience of its leader, Don Brash. Asked to define what distinguished a ‘mainstream’ New Zealander, Brash's answers were unconvincing. Anti‐government advertising targeted against Labour and the Greens proved to be funded by the Exclusive Brethren, a conservative church whose members do not normally participate in politics. After first denying any collaboration between National and the Brethren, Brash was forced to admit that discussions had taken place. Indeed, there were claims that the Brethren had assisted National's campaign more generally on the ground. National's best performer in the campaign was Finance spokesperson John Key, who was increasingly spoken of as a future National Party leader, and perhaps as taking that role sooner rather than later.</p>
         
         <p>The smaller parties made far less impact in the campaign than in previous elections since New Zealand's adoption of mixed‐member proportional representation (PR) in 1996. Labour and the Greens campaigned as potential but not inevitable coalition partners. Green polling on or about the 5 per cent party vote threshold for representation in the months before the election meant that, at worst, they could have won no seats. Labour's other ally, the very small Progressive Party, had one secure electorate seat, but was unlikely to hold the second list seat it secured in 2002.</p>
         
         <p>National, meanwhile, campaigned without explicit allies. The Act Party, to National's right, was a potential partner, but its polling was well below the party vote threshold of 5 per cent. Its only hope was to win the Auckland electorate seat of Epsom, a normally safe National stronghold contested by its leader, Rodney Hide. In 1996 National made it possible for Act to take a seat National would otherwise have held, but was not disposed to make the same arrangement in 2005. Hide went on to win the seat of Epsom without National Party assistance and, having crossed the threshold to representation, Act was able to secure a second list seat.</p>
         
         <p>The United Future party supported the Labour‐led government on confidence and supply throughout the previous parliamentary term. Its polling was also well below 5 per cent, but its leader, Peter Dunne, held a relatively safe electorate seat. Dunne pledged initially to seek an arrangement with the party with the most seats after the election, but his personal preference was tilted to National.</p>
         
         <p>The Maori Party, formed after Labour's announcement to legislate to ensure public ownership of the foreshore and seabed against potential Maori claims to property rights, ran a strong grassroots campaign in the Maori electorates. Although the National Party receives virtually no support in the Maori electorates, the Maori Party leadership wished to keep its options open. However, the political inexperience of its leadership combined with its insistence on repeal of the foreshore and seabed legislation made it an unlikely government partner for either major party.</p>
         
         <p>The New Zealand First Party led by Winston Peters was potentially as pivotal a player as it had been in 1996 at New Zealand's first PR election. At that time, Peters campaigned against the incumbent National government, but entered a coalition with National some weeks after the election. In 2005, Peters declared that like United Future his initial position would be to seek to negotiate an arrangement to support the largest major party, but without going into coalition and thus not accepting ‘the baubles of office’.</p>
         
         <p>The election outcome was, in itself, not decisive. Labour's narrow two‐seat margin was unexpected, as by the day of the election most observers were expecting a National plurality. A major factor in Labour's victory was increased turnout in some lower‐income suburbs and, in particular, the Maori electorates – its areas of most concentrated support, where Labour campaigned strongly on its targeted tax relief and low‐income housing policies and received considerable organisational support from trade unions. Meanwhile National's championship of ‘mainstream’ New Zealand and an end to special treatment for the Maori had struck too many sour notes for it to maintain momentum. Despite National's dramatic recovery from its disastrous performance in 2002 to become a competitive major party once more, Labour had kept all but a fraction of its 2002 vote share and retained the advantage to form a government.</p>
         
         <p>Both the Greens and New Zealand First crossed the 5 per cent party vote threshold, but with National's recovery of most of the centre‐right vote, Peters lost the seat he had held for over twenty years. The Maori Party won four of the seven Maori seats, including that held by John Tamihere. This generated a one‐seat ‘overhang’ as the Maori Party would have only been allocated three seats on the basis of its party vote, which in the Maori electorates remained almost as strongly Labour as at the previous election. The size of Parliament temporarily increased to 121. Three parties receiving below 5 per cent of the party vote gained electorate seats, Act also receiving a further list seat and United Future a further two. In 2005, the 5 per cent party vote threshold had no constraining effects on the composition of Parliament. Indeed, the outcome was as proportional as it would have been in the absence of any threshold at all. Four parties secured small numbers of seats by crossing the electorate seat threshold, presenting a considerable challenge for the formation of a government with such a tight margin between the two parties.</p>
         
         <p>Labour/Progressive and their potential Green coalition partner could command 57 seats, but 61 were needed for a parliamentary majority. To add a single other party to achieve a majority, only the Maori Party or New Zealand First had sufficient seats. However, Labour and the Maori Party were almost equally averse to mutual cooperation, and despite some common positions and affinities with the Green Party, the Maori Party looked more toward the option of providing support to a National‐led government. Even if its leanings had been more to Labour, the Maori Party's lack of experience would make them an unreliable ally. Moreover, the position of the Maori Party was disastrous for the Greens as both New Zealand First and United Future indicated they would not support a government with the Greens in Cabinet. Labour continued to remain in a commanding position, however. National made a bid to put together a National/Act/United Future/Maori agreement that matched the 57 seats of Labour/Progressive/Green, and appealed to New Zealand First to join it. Although neither the Maori Party nor United Future were as firmly committed to that combination as National asserted, this clarified the situation by emphasising the pivotal position of New Zealand First.</p>
         
         <p>Labour/Progressive/New Zealand First together had 58 seats. The Green Party, excluded from government as a condition of New Zealand First support, had nowhere else to go and formally agreed to abstain on confidence and supply issues, with Labour agreeing for them to have a role in a ‘buy New Zealand’ campaign and in encouraging the greater use of solar energy and public transport. This meant that 58 votes would be enough for a Labour‐led government to prevail. However, seeking to broaden her support still further into the centre, Helen Clark also offered a role to the United Future Party, thus extending her guaranteed support to 61.</p>
         
         <p>The arrangement that emerged was unusual. The 21‐member Cabinet contained only Labour members and the one Progressive: Jim Anderton. United Future and New Zealand First entered into ‘enhanced confidence and supply’ agreements that gave each party a ministerial position outside Cabinet. Dunne became Minister of Revenue on the basis of policy concessions that would probably involve the scrapping of the proposed carbon tax and put a reduction of business taxes firmly on the government's agenda. Most controversial was Peters’ assumption of the portfolio of Minister of Foreign Affairs, an unusually senior role for someone not a member of Cabinet. Accepting a ministerial position that he had made a commitment not to seek during the campaign also gave Peters some difficulties both within his party and in the wider context of public opinion. Policy concessions to New Zealand First included a significant increase in police recruitment, enhanced benefits for retired people and renewal of the law that forces MPs leaving their parties to leave Parliament as well. In return, on top of confidence and supply, both support parties agreed to vote for Labour's retirement savings plan, extensions to the ‘Working for Families’ package and the ending of interest on student loans for people remaining in New Zealand – the latter two being Labour's key campaign policy commitments. Due to the greater call on government expenditure required by agreements between the various parties, the government set up a review of existing programmes to identify areas where savings might be made. Outside of the policy agreements made during the government formation negotiations, collective responsibility would apply to Dunne and Peters only in the areas covered by their own ministerial positions.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>The only significant change to the Cabinet before the 2005 election was the resignation of Margaret Wilson to assume the job of Parliament's Speaker at the end of February. Her portfolios were assumed by other Cabinet members. David Benson‐Pope was briefly stood down from Cabinet in May, but returned, shedding his secondary responsibilities as Associate Minister of Education. Despite an ongoing police inquiry into allegations about his behaviour in his former career as a teacher, he was re‐elected to Helen Clarks's third Cabinet and given the important portfolio of Minister of Social Development.</p>
         
         <p>The appointment of Helen Clark's third Cabinet after the 2005 election provided a much‐needed opportunity to renew the government as it began its third term. There was some potential for regeneration, but there was little opportunity to extend it into the higher levels of the government's leadership. The government had gone to the country with an 18‐member Cabinet, two below the norm. Three ministers did not stand for re‐election to Cabinet, leaving five vacancies. As it happened, the Cabinet ended up with 21 members because of the position of Jim Sutton, a highly effective and respected Minister of Trade Negotiations since 1999. Like a number of Labour MPs, Sutton had lost his electorate seat, but remained in the House as a list member. However, in the aftermath of the election it was clear that some of these list MPs, particularly those in older age brackets, might be expected to retire in order to refresh Labour's parliamentary team for the future. Because of his value and contribution to a critical portfolio, Sutton was reappointed to Cabinet, but with a much‐reduced ranking and offers of diplomatic postings were made that he did not accept. At year's end, he stepped down as Minister of Trade Negotiations, but remained in Cabinet, retaining the role of Minister of State with special responsibility for Doha negotiations.</p>
         
         <p>Lianne Dalziel, who had been obliged to resign as a minister in 2004, was returned to the new Cabinet, leaving five positions for genuinely new entrants. Damien O’Connor and David Cunliffe served as Ministers outside Cabinet in the previous term, but David Parker, Nanaia Mahuta and Clayton Cosgrove had no previous ministerial experience. Parker, the most junior of these, first elected in 2002, is regarded as having the most potential. Of these new ministers, Parker (Energy), Cunliffe (Communications) and O’Connor (Corrections) had potentially challenging roles, but the main centre of gravity in the Cabinet remained, with only one or two omissions, where it had been in 1999 when the fifth Labour Government took office: the senior leadership team of Clark, Cullen, Anderton, Maharey, Goff, King, Mallard and Hodgson.</p>
