<section class="article-section article-section__full"><section class="article-section__content" id="ss1"><p>The year 2009 played an important role in the sequence of events which will drive France towards the 2012 presidential and legislative elections. The rising and persistent unpopularity of Nicolas Sarkozy (who was significantly less popular than the Prime Minister) reached a fairly high level at the end of 2009. According to a SOFRES survey conducted in December 2009, only 34 per cent of the French population said that they had confidence in Nicolas Sarkozy as President. The unpopularity of the French President added to some difficulties with cabinet cohesion and to public controversies either directly related to Nicolas Sarkozy (the possible election of Jean Sarkozy, the President's son, to the public authority in charge of the business centre La Défense in Paris) or to its ministers' choices (the controversy after the support given to Roman Polanski by the newly appointed Minister for Culture) made 2009 a fairly difficult year for the French President. One of the few sources of satisfaction for the executive was the UMP victory in the European Parliament (EP) elections, since the UMP took 27.8 per cent of the vote, beating the Socialist Party (PS) by 11.3 points. The low level of turnout for the EP elections in France, however, limited the relevance of this victory, even if it was a clear victory.</p>
         
         <p>On the public opinion side, pessimistic views about the economic context and economic prospects during and after the banking system and financial crisis deeply characterised 2009. A survey conducted at CEVIPOF in Sciences Po in December 2009 documented that the lack of trust in mainstream political families (confidence in the right and in the left to run government) had returned to 2006 levels, as if the ‘Sarkozy effect’ was no longer there at all: 65 per cent of respondents said that they did not trust either left or right. It was in this difficult context that the French President announced and later proposed more precisely a major plan to support sectors able to generate jobs and innovation, supported by a huge public spending programme (announced in the autumn of 2009 as an ambitious programme for infrastructure developments with a budget of €35 billion, with two‐thirds coming from a loan and one‐third from the reimbursement by the banks of their public budget support).</p>
         
         <p>Not unconnected to this socio‐economic and political context, the François Fillon Cabinet was reshuffled on two occasions in 2009, and these were more than just technical adjustments. Some commentators may refer to these cabinets as ‘Fillon II’ and ‘Fillon III’, but it is more precise to name it “Fillon IV” and “Fillon V”, since minor changes in the Fillon cabinet composition already happened on two occasions before 2009. This was also a year of great importance for the left and in particular for the Socialist Party, recovering from the disaster of the Reims Congress and the designation of Martine Aubry as the PS leader after a very confused election, contested by Ségolène Royal as unfair and riddled with irregularities.</p>
         
         <p>The first cabinet reshuffle (January) was primarily related to a series of reorganisations within the presidential majority, including the departure of Xavier Bertrand from the French cabinet and his appointment as head of the UMP (the majority party supporting the government and president), a role change strongly driven by Nicolas Sarkozy personally. Some changes in ministerial positions were of great importance in this first reshuffle: Eric Besson, former Minister for Economic Forecasting and the Digital Economy (a position that Nathalie Kosciusko‐Morizet left against all expectations since as Minister for Ecology she was held in high esteem in environmental milieux) became Minister of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co‐development, while Brice Hortefeux (one of the ministers closest to Nicolas Sarkozy) who had previously held that position became Minister for Labour and Social Relations. This element is fairly important since 2009 was also marked by the so‐called ‘national debate on national identity’– a public debate organised at the local level by Eric Besson and his administration with the support of Nicolas Sarkozy (there were to be important controversies about this debate and its political motivations). This debate (‘<i>le Grand débat sur l'Identité nationale</i>’) was also developed through an official website, which received about 20,000 contributions (a moderated site, but showing incredibly violent opinions) and also took place in a context of public debates about the burka.
         </p>
         
         <p>Some other adjustments to the different ministerial positions are also worth noting, such as the extension of the ministerial competences of Martin Hirsch to youth issues, a reward for him (a top civil servant and former president of a famous civil society association helping poor and homeless people, who had accepted a mission in the Fillon Cabinet but had left‐wing orientations) after the implementation of the RSA (<i>revenu de solidarité active</i>) – a benefit paid to those on low pay which replaced the RMI (<i>revenu minimum d'insertion</i>); the clear separation of the ministerial competences of Christine Boutin and Fadela Amara; the nomination of Chantal Jouanno, a key figure from civil society (President of the Agency for Environment and Energy Management) who joined the government as Minister for Ecology. This first 2009 cabinet reshuffle was not merely technical; it was the consequence of the efforts of Nicolas Sarkozy to improve the organisation of the majority and to end dysfunctions between ministers which were becoming quite visible. Faced with this restructuring, the UMP majority party initiated a decisive turn. Patrick Devedjian left the post of secretary‐general of the UMP to be replaced by Xavier Bertrand. This appointment was strongly supported and more than encouraged by Nicolas Sarkozy, who was very concerned to give new life to the UMP, whose numbers had declined (down 100,000 members compared to 2007).
         </p>
         
         <p>The second reshuffle took place after the EP elections, won by the UMP, and also after a speech by Nicolas Sarkozy to the Congress (Senate and National Assembly joined in a special session organised in Versailles), delivered on 22 June. (This presidential address was a first under the Fifth Republic and was part of the constitutional amendment of 21 July 2008 according to which the President can speak to the Congress, without a vote or debate with the President). This second cabinet reshuffle was first imposed by the EP election results since two ministers, Rachida Dati and Michel Barnier, were elected as MEPs. It was more extensive than the first one. Some ministers were clearly sanctioned for the mismanagement of their activities or for either personal or cabinet controversy in which they were involved: Roger Karoutchi, André Santini, Bernard Laporte, Yves Jégo (who had supposedly mishandled the social tensions in Guadeloupe in February), Christine Boutin and Christine Albanel left the government. Within the new government, an ‘icon’ from the beginnings of the presidency now seemingly in disgrace with Sarkozy was Rama Yade, who had opposed the will of the President to see her as a candidate in EP elections and who had marked her difference with him during the visit to France of the Libyan President. Yade lost her post as Minister for Human Rights and became Minister for Sport.</p>
         
         <p>Other important changes in ministerial positions took place: Brice Hortefeux became Minister of the Interior, a key position in a context where the issue of security and the fight against illegal immigration once again became a priority on the President's agenda; Michèle Alliot Marie, former Interior Minister, succeeded Rachida Dati as Minister of Justice (while the legal community was very opposed to different reform projects of Rachida Dati); Xavier Darcos left National Education for the Minister of Labour; and Luc Chatel replaced Xavier Darcos as Minister of Education. Finally, this reshuffle had important political implications in terms of the management and enlargement of the majority: new ministers from the UMP parliamentary group entered the government (Benoist Apparu, Pierre Lellouche) in a context of some slight tensions between the executive and the chairman of the UMP group in the National Assembly (Jean‐François Copé), while the new government made two very symbolic appointments: Michel Mercier, a centrist senator and MoDem Treasurer entered government as Minister for Rural Affairs and Territorial Planning (a very hard blow for François Bayrou), while Frédéric Mitterrand (nephew of the former French President) became Minister of Culture.</p>
         
         <p>On the left, 2009 was mainly characterised by the beginning of a logic of appeasement of the internal tensions in the Socialist Party, following the 2008 Reims Congress. At the beginning of the year, Martine Aubry proposed that the ‘Royalists’ should join the national bodies of the party: on 24 February, ten Socialist leaders close to Ségolène Royal were incorporated into the party leadership. However, three prominent names among those who most supported Ségolène Royal during the campaign of 2007 (Manuel Valls, Vincent Peillon and François Rebsamen) refused to join the party leadership and declared their intention to create a group within the party while Royal declared that she was ready to take her place within the leadership of the party. Some months later a degree of tension between Ségolène Royal and Martine Aubry went back to the time of the publication of a book written by two journalists and documenting the amount of fraud (on both sides) during the 2008 internal election of the leader of the PS. The poor results of the PS in the EP election and the remnants of the internal divisions encouraged Martine Aubry to take the initiative of an important renewal project: to improve the management of the PS direction and, most importantly, to organise a vote (avoiding the dysfunctions of the 2008 vote) asking the PS activists to pronounce in a questionnaire (12 questions elaborated by a group representing all the tendencies within the PS) on major changes in the PS organisation, on political issues and on the organisation of primaries (‘<i>les primaires à la française</i>’) to select the PS candidate for the 2012 presidential election.
         </p>
         
         <p>The vote was organised on 1 October: out of about 200,000 socialist activists, 92,342 participated (45.95 per cent). Of the different questions, the ending of multiple office‐holding (<i>cumul des mandats</i>) was approved by 72 per cent, the organisation of primaries (open to all citizens and to any other left party agreeing to register and participate in the selection of the PS candidate and approved by the PS leadership) by 68 per cent and parity by 71 per cent. The organisation of the primaries, their calendar (François Hollande asking for their early organisation in 2010/2011, while for obvious reasons socialist leaders close to Dominique Strauss‐Kahn were asking for a late organisation) and democratic control of the process were hotly discussed within the party. The different actions of Martine Aubry in taking the PS back to its strong opposition role and in addressing the issue about the internal democracy of the party were motivated by her wish to affirm her leadership and her legitimacy, but also by the urgent need to respond to the results of the EP elections, which were not only marked by the clear defeat of the PS and the victory of the UMP but also by the very high national score of Europe Ecology – a leftist coalition that won 16.28 per cent of the vote by adding candidates from the far left (such as José Bové), associations (Karima Delli) and civil society (Eva Joly) to the list presented by the Greens. Europe Ecology's score was nearly nine points higher than that of the Greens alone in 2004, raising the issue of whether the PS would be able to maintain its leadership on the left.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the extreme left, 2009 also played an important role, with the creation of the NPA, the ‘anti‐capitalist party’, by Olivier Besancenot from the old LCR (<i>Ligue communiste révolutionnaire</i>) and the official creation of the <i>Parti de Gauche</i> by Jean‐Luc Mélanchon, a former leftist PS leader who announced his resignation from the PS in November 2008. The NPA plan is surely not to join a left‐wing coalition run by the PS, and the NPA made clear from its beginning that the ‘no‐alliance’ with the PS was a key point of NPA strategy. This is an important element since one of the big issues for the French left concerns the electoral strategy of parties to the left of the PS: the PCF and the <i>Parti de Gauche</i> have an electoral strategy together (the <i>Front de Gauche</i>) and at the same time are engaged in a renewal of the old union with the PS.
         </p>
         
         <p>The extreme right of the political spectrum was, in 2009, dominated by the future succession of Jean‐Marie Le Pen, the position of the FN leader being challenged by his daughter, Marine Le Pen, and Bruno Gollnisch (presented for a long time as his legitimate successor by Jean Marie Le Pen himself). In the EP elections, the National Front (FN) scored 6.34 per cent – a drop of 3.5 points as compared to the 2004 elections. Another interesting factor on this side of the French political spectrum is the weak score of the Movement for France (MPF: 4.8 per cent of valid votes, in alliance with the Hunters' party) – the sovereignist party of Philippe de Villiers, who managed to be the only MEP elected in Europe under the Libertas umbrella.</p>
         
         <p>In conclusion, 2009 can be considered as a key period, particularly regarding the first elements of a context framing the prospects for the 2012 elections: the re‐affirmation by Nicolas Sarkozy of immigration and national identity issues, the changes in the PS and the strengthening of Martine Aubry's leadership, the confirmation of Europe Ecologiy's importance as the second left force and the future of the FN leadership – all of these elements have been important for the political agenda in 2009.</p>
