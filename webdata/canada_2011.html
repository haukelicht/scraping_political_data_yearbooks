         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy5-sec-0002-title"> Issues in politics: An election year</h2>
         
         <p>For seven long years since the general election of 2004, Canadian national politics had been bedeviled by the politicians' failure to work a Parliament in which no single party held a majority. Relationships among the parties deteriorated and became increasingly acrimonious after the Conservatives formed minority governments in 2006 and then again in 2008. The government twice resorted to proroguing Parliament in order to avoid a negative vote and the Speaker twice ruled that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case that the government was in contempt of Parliament. When the Commons Committee on Procedure and House Affairs found the government in contempt – the first time this had happened in the history of the British Commonwealth – its days were numbered. It was hardly surprising, then, that when the Conservative government finally fell, prompting the country's 41st general election on May 12, it was not on a substantive policy issue but on the fundamental question of the government's treatment of Parliament.
         </p>
         
         <p>The opposition Liberal Party sought to make respect for Parliament and the political process a major issue, but the government countered by arguing that voters were really faced with a choice between a Conservative majority or an ‘illegitimate coalition’ of opposition parties, including the ‘separatist’ Bloc Québécois. As in past elections, the national campaign quickly dissolved into a series of distinctive regional contests marked by different constellations of opponents, leadership appeals and policy preferences. When it was over, the Conservatives had their majority – the first Conservative majority since 1988. It appeared to be a major step in Prime Minister Harper's dream of replacing the Liberals as the country's natural governing party.</p>
         
         <p>However, the Conservatives managed their victory not by any significant increase in their vote share (it grew by only 1.4 per cent), but by an improved vote/seat ratio in the province of Ontario from where all its seat gains came. So, despite their dramatically changed position as undisputed masters of the new Parliament, the election appeared largely to confirm the Conservatives' unchanged position in the electorate. The same could not be said for any of the opposition parties – all of whom ended the election in a radically different position from when they started it by defeating the government.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberals, long the country's dominant political force, saw their vote decline for the fifth consecutive election. With an historically low vote share of under 20 per cent, the party found itself, for the first time, pushed into third place in the Commons. Its future as a centrist, brokerage party must now be seriously in doubt. The New Democrats saw their vote increase by 12 percentage points, in considerable part because their share quadrupled in Quebec where the party captured 59 of the province's 75 seats. As it had never previously held more than one seat in the province, this marked a major breakthrough. The party's parliamentary caucus was suddenly transformed, and with a majority of its members now novices from a part of the country traditionally hostile to the party, it must find ways to incorporate Quebec if it hopes to sustain its newfound place in the system. The Bloc Québécois, which had dominated the province's parliamentary delegation since 1993, collapsed and the party lost all but four of its seats. This marked the fourth time in three decades that the province has been swept by a different party. It would appear that Quebec's voters, who constitute a quarter of the electorate, have abandoned any permanent connection to the party system that organises national electoral competition and choice.</p>
         
         <p>Not only did the Conservatives face a radically realigned and divided opposition, but in the aftermath of the election each of their opponents suffered a leadership crisis. Both the Liberal and Bloc leaders lost their seats, leaving those parties headless. Then the New Democrat leader, who had been such an important part of the party's electoral appeal in Quebec, died suddenly, leaving the official Opposition in the hands of an inexperienced new MP. With all three of the opposition parties without an established leader when the new Parliament convened, the new government had an easy beginning. During the autumn it began to signal that it intended to fulfill some of its longstanding goals. It announced the end of the long‐gun registry hated by its rural constituents and that Canada was formally withdrawing from the Kyoto (climate) Accord. It also began to phase in the end of public subsidies to political parties, which will have far‐reaching, and sharply differential, effects on the financial health of the parties and their capacity to fight future elections.</p>
         
         <p>It was a very active year on the provincial electoral front. Five provinces and two territories went to the polls, and all of the sitting governments (of various political persuasions) were re‐elected. In three provinces and one territory, new premiers came to office by way of party leadership changes; two of them won subsequent general elections, the other two will have some time before they have to face their voters.</p>
         
         <p>In 2010 the voters of British Columbia, unhappy over their provincial government's merging of their Provincial Sales Tax with the federal Goods and Services Tax (into a Harmonized Sales Tax, HST), had begun a tax rebellion using an initiative process to seek a public vote on the issue. The sitting premier had been forced out of office and his successor agreed to hold a referendum (Carty <span><a href="#epdy5-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy5-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 932). The poll was held, by means of a somewhat extended and cumbersome postal vote, over the summer months and the HST was rejected despite the policy advice of almost every economist and business group in the province. The government has now begun the arduous process of disentangling the provincial and federal sales taxes. It appears that it will take a year or two and require the province to reconstruct its sales tax collecting system. Perhaps more threatening for the political class is the notion that referenda may now have been established as a legitimate tool for setting tax policy.
