         <p>The Senate, Canada's unelected upper house, dominated political discussions and generated difficulties for the governing Conservatives. Three of the Senators appointed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper found themselves embroiled in issues involving questionable expense claims and were eventually suspended from the institution. Other institutional questions dogged the majority government, with an MP leaving the party claiming that the Prime Minister's Office was too powerful and another MP introducing a private members' bill that would give the elected members of the caucus the power to remove party leaders. Adding to Conservative woes was the election of a new Liberal leader who vaulted his party into the lead in public opinion polls. These events overshadowed a major cabinet shuffle in the summer and the negotiation of a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>

         <p>There were no national level elections held in Canada in 2013.</p>
         
         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="epdy12041-sec-0003"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="epdy12041-sec-0003-title"> Sub‐national elections</h3>
            
            <p>There are ten provinces and three territories in Canada. Elections were held in the provinces of Nova Scotia, British Columbia and the northern territory of Nunavut. Liberal parties won both provincial elections held in 2013 with the BC Liberals holding on to power and the Nova Scotia Liberals sweeping the New Democratic party from power after only one term. The BC results came as a surprise as the Liberal party under new leader, Christy Clark, was widely expected to lose power to the NDP. Confounding the polls, the Liberals won a comfortable majority – their fourth in a row. Also noteworthy was the success of the Green Party in winning its first provincial seat and garnering over 8 per cent of the vote. Premier Clark lost in her own riding, but was subsequently elected to the legislature in a Liberal party stronghold. At one point, Liberals feared the loss of support to a resurgent provincial Conservative Party but the latter ended up winning less than 5 per cent of the vote. The disastrous NDP result was blamed on the party's leader and the campaign, which eschewed negative advertising and included a change of position on a pipeline extension.</p>
            
            <p>In Nova Scotia the only NDP government ever elected in any of the four Atlantic provinces failed to win re‐election and was reduced to third‐party status in the legislature, holding on to only seven of the 51 seats. With the New Democrats winning in 2009 and the Progressive Conservatives in 2006, this marked the third successive election won by a different party as the Liberals returned to power for the first time in 14 years. The New Democrats suffered from an inability to fulfill their previous campaign promise on the timing of balanced budgets and also had to deal with fallout from an unpopular decision to raise the sales tax.</p>
            
            <p>In both provinces the results were setbacks for the NDP, the federal official opposition party, but the connections between federal and provincial politics are weak in Canada and the impact on the federal party's fortunes are likely minimal. However, new federal Liberal leader Justin Trudeau campaigned in Nova Scotia and was seen as an asset for the provincial party. In BC, the Liberal party combines support from both Liberal and Conservative federal supporters and has no direct ties with the federal Liberal Party.</p>
            
            <p>The territorial election in Nunavut does not involve parties, and all members are elected as individuals. The election was not good for incumbents, with the Premier defeated in her own riding and only six of the 22 seats won by incumbents. In Nunavut, the Premier is decided by a vote of all members of the legislature.</p>

         <p>Minor cabinet changes occurred relatively early in 2013 when Aboriginal Affairs minister John Duncan resigned over a letter he had written to Tax Court on behalf of a constituent, and Intergovernmental Affairs minister Peter Penashue resigned after an Elections Canada investigation found ineligible donations were accepted during his 2011 election campaign. Penashue also resigned from parliament and unsuccessfully contested a by‐election that could have returned him to Ottawa.</p>
         
         <p>Major changes to cabinet took place in the summer of 2013 with the Prime Minister using the midway point in his term to put in place a new cabinet that would lead the party into the next election. Five ministers indicated that they would not seek re‐election and were removed from cabinet while two others also lost their positions. The hope of the Conservatives was that the shuffle would present a new fresh face for the government. A number of senior cabinet ministers changed portfolios, but the Prime Minister left his economic team largely intact. Prominent changes included a swapping of portfolios by Peter McKay and Rob Nicholson, with McKay becoming Justice Minister and Nicholson replacing him at National Defence. Other prominent changes included Jason Kenney moving from Citizenship and Immigration to Employment and Social Development, Rona Ambrose becoming Minister of Health and Leona Aglukkaq taking over the Environment portfolio. A total of eight people became ministers for the first time as the shuffle raised the number of women in cabinet while also lowering the average age. Prior to the July reshuffle, only three ministers were under the age of 40 and the changes increased that number to six.</p>

         <p>With no general election in 2013, changes to party representation were based on the outcome of by‐elections and decisions of MPs to change their status. An Ontario MP who was elected as a New Democrat in 2011, but who sat as an independent for almost two years, crossed the floor to join the Green Party, doubling its Commons representation while delivering a harsh critique of NDP leader Thomas Mulcair. Issues in Quebec provincial politics affected the <i>Bloc Québécois</i> and the party expelled a member who was opposed to the Quebec Values Charter introduced by the provincial <i>Parti Québécois</i>. The MP was openly critical of the Charter which would prevent public employees from wearing overt religious symbols. While she moved from the <i>Bloc</i> to independent status, another NDP MP from Quebec, who indicated that he voted for sovereignty in provincial referenda in 1980 and 1995, shifted to the <i>Bloc</i> and their representation for the year ended where it began.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives suffered a defection in June when an Alberta MP demonstrated some backbench discontent with the Harper government and decided to sit as an independent. The MP was critical of the role played by the Prime Minister's Office in setting the party's agenda and suggested that the party had lost its way. The party also lost a seat in a by‐election after cabinet minister Peter Penashue resigned following an Elections Canada investigation of his 2011 campaign. Penashue contested the by‐election, but lost to the Liberal candidate in a traditional Liberal riding. The other change for the Conservatives also involved an Elections Canada investigation into Conservative spending in 2011 and resulted in an Ontario MP resigning from the Conservative caucus to sit as an independent Conservative. This was offset by the return to the Conservative caucus of a member who had left previously after charges involving tests for impaired driving. A not guilty finding paved the way for his return.</p>
         
         <p>Aside from the defeat of a cabinet minister, the other four by‐elections resulted in no party changes. The results were, however, marked by significant gains in the popular vote by the Liberal Party, which had not fared well in by‐elections the previous year.</p>
         
         <p>The unelected Senate received substantial political attention but the major changes in representation involved the non‐replacement of retiring Senators and the movement of individuals involved in expense claim difficulties to independent status. Full votes of the Senate resulted in the suspension of three Senators who had been appointed by Prime Minister Harper. These Senators had switched affiliation to independent, but as of November were suspended without pay for the duration of the parliamentary session.</p>

         <p>The dominance of the Senate spending scandal placed the Conservatives on the defensive for much of the year and included controversial votes to suspend a number of Senators. The controversy contributed to a growing demand for abolition of the un‐elected upper chamber. The longstanding position of the NDP is to abolish the chamber, and this position received support from the Premier of the western province of Saskatchewan. With growing public dissatisfaction, the government asked the Supreme Court to identify the nature of provincial agreement needed for changes to occur. No decision had been reached by the end of the year.</p>
         
         <p>It was not simply Senators that caused difficulties for the government and kept the issue alive. Prime Minister Harper's Chief of Staff, Nigel Wright, contributed to the controversy by providing one of the Conservative Senators with a cheque for over CAN$90,000 on the condition that the money be used to pay back questionable expense reimbursements. While the Prime Minister initially defended his Chief of Staff, his resignation ensued and questions abounded regarding the degree to which the Prime Minister and his party were aware of the secret payment before it was made. The Prime Minister indicated that he had no prior knowledge of the payment and that he had expected the Senator to ‘pay his own expenses’. Outside audits and Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigations into this and related issues were launched and at the end of the year it was unclear whether charges would be laid.</p>

         <p>Conservative parliamentary troubles spilled into the House of Commons, with an MP leaving the party alleging that the party had lost its way on transparency issues and that the Prime Minister's Office treated the caucus with disdain. Near the end of the year another Conservative MP, and former cabinet minister, introduced a bill into parliament that would allow the elected MPs of a party to depose their leader and amend the Elections Act by removing a provision requiring party leaders to sign off on the nominations of all party candidates. A number of Conservative MPs spoke in favour of the bill and the NDP indicated that they would allow a free vote of their members.</p>
         
         <p>A major Conservative cabinet shuffle in the summer did not refocus the political agenda. The economic team remained relatively stable and the Conservatives focused on Canada's economic strength as a critical indicator of their success in government. Their budget stressed that the economy was the priority and increased spending by almost a billion dollars, held the line on taxes and projected a return to surplus by 2015–2016.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservatives' economic priority was demonstrated by the successful negotiation of a trade deal with the European Union. In October, the Prime Minister and the European Commission President signed a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The Canadian government was very proud of this achievement, which it anticipated would increase Canada's exports to the EU by about 20 per cent. The agreement requires the approval of both the Canadian and European parliaments and took almost four years to negotiate.</p>
         
         <p>The government continued to focus efforts on energy issues and pipeline construction. Pipelines moving oil from Alberta to the Pacific coast were discussed in the BC provincial election campaign and a federal review panel approved the controversial Northern Gateway project, albeit with over 200 conditions. The decision now rests with the federal government but opposition from aboriginal groups and environmentalists has not dissipated. The Conservative government pressed the Obama administration for a decision on the Keystone pipeline which would move Canadian oil through the United States. Although the Prime Minister indicated that Canada would ‘not take no for an answer’, by year end the American administration had not made a decision on the project.</p>
         
         <p>Partially as a result of ‘Idle No More’ protests and a six‐week hunger strike undertaken by aboriginal leader Theresa Spence, aboriginal issues attracted widespread public attention. Meetings involving the Prime Minister, Governor General and aboriginal leaders included a commitment to a high‐level dialogue on treaties and land claims as well as an expressed desire to improve the health and prosperity of First Nation communities. In its budget, the government included a five year promise of CAN$241 million for First Nations skills training. The opposition NDP and Liberal parties signed formal commitments to move forward on a host of contentious issues.</p>
         
         <p>Federal political attention was drawn to the Charter of Quebec Values introduced by the separatist <i>Parti Québécois</i> government in Quebec. The Charter would prohibit public employees from wearing overt religious symbols while they were working and was intended to demonstrate the religious neutrality of the Quebec state. The Charter would also prohibit citizens from having their faces covered when receiving state services. The federal Conservative government indicated that it would refer the controversial legislation to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality while the Liberal and New Democratic parties also condemned the legislation. Public and political discussion of the issue was marked by concerns as to whether reaction to the legislation outside of the province could contribute to a Quebec versus the rest of the country situation which might prove beneficial to the separatist provincial government. The PQ government believed the legislation would be highly popular in the province and were working to ensure its passage through a legislature in which they held only a minority of the seats.
         </p>
         
         <p>Political change reinvigorated the once dominant federal Liberal Party. A leadership election attracted more voters than any previous federal leadership election. Justin Trudeau won an easy first ballot victory, attracting almost 80 per cent of the 104,552 votes cast. His selection contributed to an increase in party popularity with a number of polls ranking the party first. Trudeau is the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who served in that capacity for more than 15 years. Conservative advertisements aimed at undercutting Trudeau's popularity had little traction, and the party vastly increased its support in federal by‐elections, staking out a serious claim as a contender for power in the 2015 federal election.</p>
         
         <p>In January, the Liberal Party of Ontario chose Kathleen Wynne as their leader and she became the first female Premier of the province. With her ascension to the Premier's office, five Canadian provinces, including the four largest, had women serving as leader.</p>
         
         <p>Municipal politics continued to attract massive public attention. The easy re‐election of Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi, whose leadership during a flood crisis was widely praised, generated much positive coverage. Less positive were ongoing hearings on political corruption in Quebec, but unquestionably the major story was Toronto mayor Rob Ford. Following a number of stories relating to alcohol and drug abuse, Ford eventually admitted to smoking crack cocaine, but claimed that he was not an addict and would continue to serve as mayor. Although Toronto's City Council approved a number of measures that severely restricted his powers, Ford remained in office and indicated that he would run for re‐election in 2014.</p>
