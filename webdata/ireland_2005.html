         <p>The year 2006 saw the continuation of the phoney war leading to the election expected to be held in early summer 2007. The year was essentially an extended electoral campaign. Parties made gestures to each other regarding possible coalition partnerships (many of which were to be rendered impossible by simple arithmetic). Fine Gael and Labour further cemented their intentions to form a government together by releasing a series of joint‐policy papers. The two parties agreed five points of principle on which to fight the election. The Green Party leader supposedly ruled out bringing his party into government with Fianna Fáil; Sinn Féin argued that policy, not office, would determine whether it would coalesce with anyone, while Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern ruled out taking his Fianna Fáil party into government with Sinn Féin on the grounds that its policies on the European Union (EU), tax and the economy were incompatible with Fianna Fáil's. Ahern continued to spend time reciting the litany of what he saw as the Government's achievements. Meanwhile the Progressive Democrats party (PD) warned that only it could prevent Sinn Féin from getting into government and the PD Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, angered many in Fianna Fáil, his coalition partner, by claiming that Fianna Fáil ‘may lead’, but that ‘the junior partner defines the direction’. The PD's dismal poll ratings caused it to attempt to frame the election as a choice of coalition partner with Fianna Fáil, hoping to lure middle‐class Fine Gael supporters to vote for it rather than ‘waste’ its vote on Fine Gael.</p>
         
         <p>McDowell's tendency to irritate members of Fianna Fáil was usually relieved by his party leader, Mary Harney, who had a good relationship with Bertie Ahern. However, Harney, following rumours earlier in the summer that McDowell was dissatisfied with her leadership of the small free‐market party, resigned as party leader in order to concentrate on the health portfolio. Initially three of the party's eight TDs (MPs) indicated that they would contest the leadership, but following negotiations among the three, all but Michael McDowell withdrew, making him the leader without a contest on 11 September. This could have caused concern in Fianna Fáil as McDowell is somewhat unpredictable and unconciliatory. However, neither Ahern nor McDowell would have wanted to bring down the Government at that stage.</p>
         
         <p>Soon afterward, McDowell was given an opportunity to strengthen his relationship with Fianna Fáil. An ongoing Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments was found to be investigating payments of €50,000 to Bertie Ahern in 1993 and 1994, when he was Minister for Finance. Mr Ahern, after a good deal of silence, was interviewed on the country's main news programme where he claimed that he had needed the money, which he said was a loan from friends, to help him through financial difficulties arising from the break‐up of his marriage. Though this was obviously in contravention of the ministerial code, the new Tánaiste and PD leader defended the Taoiseach saying it was ‘an honest error of judgement’. Neither McDowell nor Ahern dealt with the issue convincingly, but this did not seem to matter. Opinion polls directly after the crisis showed that, although two out of three people thought the Taoiseach was wrong to accept these payments, support for Fianna Fáil actually increased, while Ahern, who has earned the epithet ‘The Teflon Taoiseach’, maintained his approval ratings.</p>
         
         <p>Mr Ahern was also put under pressure at the end of the year when the Moriarty Tribunal criticised his past practice of signing large numbers of blank cheques for the party leader's account of which he was joint‐signatory for ‘administrative convenience’ as ‘inappropriate and imprudent’ and ‘undoubtedly facilitated the misuse of the account by [former Taoiseach, Charles] Haughey’. This Tribunal found that Mr Haughey, who died during the year, had taken illegal payments and acted in a corrupt manner. This caused further embarrassment for Ahern, who had eulogised Haughey at his graveside oration.</p>
         
         <p>Another symptom of the extended election campaign was the attempt by all parties to emphasise their nationalist credentials. The 90th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising (an unsuccessful military revolt, which, owing to British overreaction, became a crucial moment in Irish history and led to Irish independence) took place; all parties wished to associate themselves with this event and make what they hoped to be speeches setting out their idea of a republic and preventing Sinn Féin monopolising the description ‘Republican’. Opinion polls indicated that Sinn Féin's electoral growth had stopped, but the party's move on accepting policing in Northern Ireland and the probability that a devolved Northern Ireland government would be set up in 2007 looked as if it might boost its electoral fortunes.</p>
         
         <p>A number of other issues dominated Irish politics in the year. Perhaps happily for Fianna Fáil, these tended to centre on portfolios held by its junior coalition partner. Health was a major issue with almost daily media reports of the numbers of patients forced to wait on trolleys. The deaths in unfortunate circumstances of a number of patients put further pressure on the Minister for Health who was attempting an overhaul of the health care system. These reforms were often described as facilitating a ‘two‐tier health system’. Other changes in health care included an attempt to regulate the health insurance market. This involved insurers making payments to other insurers with higher risk clients. It seemed to fail late in the year when the second largest company, BUPA (Ireland), announced it was to close its operations. Health, which is now managed by an agency, the Health Service Executive, provided more bad publicity for the Government in the form of revelations about the quality and monitoring of nursing homes.</p>
         
         <p>In the other portfolio not held by Fianna Fáil – Justice – a number of issues arose that caused problems. There was a spate of shootings throughout the year leading to perceptions that ‘gangland’ crime had increased dramatically. Opposition parties made drastic statements indicating that Irish streets were no longer safe for ordinary citizens – although the hyperbole failed to strike a chord. An appeal by a man convicted of raping a 14 year‐old girl when he was 18 was successful and led a High Court judge to enable the release of all those convicted using the 1935 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act on statutory rape. The Act (unconstitutionally) prevented the man from offering a defence of being unaware of the victim's age (in this case, the victim who had consensual sex with the convicted man had told him she was 16). The Supreme Court struck down the Act, but prevented the immediate release of convicted rapists. Howls of outrage came from the opposition calling for the Government to resign. Indeed, there were rumours around the Dáil (lower house) that the Government would fall. This, of course, was never going to happen as the Government had a secure majority. However, it did not prevent it from overreacting by rushing, as it turned out, unnecessary and flawed legislation through the <i>Oireachtas</i> (parliament) and promising a referendum on a constitutional amendment to protect children's rights.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another perceived crisis resulted from the part‐privatisation of Aer Lingus, the state‐owned air carrier. Soon after this took place, the Irish‐owned discount airline Ryanair announced a takeover plan for Aer Lingus. Though it was in probable contravention of EU and domestic competition laws, the takeover attempt embarrassed the Government, which was accused of botching the privatisation by underselling the company.</p>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, the Budget gave the Government an opportunity to set the agenda for the election campaign. The Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen, reduced the higher rate of tax by one percentage point and promised another point drop if the Government was re‐elected. Despite an increase in government spending by 12 per cent (facilitated by better than expected tax receipts), he managed not to convey the impression of a giveaway budget. The Government looked set to use this as a sign of its fiscal responsibility while accusing opposition parties of being untrustworthy with the economy in the ongoing election campaign. This was especially pertinent given signs of a slowdown in Ireland's continued remarkable economic growth.</p>
