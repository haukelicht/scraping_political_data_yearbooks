         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12009-sec-0002-title"> The presidential election</h2>
         
         <p>Incumbent President Tarja Halonen's second term was over and according to the law she had to resign. In total, eight candidates were nominated: two female and six male. Every party in parliament nominated a candidate of its own, since visibility in politics has high priority, but some were more serious competitors than others. Sauli Niinistö, who took a huge lead in the polls, was nominated by the National Coalition Party. His major challengers were Pekka Haavisto from the Greens and Paavo Väyrynen from the Centre Party. Väyrynen, with a long career in politics, had been sidelined from the party leadership due to his critical statements about the party, its policy and its leader. As no one else in the party was willing to run, he was nominated in a primary by his eurosceptic supporters. The other challengers included former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen from the Social Democrats, who, unlike Väyrynen, was strongly supported by his party; Timo Soini, party leader of the True Finns, who had achieved the largest candidate vote at the 2011 parliamentary elections (his intention was not to challenge Niinistö, but rather just to get an arena to spread his right‐wing populist views); the party leader and Minister of Culture and Sport Paavo Arhinmäki was nominated by his Left‐Wing Alliance; the Swedish People's Party nominated Eva Biaudet; and the Christian Democrats nominated Sari Essayah.</p>
         
         <p>Compared to the previous three presidential elections, issues related to gender totally vanished. In 1994 Elisabeth Rehn from the Swedish People's Party failed to win, but managed to mobilise strong female support. In the ensuing two elections, Tarja Halonen from SDP won and was the first female Finnish President. By contrast, in 2012, the two female candidates Eva Biaudet and Sari Essayah combined won barely more than 5 per cent of the total vote, even though the female turnout was 4.3 per cent higher than the male one. In addition, 175,870 more women than men were eligible to vote, which exceeds the combined total votes cast for Biaudet and Essayah. Instead, a new issue dimension occurred as the Green candidate Pekka Haavisto openly declared his homosexuality. Polls showed that although Niinstö's support was shrinking somewhat, he was not seriously threatened by Haavisto and Väyrynen, who were neck‐and‐neck for much of the contest. All others lagged far behind. Lipponen was sure of last‐minute support from his own party voters, but the SDP voters followed more the polls than the party, and he was deeply disappointed with the result, as was Väyrynen who failed to qualify for the second round by a small margin. It might well be the case that Väyrynen faced the Borda paradox, which states that if the third candidate is allowed to go to the second round he might win. In this case he would surely not have won, but it is speculated that he might have achieved a better result than Haavisto.</p>
         
         <p>Sauli Niinistö, who was barely beaten by Tarja Halonen in the second round six years ago, had a huge lead over Pekka Haavisto this time. Polls showed support exceeding 60 per cent for Niinistö. The election seemed to lack a competitive flavour. Haavisto got much publicity when he introduced his significant other, Antonio Flores, originally from Latin America. Speculation whether the president of Finland could represent the country at home and internationally with a male spouse roused emotions. Haavisto's international experience and reputation from crisis management and human aid in the southern part of the globe was, on the other hand, well documented. Niinstö's profile was much different. A former Minister of Finance, vice‐chair of the European Investment Bank and chair of the Finnish parliament, he was known to be a tough guardian of state finances when Finland suffered from economic recession in the 1990s. In addition, he strongly defended the European Union and Finland's commitments within it. Niinistö's private life also played a role in the campaign, since he had recently married to a considerably younger woman who had worked for the National Coalition Party.</p>
         
         <p>Since no candidate won a majority in the first round of voting, a second round was required, with all bar the top two candidates eliminated. Voter turnout sank in the second round to 66 per cent, probably due to the polls, which gave Niinistö a huge lead. However, it is interesting to note that the gap between female and male turnout grew considerably. Only 62.8 per cent of men voted, compared to 69 per cent of women. Thus, the gender gap grew from 4.3 per cent in the first round to 6.2 per cent. Haavisto's humanity appealed to many females, whereas others were strongly against him. Most of Paavo Väyrynen's and Timo Soini's voters from the first round supported Niinistö in the second round, whereas Paavo Lipponen's voters were equally divided between the two candidates. Practically all of Sari Essayah's voters supported Ninistö in the second round, and similarly almost all of Paavo Arhinmäki's voters chose to vote for Haavisto. Party loyalty is weak in presidential elections, which disappointed some of the candidates, but others like Niinistö and Haavisto took advantage of this fact. Haavisto's sexual preference revealed a division between voters along liberal and conservative values resulting in a traditional division between left and right, which from the outset lacked any signs of drama as the outcome of the election was more or less given. Ultimately the polls proved correct, as Niinistö won the election with an almost 2 to 1 majority.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12009-sec-0003-title"> Issues in politics</h2>
         
         <p>The Minister of Defence and the leader of the Swedish People's Party, Stefan Wallin, resigned from both posts in June. Carl Haglund from the ALDE party in the European Parliament was nominated and won the leadership battle against the Minister of Justice Anna‐Maja Henriksson. As a part of the deal, the new party leader also took over Wallin's ministerial portfolio. Before Wallin's resignation, he was attacked by the True Finns and others committed to Finnish nationalism. The organisation of Finland's defence was subject to change due to lack of money, expensive investments and a shrinking youth. Together with the military command, Wallin had to implement the decisions made by the parliament, which involved the closure of several military garrisons, with severe implications for the local communities affected. However, the sole Swedish brigade was under attack as the True Finns and others like‐minded proposed to shut down this garrison and let it merge with a Finnish‐speaking unit close to Helsinki. The costs of such an operation were not the key issue. Of greater importance was the effort to ensure that ethnic Swedes did not suffer less than Finns. Wallin managed to save the Swedish marine garrison (Nylands Brigad) but was heavily attacked in the media, and in parliament. Although Wallin denied that his reassignment had anything to do with this reorganisation affair, its timing suggests otherwise.</p>
         
         <p>Wallin's retreat to the backbenches stood in stark contrast to the fate of the other ministerial resignation: Minister of Economic Affairs Jyri Häkämies, who left his post to become Director General to the Confederation of Finnish Industries – the highest ranked position in Finnish industry.</p>
         
         <p>In the autumn the prime ministers of Finland and Sweden agreed to cooperate in guarding Icelandic air space with unarmed military planes. Iceland has no defence forces, but is a member of NATO. This agreement resulted in protests from the opposition and from the public. When the Russian general and Deputy Minister of Defence Nikolaj Makarov visited President Niinistö in June he warned Finland about cooperating with NATO, which he saw as proof of a coming full membership. Makarov considered that such a move would pose a military threat to Russia. He also accused Finland of supporting those in Georgia seeking revenge to win back South Ossetia and Abkhazia. These statements further increased the unpopularity of the proposed Icelandic air policing, as many feared the impact it might have on relations with Russia, and thereby on Finnish neutrality</p>
         
         <p>In the Centre Party, problems continued to escalate after the party's poor showing in the 2011 parliamentary elections. Party leader and former Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi was under pressure as party veteran Paavo Väyrynen put personal responsibility on her for the bad electoral result. In addition, the challenge from the True Finns put pressure on the party to go back to its roots and defend peripheral Finland. During its last government period, the party had ambitions to become more urbanised, which resulted in a backlash. In the summer party congress Kiviniemi was replaced with Juha Sipilä. His main task was to give the Centre Party new fuel for the municipal elections in October.</p>
         
         <p>The government was faced with many problems, many of them self‐generated Six parties, ranging from the ex‐communist Left‐Wing Alliance to the conservative National Coalition, have given the government the character of a mini‐parliament. The two parties in opposition – the True Finns and the Centre Party – have had an excellent opportunity to attack the government. Two issues above all have been on the agenda: the municipality reform and the financial crisis in the EU. Finland is a unitary state and municipalities do not have much to say when the government plans to amalgamate them to big units in the name of efficiency. This reform is made more complicated as the municipalities must be big enough to take responsibility for health and social care, and because the government has no intention of creating regional authorities with direct elections to take charge of health care. However, the government has not come to terms with how to implement the reform, particularly the number of municipalities to amalgamate and whether it should be voluntary or coercive. One plan after another has been heavily attacked by the two opposition parties on the grounds that amalgamations are expensive and that local democracy will be violated. As no one knows what is to come, this proposal is still open and has led to uncertainty and confusion in the municipalities.</p>
         
         <p>The EU financial crisis in southern Europe has fueled much controversy within and outside government. In fact the demand for solidarity with states in financial crisis in the EU seems to have transformed the issue into a new divide in Finnish politics. Before the crisis, Finns regarded other EU Member States as sovereign with no call for interference from the Finnish government, parties or opinion. In 2012 the situation changed radically. The financial crisis in southern Europe has moved into the Finnish bedrooms. The True Finns have successfully appealed to this divide during the election campaign, but the mistrust against financial aid was distributed widely throughout the electorate, including government parties. In government, the cleavage is visible between Prime Minister Katainen and the SDP Minister of Finance Urpilainen, who has demanded security for all loans given to Greece. Unemployment is increasing in Finland (8 per cent in December 2012) and the budget is in deficit, which means that the government faces pressure to stimulate the economy but has few economic resources with which to do so. Katainen has proposed a reform to increase the pension age but has met resistance from Finance Minister Urpilainen, supported by her party and the trade union. However, this issue is not forgotten and the Prime Minister is wrestling with his stimulus plans to get people to work longer. In fact, the union for highly skilled professionals (AKAVA) has already signaled its readiness to discuss an increase in the pension age and to enhance the efficiency of time spent at universities.</p>
