         <p>Three issues dominated the political agenda in France in 2015: terrorism, a depressed economic context and the consolidation of the extreme right as a third political force. Against a background of international crises (within the European Union and with the influx of refugees fleeing the Middle East), the government's agenda also included the adoption of three long‐planned major reforms on the economy, on health and on territorial organisation, as well as emergency initiatives in relation to terrorism. Two series of coordinated terrorist attacks in January and November produced an initial rallying around the flag, but the rise in the popularity of the President and his government did not last or translate into electoral gains. On the contrary, the National Front emerged as the largest party in opposition at two subnational elections held in March and December.</p>

         <p>Subnational ballots are often used by voters to punish the government in power (Gougou &amp; Labouret <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). While this traditionally benefits the main party in opposition, it was the National Front (FN) under the leadership of Marine LePen that benefitted in 2015. Both elections confirmed the tri‐partition of France's political space observed since the 1980s (Grunberg &amp; Schweisguth <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2003</a></span>), though partially obscured by the proximity of the electorates of FN and Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in the 2012 presidential elections (Gougou &amp; Labouret <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Departmental elections, March 2015</h3>
            
            <p>The departmental elections took place under an entirely new voting system. Changes included a redistricting reform, a synchronisation of the electoral calendar and the introduction of a binominal voting system favouring gender balance. French voters elected 4,108 departmental councillors in a two‐ballot system (22 and 29 March) with raised levels of turnout that approached 50 per cent. In a so‐called ‘third round’, each departmental council then designated a president, entrusted with local executive powers. The election result can be interpreted as a sanction against governmental policies, since the left received only 25.5 per cent of the vote and lost the majority in 28 departments. The right (composed of UMP and the Union of Democrats and Independents [UDI]) was the uncontested winner – its 38 per cent of the votes gave it the majority of seats in 67 of the 101 departments – but the FN established itself firmly as France's third political force with 22.2 per cent of the votes, even though it failed to win the presidency of any department. One can note a significant change in the gender composition of departmental councils thanks to the new rules: 50 per cent of the councillors elected in 2015 were women, compared to 14 per cent in 2011.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Regional elections, December 2015</h3>
            
            <p>Regional elections were held for the first time after the territorial reform (see below) in December 2015. Following mergers, the number of regions was reduced from 22 to 13 and entailed redistricting. Electoral polls predicted the victory of the FN in several regions and debates thus largely focused on the attitude that mainstream parties (the Republicans and the Socialist Party, respectively LR and PS) should adopt in case of a triangular competition in the second ballot. The mixed electoral two‐round system was designed to limit the influence of non‐mainstream parties (Drake <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 976) and facilitate electoral alliances. However, it did not prevent the FN from attracting 27.7 per cent of the votes cast in the first round, thereby establishing itself as the strongest party in six of the 13 regions. The attitudes of the PS and LR were contrasted. Between the two rounds, PS leader Jean‐Christophe Cambadélis announced the withdrawal of Socialist lists in three regions where the FN stood a chance to win the second round in the name of a ‘republican front’ that would prevent the FN from gaining the leadership of those regional councils. However, this position was not reciprocated by Sarkozy, president of LR. In the second round, turnout increased by 10 points to 59 per cent and FN maintained its share of the national vote (dropping only slightly to 27.1 per cent), but the party failed to gain a majority of seats or the executive in any of the 13 regions. After a disappointing result in the first round, the right gained 40.2 per cent of the votes and took control of seven regions. The defeat of the left was less significant than predicted, with the PS collecting 32.1 per cent of the votes and gaining the majority in five regions.

         <p>The second government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls was announced on 25 August 2014 and in 2015 composition did not change markedly from its initial composition of 17 ministers (nine men and eight women), including 15 PS members and two members of the Radical Left Party (PRG).</p>

         <p>A number of major reforms promoted by the government were adopted in 2015. They triggered heated debates in parliament, divided the governmental coalition and sparked social protests and mobilisation.</p>
         
         <p>A law on decentralisation and territorial organisation of powers (called ‘NOTRe’) was adopted in the summer (Legifrance <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015a</a></span>). It transfers powers from the departmental to the regional level, and clarifies the remits of both levels of territorial government. It includes boundary changes (cf. <b>Election report</b> above).
         </p>
         
         <p>The government forced through the adoption of Finance Minister Emmanuel Macron's bill on competitiveness, resorting on three occasions to its strongest legislative weapon: Article 49.3 of the Constitution, which makes a vote into a question of confidence (Legifrance <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015b</a></span>). The legislation was presented as a means to boost France's stagnant growth and combat unemployment through a modernisation of the labour legislation. The reform changes rules on working hours, on regulated professions (including legal professionals, taxis) and on the introduction of competition in intercity public transport, as well as on the sale of public assets. The package spurred discontent but was eventually passed in July.
         </p>
         
         <p>A similarly divisive bill, involving comprehensive modernisation of the funding and access to the French health care system, was adopted in December (Legifrance <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015c</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In preparation for the United Nations summit on climate change (COP21) held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December, the government passed a bill on green growth and energy that combines rules on fuel efficiency, and increases the share of renewable sources of energy and investment in green technologies (Legifrance <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0012" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0012R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015d</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The government also found parliamentary support for measures involving increased investments in the military and the police. Such consensus on national security was a response to perceived terrorist threats. A bill on intelligence (Legifrance <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015e</a></span>) was adopted on 24 July 2015. The text widens the interception of communications of persons suspected of illegal activities through the use of automated search software. The new ability of the government to use search powers outside of judicial controls in case of emergency was criticised both by the Union of Magistrates and by independent authorities on civil liberties and digital information as an erosion of civil liberties. After changing a few nuances, the government has also found support on its diplomatic and military responses, in particular in relation to military bombings in Syria.

         <p>Parties faced a difficult year and all experienced internal divisions. The PS government was confronted with MPs’ unrest in relation to the perceived neoliberal‐inspired economic bill promoted by Finance Minister Emmanuel Macron. The rebellion quietened after the party congress in June, where factions found a compromise and Cambadélis was confirmed as First National Secretary through a ballot of the membership. Cambadélis sought to confirm this electoral legitimacy with the organisation of an internal referendum on his electoral strategy for the regional election in October (PS <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). However, divisions resurfaced at the end of the year with the government's application of the ‘<i>état d'urgence</i>’. They increased further with the debate on the reform of the constitution announced by President François Hollande to the Congress after the November attacks (see below). The issue of stripping citizens of French nationality proved to be the biggest hurdle.
         </p>
         
         <p>In December 2014, former President Nicolas Sarkozy came back to frontline politics as the newly elected president of the UMP. At the beginning of 2015, he decided to make his mark on his organisation: the party changed its name to ‘Les Républicains’ (LR) and a new party constitution banned factions and instituted primaries for the selection of the presidential candidate. Despite the party's good electoral performance in March, divisions emerged on the question of electoral strategy and ideological positioning. Rivals within the party (particularly Nathalie Kosciusko‐Morizet, Alain Juppé and Francois Fillon, all possible contenders for the presidential primary scheduled in 2016) argued in favour of a ‘republican front’ to prevent the election of FN councillors. On the contrary, Sarkozy chose to oppose equally both the extreme right (FN) and the left (PS and allies). By the end of the year, Sarkozy expelled Kosciusko‐Morizet from the party's executive council, barely a year after he had placed her on his team. On the other hand, Juppé’s popularity appeared to pose a growing threat to Sarkozy's chance of being selected as the right's presidential candidate in 2017.</p>
         
         <p>For FN, 2015 proved to be a year complicated and full of contrasts. Early in the year the party's reputation was tainted by Le Pen family feuds between the father (Jean‐Marie, who founded the party in 1974), the daughter (Marine, president of the party since 2011) and the granddaughter/niece (Marion Maréchal Le Pen, elected the youngest French MP ever in 2012). Opposed to the ‘normalisation’ strategy endorsed by his daughter since 2012, Jean‐Marie Le Pen took increasingly provocative positions. He was eventually excluded from the party and denied a prominent role for the regional elections where he was replaced by his granddaughter. Despite impressive scores at the departmental and regional elections (see above), the FN failed to win either. The ability of the ‘republican front’ to stall its electoral progress demonstrated that the FN remains a ‘toxic’ brand (Crépon et al. <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). The party also faced a succession of indictments for fraud and financial wrongdoings (fake jobs at the European Parliament, presidential campaign 2012, Jean‐Marie Le Pens’ tax evasion).
         </p>
         
         <p>Divisions also featured on the left when the prominent members of the green party EELV opposed the party's strategy of electoral coalition with the Front de Gauche (a coalition of the Communist Party and of the Parti de Gauche led by Mélenchon). Choosing to pursue cooperation with the government, they resigned from the parliamentary group and founded a new party called ‘Ecologistes!’.</p>

         <p>The year 2015 was rich in institutional implications beyond the territorial reform (discussed above). Having proclaimed an emergency situation on the early hours of 14 November, Hollande announced to both houses, gathered in Congress in Versailles on 16 November, his intention to request an extension of the executive's special powers and a reform of the Constitution. The government bill extending the state of emergency to three months was overwhelmingly adopted by both houses (19 and 20 November) (Sénat <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0016" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0016R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). It granted the government exceptional police powers outside of the control of the judiciary and included restrictions on individual civil liberties (house arrest and searches of private residences).
         </p>
         
         <p>President Hollande's announced constitutional reform includes two measures. The first of these – giving constitutional status to the 1955 legislation on the state of emergency – gained a political consensus. The second – an amendment that would allow stripping convicted terrorists of their French nationality – was more controversial. The debate picked up in December and opened a deep rift within the left and within the government itself. The amendment's opponents denounced it as the adoption of a suggestion made by the FN that had previously been rejected by the party and warned that it could create stateless persons if applied to all French citizens or would introduce inequalities between French nationals and ‘hyphenated’ French nationals holding another passport.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12122-sec-0090-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Terrorism dominated 2015 in France. The first series of attacks, resulting in 17 deaths, targeted the headquarters of the satirical newspaper <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> in Paris, the murder of a policewoman and a hostage situation in a Jewish supermarket (7–9 January). The violence of the images, the symbolic dimensions of the attack (on the values of the Republic, the State and the Nation) and the unprecedented live coverage of the events triggered a strong emotional reaction (Boussaguet &amp; Faucher <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>). Calls for national unity and solidarity translated into the co‐organisation by the left and the government of silent marches across the country, culminating with 70 international delegations coming to Paris to show their solidarity on 11 January. The consensus on national unity progressively eroded as media coverage revealed tensions around issues of national security, immigration and ‘Islamophobia’.
         </p>
         
         <p>A second wave of coordinated attacks in Paris in November targeting restaurants, a concert hall and the Stade de France resulted in 129 deaths and 300 wounded, but recent experience of related attacks and the proximity of the regional elections meant that national unity was this time short‐lived and even more quickly intensified debates on the tension between freedom and security. As the majority of the terrorists proved to be French nationals, the events exposed the failures of successive French governments since 2005 in responding to the frustration of marginalised youth and the persistence of a ‘territorial, social and ethnic apartheid’ in France (<i>Le Monde</i> <span><a href="#epdy12122-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12122-bib-0014R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The international context also proved particularly difficult as it was exacerbated by the Greek euro crisis, the decision to bomb Syria and the arrival of thousands of refugees at the European borders. Horrific images of fleeing families, drowned children and of the migrant camp in Calais fuelled feelings of insecurity and populist anti‐European, anti‐immigration and anti‐Islam rhetoric. They combined with a sluggish economic growth and persistently high levels of unemployment to draw attention to the inability of the political elites to respond to crises. The media extensively covered several court trials involving the political elites of both right and left (Strauss‐Kahn's sexual misconduct, enquiries about the funding of Sarkozy's presidential campaigns, tax evasion by ministers), furthering resentment at the lack of political and moral leadership of elected representatives.</p>
         
         <p>The terrorist attacks also affected the organisation of the COP21 summit. President Hollande's declaration of a state of emergency on 14 November outlawed all demonstrations, including major environmentalist marches planned to coincide with the summit. The cancellation of scheduled civil society marches and side meetings, as well as the house arrest placed on environmental activists sparked controversies. Eventually, a (non‐binding) international agreement setting new targets, providing the framework for the adoption of reductions in national emissions was signed by 195 countries at COP21. This was hailed as a success by the government.</p>
