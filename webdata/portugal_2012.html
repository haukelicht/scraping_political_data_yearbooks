         <p>Throughout 2012, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho′s conservative coalition government (consisting of the liberal Social Democrats (Partido Social Democrata, PSD) and the conservative Democratic Social Centre/People's Party (Centro Democratico Social‐Partido Popular, CDS‐PP)) continued the austerity policies set out in the memorandum of understanding of 3 May 2011, negotiated and agreed with the troika consisting of representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB). For the strict implementation of a considerable amount of short‐, medium‐ and long‐term measures, the Portuguese government received a bail‐out of €78 billion (Magone <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 263–264). The troika came every three months to evaluate the process of implementation and allow the payment of a further tranche of the agreed bail‐out sum. Until the end of 2011, the Portuguese government fulfilled most of the short‐term measures agreed with the troika. It was also able to end the year with a budget deficit of 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) – well below the target of 5.9 per cent agreed with the troika and down from the original target of 8.5 per cent. However, this was achieved only because the troika allowed a one‐off transfer of the surplus in the pension funds of the public banking sector into the budget (Magone <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 266–267).
         </p>
         
         <p>The continuation of a policy of austerity had a major impact on the weak Portuguese economy. The country's GDP, which had shrunk 1.8 per cent in 2011, contracted a further 3.2 per cent in 2012, according to provisional figures of the National Institute for Statistics. In particular, the last quarter of 2012 experienced a contraction of 3.8 per cent. This had a major impact on the social situation in the country. Unemployment rose from 14 per cent at the beginning of the year to 16.9 per cent at the end. Although these figures were quite low in comparison to the situation in Spain and Greece, this was due partly to emigration to Portuguese‐speaking countries in Africa such as Angola and Mozambique, Brazil or other countries in the European Union such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Basically, Portugal is exporting its unemployment.</p>
         
         <p>The austerity plans of the government were complicated by the fact that the government, but also the IMF, had under‐estimated the impact of the economic policies on the labour market. This was acknowledged by the IMF at the end of the year, which had miscalculated the effects of the austerity policies (<i>Expresso</i>, 9 October 2012; IMF <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 41). One of the major effects of this miscalculation was that the expected tax revenue failed to materialise and a considerable shortfall emerged in the agreed target of the government to keep the budget deficit at 4.5 per cent (<i>O Publico</i>, 22 June 2012). After the summer recess, the troika agreed to increase it to 5 per cent. However, the final figure of the budget deficit for the year 2012 was then actually 6.4 per cent. Public debt increased considerably, coming closer to the debt levels of Italy and Greece. While in 2010 it was still 94.7 per cent, at the end of 2012 it had reached the quite critical figure of 123.7 per cent of GDP (Eurostat, <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>) – well above the 60 per cent threshold of the Maastricht criteria.
         </p>
         
         <p>The austerity plans of the government were complicated by both the internal opposition of the other left‐wing parties in the Portuguese parliament and the volatile global markets, which during the year began to affect the quite difficult situation in Spain and Italy. The banking sector crisis in Spain was a major worry for the Portuguese banks due to the high level of indebtedness to them. It was estimated that Portuguese banks had a debt of over €100 billion to Spanish banks. In the memorandum of understanding, €12 billion was reserved for the recapitalisation of the banks. Spain was able to secure a softer bail‐out of €38 billion to recapitalise and restructure its banking sector on 10 June 2012 (<i>El Pais</i>, 10 June 2012). While the ECB was providing cheap loans to Portuguese banks, this was not passed on to enterprises, leading to an increased number of bankruptcies of businesses throughout the year. In particular, the crucial construction sector was affected by this situation due to the fact that many larger contracts were done through the public institutions and payment was delayed or not forthcoming.
         </p>
         
         <p>Interest rates for Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds remained at unsustainable levels until the autumn of 2012 and this affected those of Greece and Portugal. It meant that it was quite impossible for Portugal to return to the markets, and the target to do this by the autumn of 2013 became less feasible. The difficult economic situation, the missed budget deficit target and the volatility of the markets led to the extension of the fulfilment of the extensive memorandum of understanding by one year to 2014 (<i>O Publico</i>, 11 September 2012).
         </p>
         
         <p>Domestic opposition increased considerably throughout the year. The conservative coalition government had to face considerable opposition from the other political parties in parliament. All three opposition parties were left‐wing, so they were quite critical of the government's austerity packages. While the Socialists (Partido Socialista, PS) under the leadership of António José Seguro were moderate and responsible due to the fact that the previous Socialist minority government had negotiated the memorandum of understanding, support began to wane away throughout the year due to the difficult social and economic situation. Moreover, the Socialists were influenced by the overarching call of the European socialists for a complementary growth and competitiveness package to reduce the effects of the austerity package. Party leader Seguro also had to deal with the growing opposition inside his party to his moderate position, so he voiced more criticisms of government policies throughout the year.</p>
         
         <p>The other two main parties – the Communist Party (Partido Comunista Português, PCP) and the Bloc of the Left (Bloco da Esquerda, BE) were completely opposed to the troika, the memorandum of understanding and the austerity policies of the conservative coalition government. They were uncompromising and regarded the troika as infringing national sovereignty. In 2011, both parties refused to meet with the troika or take part in the negotiation of the memorandum of understanding, so that they were outside the group of parties (PS, PSD and CDS‐PP) that had agreed to the terms of the bail‐out.</p>
         
         <p>In July 2012, the Constitutional Court ruled that the cuts to the Christmas and summer bonuses of civil servants were unconstitutional and should be reinstated in 2013. However, the Court also ruled that due to the dire economic situation the government was allowed to keep these cuts for the ongoing year. This was a major blow for the austerity plans of the government and it had to find new sources of income in order to cover the projected shortfall for the years 2013 and 2014.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the autumn the government tried to persuade the Socialists to support or, at least, to abstain from voting on the 2013 budget. It was certain that the Communist Party and the Bloc of the Left would vote against the budget, but there was hope that the Socialists would be critical, but also moderate in their approach towards the austerity policies of the government. However, in the end the Socialist Party joined the other left‐wing parties in rejecting the budget on 27 November 2012 (<i>O Publico</i>, 30 October 2012). President of the Republic Anibal Cavaco Silva signed the document on 28 December 2012, but then sent it for <i>post facto</i> scrutiny to the Constitutional Court in order to verify its constitutionality in terms of the proper distribution of sacrifice among the population (<i>Ionline</i>, 15 January 2013). The main new measures of the 2013 budget are: an additional rate on the income tax of 3.5 per cent; an increase of the value‐added tax for the gastronomy sector; the tax on tobacco increased to 20 per cent; €1 billion cuts in public‐private partnerships (most of them are considered a failure in Portugal); state employees with fixed‐term contracts (two‐thirds are teachers) will be dismissed and retired civil servants not replaced (in total: 89,987); tax reform to reduce the number of brackets from eight to five; a considerable increase in the housing estate tax worth more than €1 million; more difficult access to unemployment benefit both for young and older people; more difficult access to social aid ; progressive cut from 3.5 to 10 per cent in pensions above €1,500 throughout 2013; increase in the rate of tax on capital gains from 25 to 28 per cent; and, after a major review of publicly funded foundations, expenditure in this sector was halved from €400 to €200 million.
         </p>
         
         <p>The new progressive income tax reduced the original eight brackets to just five brackets. The brackets are: less than €7,000 per year: 14.5 per cent; between €7,000 and 20,000: 28.5 per cent; between €20,000 and 40,000: 37 per cent; between €40,000 and 80,000: 45 per cent; and above €80,000: 48 per cent. As already mentioned, all taxpayers have to pay an additional solidarity surtax of 3.5 per cent due to the crisis, and the last bracket, an additional 2.5 per cent, raising the total tax levy against the highest to 54 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout 2012 the government tried to continue its programme of the privatisation of public enterprises. It particularly focused on two major enterprises: the ailing Portuguese airlines TAP (Transportes Aereos Portugueses) and the enterprise owning and running all airports in Portugal. Although TAP has a very strong portfolio of connections to Latin America, the state of the company is quite poor. The airline still has an excessively large staff and an estimated debt of €500 million. Because the government required any potential buyer to take on TAP's liabilities, it was difficult to find a serious buyer for the airline. At the end of the year, the government decided to reject the only potential buyer – a Colombian billionaire German, Efromovich, due to the lack of sufficiently strong financial guarantees. In contrast, the ANA (Aeroportos de Portugal) was successfully privatised. ANA was a successful enterprise which was able to make annual returns of 40 per cent. It was bought by a French consortium, Vinci, for €3 billion. However, one major criticism seems to be that in the negotiations the government gave an exclusive right to the French consortium to build and manage the new Lisbon airport, which will be paid for by the Portuguese taxpayers at a cost of €3.7 billion. It means that the consortium will make a profit in the medium to long term (<i>Semanario Economico</i>, 22 February 2012).

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12027-sec-0002-title"> Growth and competitiveness pact agreed with social partners</h2>
         
         <p>After difficult negotiations in the last months of 2011 and in January 2012 a social concertation agreement was signed in the tripartite Permanent Committee of Social Concertation (Comissão Permanente da Concertação Social, CPCS), which is presided over by the government and has existed since 1984. The agreement, signed on 18 January <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span> after 17 hours of negotiations, included all social partners except the largest trade union confederation – the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (Confederação Geral dos Trabalhadores Portugueses, CGTP). The so‐called ‘Commitment for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment’ consists of 53 pages, comprising a range of measures to make the Portuguese economy more competitive. It includes reforms in all parts of the economy. One specific area emphasised throughout the document is the need to improve the competitiveness of Portuguese enterprises. The improvement of credit for small and medium‐sized enterprises is one the features of the agreement. However, the laws to increase the flexibility of the labour market are the ones that will have the most direct short‐term impact on the working population. Among these measures are the reduction of the severance pay in case of dismissals, limitations in the autonomy in collective agreements, an overhaul of the unemployment benefit system and an increase in the efficiency of labour activation policies, particularly through a better integration with the needs of enterprises. The unemployment benefit was also reduced (Lima <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Industrial relations remained a major problem throughout the year. The rejection of the agreement by the largest trade union confederation, CGTP, led to several demonstrations and strikes throughout the year. It also led to a division within the trade union movement because the General Union of Workers (União Geral dos Trabalhadores, UGT) signed the agreement. Therefore, many trade union associations within the UGT decided to defect to the CGTP, which had a more combative approach towards the policies of the government.</p>
         
         <p>A considerable deterioration and decline of collective agreements was the consequence of the austerity measures. According to official figures, while there were 170 collective agreements in 2011, this number fell to 85 in 2012. Both figures are quite low compared to 295 in 2008 – the last year before the financial crisis (Lima <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>During the year CGTP organised two general strikes on 22 March and 14 November. In both cases, the other main trade union confederation did not join the protests. The second general strike was done in conjunction with the main trade union confederations, the General Workers’ Union (Union General de Trabajadores, UGT) and the Workers’ Commission (Comisiones Obreras, CCOO). This was the first ever Iberian general strike. The general strike was used by more violent groups to organise clashes in front of the Portuguese parliament. These demonstrations before parliament led mainly to protests against the austerity policies of the government and the new measures envisaged in the budget for 2013.</p>
         
         <p>According to the annual report for internal security, 3,012 demonstrations took place throughout the year, protesting mainly against the measures of the government. This is up from 702 and 679 registered and policed events in 2011 and 2010, respectively (<i>O Publico</i>, 28 March 2012; Sistema de Segurança Interna <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0017" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0017R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 212; <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0016" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0016R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 212; <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 162). These figures show a substantial increase in contestation in Portugal, which is related to the austerity measures of the government.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12027-sec-0003-title"> Restructuring the judiciary and local government</h2>
         
         <p>In the memorandum of understanding there were also other more long‐term reforms planned that were partly implemented throughout 2012. The reform of the judiciary is probably one of the most important ones because Portugal is still characterised by a quite slow and inefficient judiciary. A major overhaul is taking place that envisages a new judicial geographical map and will result in many courts being abolished or merged. The micro‐governance of courts is also being overhauled, reducing hierarchical structures and moving to a teamwork approach among the different actors in the court system. A cultural shift will have to take place in the next decade in order for the reforms to be successful, but thus far reforms have created considerable protests and dissatisfaction among staff, because consultation has so far been poor (Ministério da Justiça <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>)
         </p>
         
         <p>The government also began to implement the local government reform programme which was designed and decided in November 2011. It envisages the fusion and extinction of 1,500 parishes (the lowest level of local government). The bill also included a reduction of public enterprises at local government by half, the reduction of elected local representatives and a change of the electoral system towards a more majoritarian system (Gabinete do Ministro Adjunto e Assuntos Parlamentares <span><a href="#epdy12027-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12027-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). None of the reforms were completed at the end of 2012, and their implementation is planned to continue during 2013.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12027-sec-0004-title"> Regional elections in the autonomous region of Azores</h2>
         
         <p>The regional elections to the legislative assembly in the autonomous region of Azores were the only major electoral contest in 2012. These elections were regarded as an important test for the popularity of the parties in the conservative coalition government. The Azores archipelago in the mid‐Atlantic is a stronghold for both the PSD and CDS‐PP. The PSD ruled the Azores between 1979 and 1996 with an absolute majority under the leadership of João Bosco Mota Amaral. However, in 1996 the PS was able to achieve an absolute majority and Carlos César became the new regional president. Under César's presidency term limits were placed on the presidency and in César did not campaign again in 2012. Despite a slight improvement by the PSD under new regional leader Berta Cabral and a slight decline in its own share of the vote, the PS was able to keep its absolute majority and gain one seat and César's successor in the PS, Vasco Cordeiro, defeated Cabral for the presidency. The losers of the election were all small parties. The junior coalition partner CDS‐PP lost almost half of its vote and two of its original five seats. The Bloc of the Left lost one‐third of its vote and one seat. The Communists also lost also a significant vote share, but still managed to keep their single seat (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12027-tbl-0002">2</a>). Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho explained the result in the Azores as being related to the national context, while Vice‐Prime Minister Paulo Portas took full responsibility for the poor result of the CDS‐PP and attributed the loss to the austerity policies of the government.

         <p>After the general elections of 5 June 2011 party leader Francisco Louçã face increasing criticism from with his party because of stagnant electoral performance. (In the elections of 2011, BE lost 4.7 percentage points, nearly half of its share in 2009, whereas its main rival, the Communist Party, which was able to remain at 8.2 per cent). Although Louçã's position was not overtly challenged, he announced in August 2012 that he would step down as leader after 13 years in office and he proposed a new two‐person leadership team for BE: 39 year‐old activist and theatre actress Catarina Martins and 61 year‐old former Communist and physician João Semedo. Although some criticised Louçã approach to succession as unnecessarily autocratic, Martins and Semedo were elected as leaders by the Eighth Convention of the Bloc of the Left on 10 and 11 November 2012. This constitutes a new era for the party. It is expected that Louçã will remain a member of the Portuguese parliament, but will dedicate more time to his professorial position at the prestigious public Higher Institute of Economy and Management (Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão, ISEG).</p>
