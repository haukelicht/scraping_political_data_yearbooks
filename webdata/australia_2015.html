         <p>Despite Tony Abbott's comprehensive win over the Labor government in the 2013 election, his position as Prime Minister became increasingly tenuous in 2014 as both the coalition government and its leader languished in the polls. With an increasing number of Liberal parliamentarians worried about their party's prospects for a second term, it was unsurprising that a motion for Abbott to vacate the leadership in advance of a new leadership ballot was put to the party caucus in February 2015. The motion failed, but Abbott faced a second challenge in September 2015, losing the leadership to Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull became Australia's fourth Prime Minister in as many years, and his first few months in office provided the Liberal government with a significant boost in support. However, a hostile Senate and a nervous backbench continued to make policy change difficult leading into the election year of 2016.</p>

         <p>There was no federal election in 2015, but two federal by‐elections were held in the latter part of 2015. The death of sitting Liberal member Donald Randall led to a by‐election in the division of Canning in Western Australia on 19 September. Randall had seconded the spill motion that prompted the February vote on Tony Abbott's leadership. Although the Liberals held the seat, their majority was reduced by 6.5 per cent, making the seat nominally marginal. Nevertheless, the win was reported as a vindication of the decision to replace Abbott with Malcolm Turnbull a week earlier. Before the change of leadership opinion polls were suggesting a 10 per cent swing to Labor, which would have left the Liberals with a 2 per cent margin going into the 2016 election (Wahlquist <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0024" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0024R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>On 5 December, a second by‐election was held, this time in the division of North Sydney. The safe Liberal seat had been held for 19 years by Joe Hockey, who had been Treasurer in the Abbott government from 18 September 2013 until September 2015. Hockey resigned from cabinet after Abbott's demise and refused a position in the Turnbull cabinet. In January 2016, he took up the position of Australian Ambassador to the United States. Trent Zimmerman, a former staffer of Hockey's, won the by‐election, retaining the seat's status as safe, despite a 12.5 per cent swing against the Liberals.

            <p>There were two state‐level elections in 2015. In the New South Wales (NSW) election held on 28 March, the Liberal‐National coalition was returned to power under the leadership of Mike Baird who had replaced Barry O'Farrell 11 months earlier. Labor won 14 seats off the government, and the Greens won an additional two seats, taking their representation to three in the 93‐seat parliament. However, the Liberal‐National coalition retained a majority in both houses. By contrast, the Queensland state election of 31 January produced a change of government in the unicameral parliament, with the Liberal‐National government ousted after just one three‐year term. Labor won 44 seats in the 89‐seat parliament (up from seven seats in 2012), and formed a minority government with the support of an independent. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had been selected party leader unopposed after Anna Bligh's resignation in 2012, became Queensland's second woman premier and the first woman to win the premiership from the opposition. Palaszczuk's cabinet included 50 per cent women and a female deputy premier – two firsts in Australian state politics.</p>

         <p>Although Prime Minister Abbott survived the February challenge to his leadership in 2015 (by 61 votes to 39), this was largely because cabinet stood behind him, and the two potential contenders (Julie Bishop and Malcolm Turnbull) chose not to support the spill motion. Abbott referred to it as a ‘near death experience’, and his closest advisers argued his survival as Prime Minister depended on him replacing his Chief of Staff and Treasurer Joe Hockey (Hartcher <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). Abbott did not take this advice and made no changes to his cabinet. However, he did remove experienced Chief Whip, Philip Ruddock. Some suggested this was to punish Ruddock for not keeping discontented backbenchers in check, but Abbott argued otherwise, stating it was an attempt to refresh and deepen his connection with the backbench (McDonald &amp; Woodley <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0017" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0017R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>).

         <p>The media were correct in their predictions that Abbott was on borrowed time as leader (Grattan <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0014R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). On 14 September, seven months after the failed February motion, Malcolm Turnbull announced he was mounting a challenge for the leadership. Turnbull won the ballot convincingly and made a number of changes to his new cabinet. He increased the size of the inner ministry to 21, and selected three new women, taking the total to five. A number of Abbott supporters were not reappointed (most notably Joe Hockey, Eric Abetz, Kevin Andrews and Ian Macfarlane).

         <p>Despite there being two by‐elections held in 2015, there were no changes to the party or gender composition of the House of Representatives.</p>
         
         <p>However, in 2015 three Senators resigned from office, although the distribution of seats by party did not change with these resignations because Section 15 of the Constitution requires the parliament of the state represented by the vacating senator to select a person of the same party to hold the place until the expiration of the term (Evans <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2008</a></span>). However, the gender composition did change. John Faulkner, Senator for NSW and former minister in three federal governments and opposition leader in the Senate, resigned on 6 February 2015. He was replaced by the Labor Party's national president Jenny McAllister, who had already been pre‐selected for the second (winnable) position on Labor's NSW Senate ticket. Just over a month later, Bruce Mason, a Queensland Liberal‐National Party Senator announced his intention to resign. Mason left the Senate on 15 April and was later appointed Australia's Ambassador to the Netherlands. The resultant casual vacancy was filled by Joanna Lindgren, an Aboriginal Australian and the great‐niece of former Queensland Senator Neville Bonner, the first Indigenous Australian in the federal parliament. Then, on 6 May 2015, Christine Milne stepped down as leader of the Australian Greens, announcing her resignation on Facebook. She was succeeded as leader by Richard Di Natale, a sitting Senator from Victoria and, after her departure from the Senate on 10 August 2015, was replaced by Nick McKim from Tasmania.

         <p>Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the parliamentary year was the resignation of the Speaker, Bronwyn Bishop. Ms Bishop entered parliament in 1987, was twice a minister under John Howard and had been a member of Abbott's shadow outer ministry. She accepted the role of Speaker after being nominated personally by Tony Abbott. However, confidence in her dwindled rapidly in July 2015 when her use of parliamentary expenses was revealed to have included an AUS$5,000 private helicopter rental to fly from Melbourne to a Liberal fundraiser in Geelong. The Prime Minister acknowledged such use of public funds was unacceptable and put Ms Bishop ‘on probation’. However, further investigations revealed at least 15 other instances where Bishop had claimed flights for her work as chair of a standing committee despite no public hearings having been scheduled. The political and media pressure led to Bishop tendering her resignation on 2 August (Medhora <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0018" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0018R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). She was replaced by Liberal backbencher Tony Smith, elected by the Liberal caucus on 9 August. Smith, unlike his predecessor, has chosen to remove himself from party room tactics while he holds the position and no longer attends weekly party meetings.

         <p>The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) requires that the Electoral Commissioner use the latest official published population statistics to determine of the number of members of the House of Representatives to which each state is entitled. This determination takes place on the day after the one‐year anniversary of the first meeting of the House of Representatives (AEC <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>). As a result, in 2015, Federal Electoral Redistribution Committees were established for NSW and Western Australia. While not representing significant institutional change, some boundary adjustments were made to 12 electorates in NSW and the Division of Throsby, also in NSW, was renamed the Division of Whitlam in honour of former Prime Minister, the Honorable Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC who died aged 98 in 2014. However, regional population decline led to the consolidation of the rural electorate of Hunter into the existing Divisions of New England and Paterson, while a new electorate was created in Western Australia (named the Division of Burt) (AEC <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>). The total number of members in the House of Representatives remained at 150.

         <p>In June, the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples released its final report. It recommended the government hold a series of consultations and conventions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and with a broad cross‐section of the community. The committee offered three options on possible new wording and recommended that the referendum on constitutional recognition be held when it has the highest chance of success (JSCCR <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0016" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0016R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). In response, on 7 December, Prime Minister Turnbull and Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten appointed a Referendum Council to progress the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia's Constitution. The Council comprises 16 indigenous and non‐indigenous members, and was assigned a key role in deciding what form of constitutional recognition will be put to Australians in a referendum. Specifically, the Council was charged with drafting a discussion paper to enable general feedback and consultation with indigenous communities (Gordon <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In 2014, the Joint Select Committee Inquiry into the 2013 federal election released a report that included a set of six recommendations for reform to the Senate voting system to address the issue of preference harvesting and the requirement for compulsory preferential voting ‘below the line’. In response, on 22 September 2015, Special Minister of State Mal Brough indicated that he intended to pursue reform of the Senate electoral system (Parliament of Australia <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0022" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0022R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015d</a></span>).<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12115-note-0002_25-controller" href="#epdy12115-note-0002_25" aria-controls="epdy12115-note-0002_25" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Note">2</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12115-note-0002_25" aria-labelledby="epdy12115-note-0002_25-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><span aria-labelledby="Footnote 2" title="Footnote 2"><span class="number">2 </span>New legislation was introduced into parliament on 25 February 2016 with the proposed reforms including the use of above‐the‐line preferential voting and an increase in the number of allowable mistakes below the line from three to five (Anderson &amp; Dziedzic <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).<br></span><span class="chevronDown"></span></span> One objective of the reforms is to reduce the number of micro‐parties elected. In 2014–2015, the number of small parties and independents represented in the Senate (known in Australia as ‘crossbenchers’) reached a record high of 18, up five on the previous high of 13 in 2002–2005.

         <p>Much of 2015 was taken up with the precarious state of Abbott's leadership. Early in 2015, Abbott awarded Prince Phillip a knighthood; he had reintroduced the imperial honours system in 2014. What Abbott called a ‘captain's call’ was to prove unpopular with voters and disturbing to members of his own party. There were also publicly aired concerns about the role his Chief of Staff Peta Credlin was taking in terms of government agenda‐setting (Hartcher <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). Nevertheless, some policy opportunities were taken during his final year in office. Abbott's Operation Sovereign Border was reported as heartless, but it did lead to a decrease in the number of boats arriving on Australian shores between 2014 and 2015 (ABC <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015c</a></span>). The May budget gave generous benefits to small businesses and the harsh measures that had been alluded to did not emerge, while progress was made in the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations. In February, the major polls had put the Liberals at 45 per cent support, ten points behind Labor's 55 per cent. By July, the government had recovered to close the gap to four points (Hartcher <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>However, the Senate continued to block proposed law changes governing the oversight of trade unions, setting up a double dissolution trigger for the federal government (Clarke <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). More generally, it appeared the relationship between Abbott and key micro‐party and independent Senators was an uneasy one, making it difficult for him to appear in control of his government's agenda. It was also Abbott's internal party relationships that contributed to his demise. He continued to announce controversial policy initiatives unilaterally, such as stripping Australians suspected of terrorist offences of their sole citizenship. He allowed the Liberals’ conservative coalition partner, the Nationals, to participate in a caucus vote on whether a conscience vote should be allowed on a private member's bill on marriage equality. This unusual joint‐party vote (66 to 33 in favour of following the party line) prevented Liberal progressive backbenchers from pursuing the issue (Hartcher <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Whether a coup was in the offing made national headlines for a number of months leading up to the actual vote in September, which Turnbull won 54 to 44. His immediate policy impact was limited in part because, like his predecessor, he faced a hostile Senate. He was also hamstrung by the conditions put on him by members from the conservative right faction of the party – conditions which prevented him moving radically on climate change or tax reform. Despite this, in the final quarter of 2015, the Liberals were ahead of Labor by six points in the polls (53 to 47) and Turnbull had an approval rating of 68 per cent (AAP <span title=""><a href="#epdy12115-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12115-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). By early 2016, election dates were being discussed, with August or September considered the most likely. A double dissolution election was also being touted as a possibility by both government ministers and media commentators.
