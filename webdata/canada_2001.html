         <p>After nearly a decade of easy sailing against a divided opposition, 2002 proved to be a year in which the Liberal Government became its own worst enemy and veered off track. Prime Minister Chrétien, who had long boasted about the stability of his cabinet, faced a series of internal political challenges that forced him to make significant changes to his government four times during the year. All of these changes could be traced to challenges to the political morality of his ministers, the growing leadership succession battle in the Liberal party, or some combination of the two.</p>
         
         <p>From its very beginning in 1993, the Prime Minister made the unquestionable integrity of his cabinet members a cornerstone of the administration. Now well into its third term, the Government's propensity to reward its friends was becoming harder to hide. The whole question of patronage was highlighted by continuing questions about government agency financial support to organizations in which Mr Chrétien had once held an interest (and some argued still did). With the press harping on the matter, the issue of patronage took on a heightened sensitivity for the Government. Any minister who attracted attention to the question was a reminder of the Prime Minister's difficulties and had to be dealt with more aggressively than in the past. At the same time, the Prime Minister started the year with questions about how long he intended to remain in politics at the top of most Liberals’ agendas. A number of senior ministers were eyeing the job and organizing their supporters in the party. Paul Martin, the Minister of Finance (and the man Chrétien had defeated for the leadership in 1990), was well in front in this unofficial race. This set him up as the obvious alternate pole for caucus and party members unhappy with Chrétien. It also left Martin's potential leadership opponents very anxious to start vigorously organizing their own campaigns. This configuration of internal party forces was inevitably very destabilizing.</p>
         
         <p>The first shock to the Government came in early January when the Minister of Industry announced he was quitting politics because he believed the road to the leadership was effectively blocked by the Martin forces. As he had only recently left the premiership of Newfoundland to return to national politics at the Prime Minister's urging, this was a major blow to Chrétien's ability to keep his challengers balanced against one another. Simultaneously under pressure to deal with the patronage proclivities of one of his most loyal ministers, the Prime Minister was forced into a reconstruction of the Government. In unseemly haste the long‐serving Deputy Prime Minister was pushed into retirement to make space, the offending Public Works Minister was sent into exile as Ambassador to Denmark, four new members were brought into the cabinet, and many others shuffled in an effort to position one or two of them as counters to Finance Minister Martin. The real consequence was to confirm the perception that Martin had a stranglehold on the succession, which emboldened his supporters to push for Chrétien's early departure. Given that the Prime Minister was facing a vote to confirm his leadership at the forthcoming party convention, this heightened the organizational battles going on within the party.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The media spent much of the spring focused on the internal machinations within the Liberal Party while turning accounts of patronage contracts and personal contacts into major stories attacking the Government. When it became known that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were investigating several of the allegations, the Prime Minister was again forced to respond, and, on a Sunday afternoon in late May, suddenly fired his Defence Minister and shuffled two others – ironically, back to the very offices they had held before the January cabinet reconstruction. However, it was on the very next Sunday afternoon that the big political explosion occurred. The Prime Minister announced that, unable to work any longer with the Minister of Finance, he had accepted his resignation. For his part, Martin reported that he had first heard this news on his car radio leaving the impression that he had been summarily fired. What was clear was that the party was now openly divided and Martin was free to seek the leadership actively.</p>
         
         <p>During the summer recess, the pressure on the Prime Minister to declare his intentions escalated as several Members of Parliament (MPs) openly called for his resignation. Wanting to avoid the humiliation of a negative party vote, and to control the timing of his departure, Mr Chrétien finally announced his plans at a private caucus meeting in August. He declared that he had no intention of leading the party into another election and would step down in February 2004 when he turned 70 and would have achieved all that he had promised. This left the party, and country, with the prospect of a lame duck leader for the next eighteen months. The Liberal Party, pleased to have avoided the prospect of an internal political bloodbath, heaved a great sigh of relief and prepared to carry on as if all was normal.</p>
         
         <p>However, the third cabinet change had not ended the Government's troubles. In October, the Solicitor General came under attack for alleged patronage dealings in his home province and the Prime Minister was forced to make yet another change. Given that political convention dictated that he replace the offending minister with someone from the same province (which only has four representatives in the House), no one thought that the Government had really been strengthened. Throughout the fall, the Martinites kept the pressure on as they sought to build overwhelming support for their champion. The battle was fought on two fronts: in the party organization, Martin's supporters worked to ensure that membership rules worked to their advantage by making it difficult for other candidates to sign up supporters; in the caucus, MPs who supported Martin pushed for a loosening of Chrétien's tight parliamentary discipline and control. Martin himself made a major speech in October in which he charged that Canada faced a ‘democratic deficit’ rooted in the excessive power in the Prime Minister's office and proposing a six‐point plan to counter it. His supporters responded a couple of weeks later (with the support of opposition MPs) by voting to change the rules of the House to ensure that they, and not the Prime Minister, would determine who chaired Commons’ committees. By the end of the year, observers were left wondering if a real contest for the Liberal leadership (and so the premiership) would develop, and whether the Prime Minister would spend the next year as an enervated place‐warmer rather than the powerful boss he had been for a decade.</p>
         
         <p>Opposition politicians played little part in these dramas and, with the political media transfixed by the governing party's internal battles, they were largely ignored. The leader of the Conservatives, who was also facing a party conference vote on his leadership, made it clear in August that he would resign before the next election, but announced he would stay until the spring of 2003 by when, it was hoped, the Liberal's leadership situation would be clearer. This had the advantage of buying him more time as leader while avoiding a potentially divisive and embarrassing vote. The New Democratic Party's leader announced that she too would step down and the party prepared to elect a successor by an every‐member direct vote for the first time in its history. That contest was well under way by the end of the year but, to the party's great frustration, attracted almost no attention outside partisan circles.</p>
         
         <p>For most of 2001, the Alliance Party dominated the political news (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>). Struggling to contain its own internal conflicts, the party finally held a (every‐member vote) leadership contest in March. As is usual with these campaigns in Canadian parties, membership grew significantly as the four contestants mobilized personal supporters. Although the membership doubled over the course of the campaign, it reached only half its total during the 2000 general election. With the easy victory of Stephen Harper as the new leader, most of the MPs who had left the caucus during 2001 returned home. Perhaps more significantly, the contest revealed that almost 60 per cent of the party's members resided in the country's two westernmost provinces. Though the country's official Opposition, the party remained stuck as a regional protest vehicle. It was precisely this Alliance failure to develop as a genuinely national political organization and alternate government that left the Liberals unchallenged and free to concentrate on their own internal leadership struggles.

         <p>With all these party pyrotechnics lighting the stage one might have been forgiven for thinking little else was enlivening political debate. In fact, several issues divided Canadians and their MPs. Early in the year, the Government announced that it intended to proceed with a major overhaul of the Indian Act that regulates much of the life of the country's aboriginal peoples. However, two major sticking points exist: the Government wants greater transparency and accountability in the use of public funds by the country's many different aboriginal bands, and it needs to obtain some kind of agreement to the changes from the aboriginal leadership. There is little real prospect that the fundamental issues governing the relationships between aboriginal peoples and the rest of the country are going to be solved easily or quickly. In British Columbia, the provincial government's mail‐in referendum on the principles that ought to govern treaty settlements in the province was bitterly opposed by the aboriginal communities and seemed only to aggravate relationships.</p>
         
         <p>Canada signed the Kyoto Accord on the environment when it was drafted in 1997. That committed the country to cutting gas emissions to 6 per cent below 1990 rates by 2012 – something that would require cuts of 20 to 30 per cent from current consumption levels. Although the United States, with which Canada is economically intertwined in a free trade partnership, opted out of the agreement, the cabinet decided that it would force a vote in the House to ratify the Accord. Not surprisingly, this started a fierce political struggle, with the government of oil‐rich Alberta and the energy industry leading the attack. By December, the Government had made enough concessions to various governments and industries that it was able to muster sufficient support to pass its motion.</p>
         
         <p>Late in the year, the Government received the much‐awaited report of the Royal Commission on the state of the healthcare system, chaired by the former premier of Saskatchewan. Not surprisingly, it called for a reaffirmation of a publicly funded healthcare system and the annual transfer of billions of more dollars from the federal treasury to the provinces that operate it. Even less surprisingly, the provincial premiers claimed that more money than that would be needed simply to maintain the existing system, and they called on the national government to increase its contributions immediately. As healthcare regularly appears at the top of the poll when Canadians are asked about their concerns, this issue will not go away and is likely to be at the centre of major federal‐provincial conflict and bargaining over the coming years. Finally, reversing his earlier position, the Minister of Justice stated that the Government was looking at ways to deal with marijuana. After decades in which recreational drug use has become common, the Minister said: ‘We’re not talking about making it legal, we’re talking about the possibility of moving ahead with what we call de‐criminalization.’ The record of past governments on this issue suggests there is likely to be more talking than moving ahead. Yet, given the uncertain prospect of the country's Liberal leadership for 2003, anything might happen.</p>
