            <p>Last year's entry (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006a</a></span>) argued that: ‘There is every reason to believe that [Kim] Beazley will lead Labor into the next election, due towards the end of 2007.’ That prediction turned out to be a poor one. The other opposition parties retained their leaders – Senator Lyn Allison for the Democrats and Senator Bob Brown for the Greens – but at the very end of the year, Labor made a change at the top.
            </p>
            
            <p>Kim Beazley had been Labor leader (and therefore Leader of the Opposition) from March 1996 to November 2001 and from January 2005 to December 2006: a total of seven and a half years. Historically it is substantially the case that Labor leaders serve longest as Leader of the Opposition, while leaders of the Liberal Party serve longest as Prime Minister. There have been only two men (both Labor) to serve longer as Leader of the Opposition than Beazley, one of whom was Gough Whitlam whose eleven‐year tenure made him the party's longest serving leader.</p>
            
            <p>The story of how Beazley came to be toppled from his position is a long one. There were a series of trivial misjudgments. None of these would have mattered if they had occurred singly. However, their cumulative effect was to induce a feeling of gloom among the members of Labor's caucus. Then, in mid‐November, came an opinion poll judged to be unusually bad. Then followed the challenge with Kevin Rudd taking on Kim Beazley as leader and Julia Gillard challenging incumbent Jenny Macklin for the position of deputy. On Monday, 4 December, the caucus members cast their votes: 49 for Rudd and 39 for Beazley. Julia Gillard was elected deputy unopposed.</p>
            
            <p>Opinion polls following the caucus showed very favourable results for the new leadership team (dubbed the ‘dream team’ by many in the media) and several commentators started to express optimism for Labor's chances at the general election due towards the end of 2007 (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006b</a></span>; <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Brent 2006</a></span>). However, not all forecasts went that way. The chief federal politics journalist for <i>The Australian</i> newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, wrote a week later (<span title=""><a href="#b10" id="#b10R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Shanahan 2006</a></span>) that one should ‘expect John Howard to lose seats but still win a federal election in late October or early November’. His detailed reasoning was:
            </p>
            
            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Rudd can expect to pick up seats in Queensland, his home state, South Australia and New South Wales, and even win back one in Tasmania, but if he wins it will be a victory of tsunami‐like proportions. It is more likely he will win back a clutch of seats to cement his position as Opposition Leader and put the pressure back on the Liberal leadership in 2008.</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>One of the first things Rudd did was to re‐shuffle his shadow cabinet. In this exercise he displayed the kind of ruthlessness lacking in Kim Beazley. He promoted proven talent from the back bench and rid himself of poor performers. All this led to speculation that John Howard would respond by re‐shuffling his own cabinet early in 2007.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> Government re‐shuffle</h3>
            
            <p>In fact, a re‐shuffle had taken place at the beginning of 2006, on 27 January. It was occasioned by the fact that South Australian Senator Robert Hill (then Minister for Defence and Leader of the Government in the Senate) resigned to become Australian Ambassador to the United Nations. Prime Minister Howard, however, made more changes than required merely to replace him. The poorly‐performing Victorian Senator Kay Patterson (then Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) was dropped, creating a second vacancy.</p>
            
            <p>The consequential effect was that Senator Nick Minchin, Minister for Finance and Administration, was promoted from Deputy Leader to Leader of the Government in the Senate, while Senator Helen Coonan, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, was promoted to Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Defence portfolio was filled by Dr Brendan Nelson, promoted from having been Minister for Education, Science and Training. His place was taken by the newcomer from Western Australia, Julie Bishop, who was also given the title of ‘Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues’.</p>
            
            <p>Senator Amanda Vanstone had been Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Her portfolio was split so she became simply Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The portfolio of Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs was taken by the newcomer from Queensland, Mal Brough.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> Howard and the Senate</h3>
            
            <p>Several previous entries have discussed both Australia's perceived problem with asylum‐seekers and the fact that Howard lacked a majority in the Senate during his first three terms. Both problems appeared to have been solved; in the case of asylum‐seekers by tough action taken in the second half of 2001, and in the case of the Senate by the simple fact that the October 2004 general election result gave Howard majorities in both houses. However, an unexpected development arose in January 2006 when 43 West Papuan boat people landed on the Cape York peninsula in northern Queensland and were later granted what are known as ‘temporary protection visas’ by Australia. This is where the Department of Immigration decides that the claimant has a well‐founded fear of persecution. The visas were granted in March.</p>
            
            <p>The Australian decision outraged the Indonesian government. The 43 West Papuans, they averred, were part of the campaign to give independence to West Papua (which had been incorporated into Indonesia by invasion in 1963). Indonesia claimed that the decision meant the Australian government was conniving to assist the break‐up of Indonesia, and withdrew its ambassador in protest. The argument was that the presence of such people in Australia was designed to inflame Australian public opinion against Indonesia.</p>
            
            <p>Howard's reaction was to placate Indonesia by attempting legislation designed to strengthen even further its hard‐line policy against asylum‐seekers who arrive by boat. The legislation was entitled the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. The technical details are not important. What is important is that the arrival of boat people normally creates public opinion hostile to refugees who are characterized as ‘queue jumpers’. In this case, however, that hostility was offset by an equal hostility towards any attempt by Howard to kowtow to Indonesian demands.</p>
            
            <p>In the House of Representatives, the bill passed in early August by a margin much lower than the government's normal majority. The reason was that three Coalition backbenchers actually crossed the floor to vote with Labor against the bill and there were three further conspicuous Coalition abstentions. Howard's Senate majority was small enough that he made enquiries as to the intentions of his senators. When he realized that the revolt would be big enough to doom the bill, he decided to drop the matter altogether. He did not want the humiliation of defeat in the Senate by rebels who normally would be expected to support his government.</p>
            
            <p>Asylum‐seekers raise passions on both the left and the right in Australia. What was unusual about this case was that the perception of pandering to Indonesia (a very unpopular country in Australia – and the feeling is mutual) had the unusual effect of creating majority sympathy for the refugees. One of the Coalition rebels (John Forrest, member for the Victorian rural seat of Mallee) replied to those who (like the present author) wrote to congratulate him on his principled stand (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Forrest 2006</a></span>), by noting that:

<p>To those of you who have so strongly disagreed with my position I say thank you for participating in our democracy which we are just so privileged to have here in Australia. For those who've written in support thank you also. There have been some encouraging messages through a tough time.</p>

            <p>Last year's entry in the <i>Political Data Yearbook</i> (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006a</a></span>) noted how Howard's Senate majority had made it possible for him to achieve a long‐held ambition: so‐called ‘labour market reform’ or ‘the deregulation of the labour market’:

<p>No sooner had Howard won his Senate majority than he announced an industrial relations revolution. No notice of this had been given during the 2004 general election campaign. When the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) mounted an advertising campaign (paid for from its own resources), Howard responded with a AUS$55 million taxpayer‐funded campaign of his own. The ACTU argued that this campaign should have been funded by the Liberal Party since there was not even legislation on the table to implement the changes. Unfortunately for the ACTU, the High Court held that this spending of public money was permitted by the Australian Constitution. Both sides considered the other's advertisements (in newspapers, on radio and on television) to be dishonest.</p>
<p>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 is universally regarded as the most important piece of legislation passed during the year. Its opponents regard it as a revolution designed simply to enhance the power of employers and weaken that of trade unions and, therefore, of individual employees. The government describes the Act as bringing about ‘measured changes’ to strengthen the economy. The Act, which stretches to nearly 700 pages, was passed by the Senate (and received royal assent) in December.</p>

            <p>There was a sequel in 2006. As soon as the legislation actually commenced (on 27 March – coinciding nicely with the commemoration of ten years of John Howard as Prime Minister), the states launched a High Court challenge to its constitutional validity. Six days were set aside for hearings in May, and the states were joined by a number of trade unions in the proceedings. On 14 November, the High Court, by a five to two majority, dismissed their challenges.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss6"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss6-title"> Howard's problem with AWB</h3>
            
            <p>The most commonly occurring letters in headlines throughout the year were ‘AWB’. They dominated all the way from January to November, when a sigh of relief came over the government. The Australian Wheat Board was established in 1939 as a monopoly government‐run exporter of wheat. It was a statutory authority and part of the generally accepted concept of the day under the heading ‘organized marketing of primary products’. Its purpose was to produce price stabilization for wheat growers who had been hard hit by the depression of the 1930s. After a very successful period as a statutory authority, the fashion for privatization caused the AWB to become a private company in stages over the period 1998–2001. There continued to be a Wheat Export Authority, but the commercial arm was privatized with a certain class of shares reserved for wheat growers, while others were made available to the general public. Its website now says that ‘AWB Limited is Australia's leading agribusiness and one of the world's largest wheat marketing and management companies’. Had it not been for the American‐led invasion of Iraq, AWB would still be a highly regarded and profitable company and its shares would probably be about three times the price they are today. However, George W. Bush changed all that. An unintended effect of the invasion was to help American wheat growers in their quest for markets with their Australian competitors.</p>
            
            <p>Paul Volcker was the chairman of the United States Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987. However, that is not why he has become a household name in Australia. Rather it is because the aftermath of the invasion saw him appointed to find out the truth behind the Iraq oil‐for‐food scandal. This was the scheme organized by the United Nations as a goodwill program to spare ordinary Iraqis some of the bitter hardships that their leaders had brought upon them. The problem was that the apparent success of this UN program was more than overshadowed by a set of fraudulent transactions that enriched the Iraqi dictator's regime to the tune of well over US$100 billion. According to the report issued by Volcker's independent commission in November 2005, there had been 139 companies paying oil ‘surcharges’ and 2,253 companies paying humanitarian kickbacks.</p>
            
            <p>It was established that AWB had paid about US$222 million ($290 million Australian dollars) in kickbacks to Iraq's former dictator Saddam Hussein to secure sales contracts. This made AWB the biggest single offender of them all and, according to Volcker, accounted for 14 per cent of all the payments in defiance of UN sanctions. Since Australia was at war with Saddam, these payments were labeled by the Australian Opposition as the ‘wheat‐for‐weapons’ scandal. Disreputable countries could get away with doing nothing about the fact that some of their private companies were helping to pay for Saddam's army; however, Australia is a reputable country. Moreover, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and Poland, our troops invaded Iraq. Consequently the ‘oil‐for‐food’ or ‘wheat‐for‐weapons’ scandal could not be ignored. Therefore, John Howard announced the establishment of an investigation headed by Justice Terence Cole, entitled ‘Inquiry into certain Australian Companies in relation to the UN Oil‐for‐Food Programme 2005‐06’. Cole heard from many witnesses, including the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade, the Foreign Minister, numerous bureaucrats, foreign officials and, above all, from executives of the companies in question (essentially AWB).</p>
            
            <p>Late in November, Cole's report was published. The first three paragraphs of the report in <i>The Australian</i> (<span title=""><a href="#b9" id="#b9R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Overington 2006b</a></span>) convey the substance of it:

               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Eleven former executives of wheat exporter AWB could face criminal charges and jail terms of up to ten years after the Cole inquiry found they had engaged in an elaborate deception that illegally funneled $290 million to Saddam Hussein's regime and cast a shadow over Australia's international reputation.</p>
<p>A 2065‐page report by Commissioner Terence Cole, tabled in federal parliament yesterday, named former AWB chairman Trevor Flugge and former executives Mark Emons, Peter Geary, Dominic Hogan, Paul Ingleby, Michael Long, Nigel Officer, Murray Rogers, Charles Stott, Michael Watson and Jim Cooper as being involved in the kickbacks scheme, in which illicit payments were disguised as trucking fees to Jordanian company Alia. . . . </p>

            <p>If the government got off scot‐free, the same cannot be said of the poor Australian wheat grower. American wheat growers had been incensed about their losses at the hands of their Australian competitors, the Americans having suffered for doing the right thing on sanctions. However, in 2006, Australian wheat growers lost AUS$800 million in export deals after Iraq suspended its relationship with AWB (<span title=""><a href="#b8" id="#b8R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Overington 2006a</a></span>).

            <p>March 2002 witnessed the end of a process that had been going on for some years. It is now the case that all six State Premiers and both Territory Chief Ministers are from the Labor Party – namely the party constituting the federal Opposition. In order of seniority, these Labor leaders of the States/Territories now are: Peter Beattie (Queensland, gaining office in June 1998), Steve Bracks (Victoria, October 1999), Clare Martin (Northern Territory, August 2001), Jon Stanhope (Australian Capital Territory, November 2001), Mike Rann (South Australia, March 2002), Paul Lennon (Tasmania, March 2004, who succeeded upon the death of Labor's Jim Bacon), Morris Iemma (New South Wales, August 2005) and Alan Carpenter (Western Australia, January 2006).</p>
            
            <p>It will be noticed from the above list that the office of Premier of Western Australia changed in January 2006. Geoff Gallop (Labor) had been Premier since February 2001 when he led his party into government with a general election victory. However, he resigned his office (and from politics altogether) after discovering he was suffering from clinical depression. The 54 year‐old former Rhodes Scholar had hidden his illness while running the state. A typical comment was this one from <span title=""><a href="#b11" id="#b11R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mike Steketee (2006</a></span>) of <i>The Australian</i>:

            <p>
               
               </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Voluntary departures from politics are unusual enough but they are even rarer for politicians at the pinnacle of their power. . . . It is a measure of the seriousness of his illness and his courage in confronting it, that Geoff Gallop is leaving when his political prospects have never looked better.</p>
                  <div class="source"></div>
               </blockquote>
               
            
            
            <p>The Labor caucus met and chose the State Development Minister, Alan Carpenter, to be Gallop's successor. Like Morris Iemma in New South Wales, Carpenter is a Premier yet to win a general election in his own right.</p>
            
            <p>There were four State general elections during the year. Before giving their results it is worthwhile to note that the constitutional arrangements of the States vary. Some States have fixed election dates, while others allow the Premier the right of an early election simply by advising the Governor of the State to dissolve the lower house of parliament. So, as we entered the year, it was known that the South Australian general election would be held on 18 March and the Victorian on 25 November. The dates for Queensland and Tasmania were not known. In the event, the Premier of Tasmania, Paul Lennon, sprung an early election on 18 March and the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, sprung one on 9 September. This created the chance happening of two State elections on the same day – a rarity and the first such double event since 1986.</p>
            
            <p>All four Labor governments were handsomely re‐elected. There was, however, a difference. Whereas I had correctly predicted the results in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, I underestimated Labor rather badly in Queensland (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006c</a></span>). There long appeared to be significant dissatisfaction with Labor in Queensland over issues such as their handling of the health system and their lack of a serious response to the nationwide drought that had very severe effects in southern Queensland. In the event, however, it seemed not to matter. The Opposition parties (National and Liberal) were so disunited, they handed Beattie another big victory on a plate.
            </p>
            
            <p>The year 2007 will see two general elections in Australia: New South Wales will go to the polls on the fixed date of 24 March and the federal election will probably be in October–November. If, as I predict, Labor wins both elections, then all nine jurisdictions will have Labor in office, which has never happened before. However, the reverse has occurred. From May 1969 to June 1970, there were no Labor governments. Labor's then drought was broken by the party's return in South Australia. If 2008 sees the situation wherein the Liberal Party is out of office everywhere, then March 2009 may see their drought broken. Western Australia is due to go to the polls then and the new Premier may fail to be elected in his own right.</p>
