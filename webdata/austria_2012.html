         <p>No national or regional elections took place in 2012. In opinion polls, the Social Democratic Party, in coalition government with the People's Party, remained the strongest party throughout the year, whereas the People's Party more than once had to battle with the Freedom Party for second place. The creation of Team Stronach – a new right‐leaning parliamentary party – during the year helped to establish the People's Party in second place again. Supporters of the new party were mostly drawn from the voter base of the Freedom Party and of the Alliance for the Future of Austria. The government parties' combined share of projected votes repeatedly dropped below the 50 per cent level.</p>

         <p>The cabinet's composition remained unchanged. The work of a parliamentary committee of enquiry tested the People's Party's loyalty to the coalition with the Social Democratic Party, but it preferred abiding by the coalition treaty to the risk of premature elections. The Social Democratic Party also had an incentive to preserve the peace. No alternative coalition of two parties was viable except an alliance with the Freedom Party, which was ruled out by the party.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12001-sec-0004"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12001-sec-0004-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Set up in 2011 with an exceptionally wide mandate ranging over seven different topics of enquiry, the activities of the parliamentary ‘Investigating Committee for the Clarification of Allegations of Corruption’ surpassed the low expectations at its start (Jenny <span title=""><a href="#epdy12001-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12001-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 38–39). The committee closed, however, on a low note in October 2012 after setting several records. It held 53 days of committee hearings, invited 132 respondents (politicians, government officials, lobbyists and business executives) and was provided with approximately 1.6 million pages of governmental records. Due to the conflict between government and opposition parties, however, the committee produced no written report.
         </p>
         
         <p>Its topics covered events dating back to several previous governments: the coalitions between the People's Party and Freedom Party (Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) since 2005) ruling in Austria from 1999 to 2006 and the grand coalition government of the Social Democratic Party and People's Party from 2006 to 2008. The Greens, who had constantly been in opposition, were given chair of the investigating committee. The committee studied charges of illicit pay‐offs and perks for parties provided by the partly state‐owned Telekom Austria, kickback payments for lease contracts and the privatisation of a public housing company, as well as the procurement of an emergency service radio network, lavish advertising campaigns by state‐owned companies and government ministries, business efforts to influence a reform of the state's monopoly on gambling, and alleged sales of Austrian citizenship awards.</p>
         
         <p>Several ex‐ministers from the FPÖ, BZÖ and ÖVP parties had to testify as witnesses before the committee during the first half of year – some repeatedly. The investigating committee's slow pace of hearings and the constant stream of negative publicity increasingly irritated the ruling coalition of the Social Democratic Party and People's Party, due to face national elections in 2013. By the parliamentary recess in July, three of the seven topics had not yet been dealt with. The Social Democratic Party stalled with regard to calling Federal Chancellor Werner Faymann as a witness. He was accused of exerting pressure on the public railroad and the motorways company during his previous stint as Minister of Transport to run advertising campaigns that showed him in a positive light. The People's Party was not prepared to end the coalition treaty by siding with the opposition and facing premature elections.</p>
         
         <p>The committee chairwoman Gabriela Moser from the Greens stumbled over a procedural issue in September. She resigned and was replaced by Walter Rosenkranz from the Freedom Party. When inter‐party negotiations over the committee's remaining timetable and list of witnesses failed, the government parties played hardball with the opposition. Its delegation leaders in the committee introduced a motion to close down committee activities within the next two days unless the opposition accepted a heavily curtailed list of committee sessions and witnesses. These included the Social Democratic Secretary of State Josef Ostermayer, who had been Faymann's chief of cabinet, and Minister of Agriculture Nikolaus Berlakovich from the People's Party as the only two members of the current government who would testify on their ministries' advertising campaigns, but not the Federal Chancellor himself. Facing sure defeat in a plenary vote, the opposition parties conceded. The investigating committee rushed through the remaining topics and hearings and officially closed in mid‐October with an oral report given by the committee chairman.</p>
         
         <p>Parliament passed a bundle of anti‐corruption laws – nicknamed the ‘transparency package’ – in June. A second source of inspiration apart from the investigating committee's work was a list of recommendations issued by the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO). The reform established a new public register of individuals and organisations that provide lobbying services and interest representation (<a href="http://www.lobbyreg.justiz.gv.at" class="linkBehavior">www.lobbyreg.justiz.gv.at</a>). Regulations in criminal law on non‐admissible relations with ‘office holders’ were tightened. The definition of the latter now also includes the staff of public companies and institutions controlled by the national audit office. Managers of these entities had repeatedly succumbed to pressure by national or regional politicians to provide financial or other forms of support to a political party.
         </p>
         
         <p>Rules on parties and party finances were thoroughly revised. The Ministry of Interior Affairs was given a deadline of mid‐2013 to set up a public register of Austrian political parties. Parties have to make their statutes available online. Their yearly statement of account to the audit office has to list donors contributing more than €3,500. Any contribution surpassing €50,000 has to be immediately reported to the audit office, which publishes the amounts and donors on its website (<a href="http://www.rechnungshof.gv.at/beratung/parteispenden.html" class="linkBehavior">www.rechnungshof.gv.at/beratung/parteispenden.html</a>). Reporting requirements extend to donations given to a party's candidates and MPs and to party‐affiliated organisations and companies. MPs must provide more information on their yearly income and list unsalaried organisational leadership positions on their personal parliamentary webpage. Parties not complying with the new rules can be sanctioned by the audit office. While there are no limits on giving financial contributions to political parties, a new spending limit restricts parties to spend a maximum amount of €7 million during the last two months of a national election campaign.
         </p>
         
         <p>Austria has one of the most generous regimes of public party financing in advanced industrial democracies. Reimbursement of electoral campaign costs after a national election based on votes gained has been one of its pillars. This type of one‐off payment was abolished for national elections, but kept for elections to the European Parliament. For yearly public party subsidies distributed by territorial entities, the admissible amount was set to a minimum of €3.10 and a maximum of €11 per eligible voter at the national and municipal level and double these numbers at the Land level. Overall, public party financing increased as the yearly subsidies to parliamentary parties were also raised. The increase was defended as necessary to make up for an expected decline in private sector contributions due to the greater transparency imposed. Constitutional clauses in existing regulations made the government dependent on the support of opposition parties to attain a two‐thirds majority in parliament. Support for the reforms was alternatively provided by the Greens or the Freedom Party.</p>
         
         <p>The ‘transparency package’ constitutes a major step in combating political corruption in Austria. Revelations of past practices, however, continued to make headlines during the second half of the year (see below). The yearly Corruption Perceptions Index published by the nongovernmental organisation Transparency International in December showed Austria slipping further down in the ranking of the world's least corrupt states. In 2011 the country had been ranked at number 16, in 2012 it was at number 25. The loss of nine places is the largest year‐to‐year slide among the group of advanced industrial democracies.</p>
         
         <p>In August the two government parties agreed to settle their disagreement over the nation's future defence policy through a consultative referendum that would be accepted as binding. The Social Democratic Party advocated a switch towards a professional army and the People's Party wanted to maintain compulsory military service, but the consequences of reform extend beyond defence policy. Social service organisations rely on cheap manpower provided by the alternative civilian service (Jenny <span title=""><a href="#epdy12001-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12001-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 39). During the remainder of the year the parties haggled over the wording of the two options that would be presented to the electorate in January 2013.
         </p>
         
         <p>In autumn the number of party groups in the Austrian parliament increased from five to six, due to a new party named ‘Team Stronach’. The formation of a new party was announced in August by octogenarian Austro‐Canadian billionaire Frank Stronach, who had immigrated as a young man to Canada and made a fortune in the automobile industry. In the 1980s his industrial group Magna International established its European headquarters in Austria after acquiring the vehicle manufacturer Steyr‐Daimler Puch. Through sports sponsorship (he was president of the Austrian Soccer League from 1999 to 2005) and announcements of grand projects (of which, some never came to fruition), Stronach quickly became a public person. He also raised eyebrows by providing employment to ex‐politicians from across the political spectrum in his industrial group. At the beginning of 2012 he starred as a commentator on domestic politics in the Sunday magazine of the largest Austrian newspaper <i>Kronen Zeitung</i>. The engagement ended when he entered politics – a step that had been expected for some time.
         </p>
         
         <p>Initial talks with representatives from the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) in parliament, and the Liberal Forum – a former parliamentary party – failed. Their positions on economic and social policy would have been closest to the party founder's own vision of economic liberalism, which he combines with a strong dose of euroscepticism. Stronach initially called for giving up the euro in favour of a return to national currencies. A national MP from the Social Democratic Party was the first of eventually six national MPs who joined the new party. He was followed by two non‐attached MPs who had formerly been members of the BZÖ. These three MPs together enabled the new party to easily pass a first hurdle for participation in the next national election, due in 2013. A nationwide candidacy requires the signatures of three sitting MPs or, alternatively, of 2,600 citizens. Public interest then focused on whether Stronach would manage to unglue additional defectors from their parties.</p>
         
         <p>A number of parliamentary instruments require at least five MPs to sign off. The same number is also required for official recognition of a group of MPs as a parliamentary ‘Klub’. Klub status entitles representation in the parliament's leadership body and its standing committees, allocation of plenary speaking time, parliamentary offices and staff and public subsidy for parliamentary parties.</p>
         
         <p>The primary targets for headhunting were MPs from the BZÖ, because surveys put its ability to surpass the 4 per cent national threshold in the next parliamentary election into doubt. The second reason was that an application for recognition as a Klub by a newly formed group of MPs from different parties requires approval by a majority vote in parliament. However, the clause does not apply for a group of MPs elected from the same party list. At the end of September ‘Team Stronach’ was able to submit an application signed by five ex‐BZÖ MPs. The former Social Democratic MP, who had joined the party first, was not among the signatories. Due to the precedent set by the recognition of the Liberal Forum – a split‐off of five MPs from the Freedom Party in 1993 – the president of parliament reluctantly accorded ‘Team Stronach’ Klub status in November.</p>
         
         <p>The party's slogan is ‘truth, transparency and fairness’. The party statutes establish chairman Stronach as a rather autocratic party leader. In interviews on state television he presented himself as a combative, headstrong personality unaccustomed or unwilling to abide by standard norms of interaction between politicians and journalists. Surveys project that the new party will be able to pass the 4 per cent threshold in next year's national elections. Catering to a protest vote, it competes with the Freedom Party and BZÖ – further diminishing the latter's prospects of re‐entering parliament.</p>
         
         <p>Two issues from regional politics merit reporting as both led to the scheduling of premature regional elections. The first one was a court trial on alleged siphoning off of public money by government parties in Carinthia. The second one was a financial scandal that implicated the Land government in Salzburg. A surprise confession in a court trial in July confirmed long‐running rumours about illicit side deals that had accompanied the sale of Carinthia's publicly owned bank Hypo Alpe Adria to Bavarian state bank Bayern LB in 2007. (To prevent its imminent collapse, Hypo Alpe Adria had to be bought back and nationalised by the Austrian federal government in 2009.) A tax consultant had acted as a middle man in the scheme by charging a grossly exaggerated consultancy fee (initially €12 million, quickly reduced to €6 million after public protests at the time), whose lion's share was supposed to end up in the coffers of the Carinthian Alliance for the Future of Austria (which later transformed into the Freedomite Party in Carinthia, FPK) and the People's Party. The ploy had been devised by their respective party leaders, Jörg Haider and Josef Martinz, who were coalition partners in the Carinthian Land government.</p>
         
         <p>After Haider died in a car accident in 2008, however, the parties did not collect any money, apart from €90,000 handed to Martinz in person. At the beginning of 2012 Martinz resigned his government office as it became clear that he would be prosecuted in court, but he denied the charges. After the tax consultant's confession he immediately resigned the chairmanship and left the party. All four defendants in the trial (the remaining two were directors of the Land's holding company that had paid the consultancy fee) were sentenced to prison. The new chairman of the People's Party – national MP Gabriel Obernosterer – agreed with the Social Democratic Party and Greens in opposition to hold a snap election. The three parties together controlled a majority in the regional parliament, but the FPK (as the largest party winning 17 out of 36 seats in the last election in 2009) still had the power to filibuster.</p>
         
         <p>At the time of the consultancy fee trial several members of the FPK leadership were already embattled by judicial investigations. Party chairman and deputy Land governor Uwe Scheuch was named in the trial as one of two current FPK government members who had contacted the tax consultant to demand the party's share of the deal. Recently, Scheuch had been punished with a fine in a separate trial – the so‐called ‘Part of the Game’ affair. He had offered Austrian citizenship to a Russian investor in exchange for economic investment in Carinthia coupled with a donation to the party as ‘part of the game’. He resigned his offices at the beginning of August and was replaced by his brother Kurt Scheuch, the FPK's previous parliamentary party's chairman. Against the backdrop of a steep fall in public opinion, the FPK wanted to delay a new election as long as possible and blocked a vote on parliament's dissolution through absenteeism, thereby denying the 50 per cent quorum of attendance. During the second half of the year FPK MPs left the plenary twelve times until the party finally agreed in December to schedule regional elections for March 2013.</p>
         
         <p>A snap election will also be held in Salzburg, where news broke at the end of November of a speculation scandal in the Land government. A failure of administrative and political oversight had enabled a single trader in the Land's financial department to disguise huge risks from trading in derivatives for years. She was deposed in summer, accused of not abiding by an advisory council's guidelines. Her successor discovered trades hidden from the books. On 26 November the trader allegedly confessed to the political head of the department of finance, David Brenner, from the Social Democratic Party, that the portfolio had incurred a loss of €340 million. Two days later Brenner reported to the Land parliament's budgetary committee, but gave no hint about his department's efforts to establish the facts of the matter and to limit the potential losses from the trades. Brenner was eventually accused by the other parties, including its coalition partner the People's Party, of misleading the regional parliament.</p>
         
         <p>During early December confusion reigned. News reports alleged trading losses of several billion euros and the government's cameralistic system of accounting proved unable to come up with a quick and accurate status report. In a parliamentary session in mid‐December Brenner announced his resignation after the conclusion of the department's investigation into the matter. Social Democratic Land governor Gaby Burgstaller apologised in an emotional speech to the citizens for the impression created that the Land was facing a financial abyss. Her coalition partner – deputy Land governor and leader of the People's Party, Wilfried Haslauer – demanded new elections. A vote on parliament's dissolution was passed in January and a committee of investigation established. The regional elections in Salzburg are scheduled for May 2013.</p>

         <p>Parliament ratified the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in July. Voting was by roll call in both chambers. The government again needed support from the opposition for a two‐thirds majority, which was provided by the Greens. The Freedom Party and BZÖ strongly opposed ESM ratification. They had demanded a binding referendum vote on treaty ratification. Parliament was accorded additional information and approval rights. The latter will be exerted by a new standing sub‐committee of the budget committee for ESM issues.</p>
