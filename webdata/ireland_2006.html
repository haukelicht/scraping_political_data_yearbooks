</h2>
         
         <p>Though his government was widely expected to last the full five‐year term, the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern still managed to create some surprise in the termination of the 29th Dáil. Unlike in the previous election, where Fianna Fáil, the major governing party, controlled the whole campaign, in 2007 the very calling of the election on 29 April seemed ill‐prepared and rushed, leading many to wonder whether Ahern was afraid of what the Mahon Tribunal (investigating issues of planning for property developments and related payments to politicians) might reveal when evidence was due to be heard on Mr Ahern's finances the following day. (On the calling of the election, the tribunal suspended its sittings until after the election.)</p>
         
         <p>Though the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrat (PD) coalition had governed cohesively for nearly ten years (being re‐elected in 2002), issues around unexplained monies in bank accounts controlled by Mr Ahern and the unorthodox way in which he came to own his home had created tensions. The health service under the control of a PD minister was also the cause of some concern within the coalition in this election year. There was, in addition, some uncertainty about the robustness of the economy as, in the months up to the election, a number of high‐profile company closures led to job losses. Despite these problems, the economy was still growing and an electorally well‐timed policy to encourage savings was maturing, which meant financial windfalls for much of the electorate. The major historical problem in Ireland, the relationship between Nationalists and Unionists, was closer to being solved than at any time in history as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin prepared to enter government with each other. Ahern, as one of the key mediators in the agreement, was rewarded with the chance to speak to a joint sitting of the British Houses of Parliament in Westminster during the election campaign, allowing him to boost his image as a statesman.</p>
         
         <p>The election campaign was much more exciting and less predictable than the one five years earlier. Ahern's apparent lack of interest in the campaign – he was evasive and tetchy at the launch of his party's manifesto – and the poor opinion poll ratings for his party led some to question his own commitment to winning the election, which against an inexperienced and depleted opposition should have been his to lose. His finances re‐emerged as an issue during the campaign when Michael McDowell, the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) and leader of the PDs claimed to have been shown new information that contradicted Ahern's previous reassurances. McDowell bizarrely considered taking his party out of a government that had already ended, but was prevailed upon not to do so. The opposition parties did not engage in Ahern's finances as an issue, mainly because when they had done so nine months earlier, Fianna Fáil received a boost in the polls. Instead Fine Gael and Labour, which were campaigning as an alternative government, concentrated on public sector waste, the parlous state of the health services and the perception of rising levels of crime. The last two issues were under PD ministers' portfolios. In doing so, the alternative government effectively set the agenda for the early part of the campaign.</p>
         
         <p>In mid‐May, Fianna Fáil's deputy leader and Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen attempted to take control of the election by attacking the opposition parties' competence to run the economy. His attempt to shift the focus onto the economy from public services was helped by Ahern's ability to shift some focus from him to the other potential Taoiseach, Fine Gael leader, Enda Kenny. Though affable, Kenny had little ministerial experience and failed to put the Taoiseach under any pressure, whereas the more combative Ahern clearly won a television debate.</p>
         
         <p>Opinion polls reflected the shift in the focus of the campaign from public services to the economy and competence as Fianna Fáil gained significantly, and this was reflected in the eventual results. Fianna Fáil managed to avoid the significant drop in seats that had been widely predicted and in fact made a slight gain in its share of the vote. Though Fine Gael recovered much of what it had lost in its 2002 electoral disaster, it did so mainly at the expense of independents and other parties. Most of the smaller parties were unhappy with their results. Labour was stagnant, and Sinn Féin and the Greens failed to make the breakthrough each had predicted for themselves. The involvement of the Sinn Féin leader in the domestic politics of the Republic (Gerry Adams is from and based in Northern Ireland) showed him to be without an understanding and awareness of the issues. It was the PDs, however, a party that commentators had consistently written off before previous elections, which looked like it was finally wiped out. Though its drop in support was not large (just over one percentage point), it fell below a critical mass of support losing six of its eight seats including that of its leader. Though there were preparations for the selection of a new leader, it was difficult to see how the PDs could sustain themselves into the future. Independents, a common feature in Irish politics, also lost out in the squeeze on smaller political entities in what some regarded as a presidentialised election campaign.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Cabinet and party changes</h2>
         
         <p>In the aftermath of the election, when the arithmetic of potential new governments emerged, it became obvious that all realistic options included Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael would never have been willing to coalesce with Sinn Féin, who in turn would have balked at the possibility of belonging to a government dependent on PD support. Thus, Ahern, popular within his own party for having delivered it a third successive victory, was in a position to choose his coalition partners. He quickly indicated the type of government he wanted. Although a PD‐Fianna Fáil coalition with the support of some independents was possible, it would not have been stable and would have failed to introduce any sense of renewal or change. He eschewed Labour, who might have been easy to negotiate with (given the age profile of the parliamentary party, many in it would have realised it was their last chance at achieving office). Instead, Ahern chose to form an oversized majority coalition with support from the Green Party, the depleted PDs and four of the five independent TDs (MPs). Doing so was not easy as the Greens had been highly critical of Fianna Fáil and could expect some dissent from within the party. Indeed the party leader, Trevor Sargent, had pledged not to lead the party into government with Fianna Fáil. He was true to his word, and though supporting the party's negotiations with Fianna Fáil, resigned his leadership and refused to accept a cabinet position. The Greens' special party conference eventually overwhelmingly endorsed the programme for government that Fine Gael and Labour (perhaps in jealousy) claimed was a ‘cut and paste’ of the Fianna Fáil manifesto – a charge that was largely true. The Greens in turn claimed that they had successfully negotiated significant concessions. The oversized coalition also meant that the Greens lacked any blackmail potential – their threats to leave government need not cause a fall of the government, which could reduce their bargaining power.</p>
         
         <p>In constructing his third cabinet, Ahern was as cautious as he had been in the past. Only one new Fianna Fáil minister was appointed, and he had sat at cabinet in the previous government; nine ministers retained their existing portfolios. The PD minister, Mary Harney, stayed at Health and took over as acting leader of the party, though she indicated that she did not wish to retain the post for very long. The Greens chose their next most senior TD, John Gormley, and the young, articulate and telegenic energy spokesman, Éamon Ryan, to take their ministerial appointments. Gormley went on to become the leader of the party at an election by party members in July. He won with 65 per cent of the vote against a former MEP who was against going into government with Fianna Fáil. Ahern's conservatism in cabinet appointments caused some unrest in his backbenches as there was little sense that there were opportunities to progress within the party. Mainly to alleviate this, Ahern created three more junior ministerial positions, which, coupled with chairs and vice chairs of parliamentary committees, also in the gift of the Taoiseach, means that only two FF TDs do not have some other emolument.</p>
         
         <p>In media interviews after the formation of the government Ahern indicated that he would not contest the next general election, scheduled for 2012, as leader. He attempted to avert speculation on whom and when someone else might take over by naming his preferred successor, Brian Cowen. Cowen is very popular within the parliamentary party and was given the mainly symbolic role of Tánaiste. He is intensely loyal to Fianna Fáil and would have been seen as unlikely to try to remove Ahern. However, in the Autumn, the continued drip‐feeding of information on questionable lodgements by Ahern in the 1990s when he was Minister for Finance, and Ahern's failure to explain these convincingly either to the public, the Dáil or the Tribunal fuelled further speculation that Fianna Fáil would no longer consider Ahern an electoral asset and might remove him.</p>
         
         <p>The leadership of the Labour party became vacant when Pat Rabbitte stepped down following its disappointing election results. Only one candidate emerged, so Éamon Gilmore took over without an election by the party's membership. Gilmore was another former member of later Democratic Left (DL), a small radical left party that merged with Labour. He quickly indicated that he would not follow his predecessor's strategy of aligning itself to Fine Gael, a Christian democratic party. This seemed to indicate his willingness to coalesce with Fianna Fáil.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Most of the major issues in the national politics featured in the election campaign. The state of the health service led the media to cover the issue by highlighting many personal tragedies that illustrated the service's systemic problems. The opposition parties tried before and after the election to put pressure on the government with motions, including no‐confidence in the Minister for Health. The government maintained discipline, though there were reports of tensions within the government at what one Fianna Fáil back‐bencher saw as ‘confrontation, privatisation and Americanisation’ in health and other government policy.</p>
         
         <p>The decision of Aer Lingus, the part‐privatised ‘national’ airline, to end its flights from Shannon – an airport in the west of Ireland – to London Heathrow caused disquiet in the region as some claimed its ability to attract international firms to locate there would be hindered by the absence of a link to that international hub. The airline transferred its Heathrow landing slots from Shannon to a new Belfast route causing accusations that the privatisation had been botched and some wondered if there was anything to stop Aer Lingus selling all its slots.</p>
         
         <p>The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern's finances dominated national politics to the detriment, according to some ministers, of government. His Dáil performances were underwhelming and he looked increasingly preoccupied with his problems at the tribunal. Though ministers came out to support Ahern, most avoided saying that they believed his incredible and incoherent explanations. Rather they sought to wait for the outcome of the tribunal (which was expected to take years rather than months to report) before rushing to judgement. The government was not helped when it approved a massive pay increase for itself, making Ahern the most highly paid prime minister in Europe. His staunch defence of the pay rise and later decision to defer it showed a lapse in political judgement especially in the context of reduced exchequer returns and the likelihood of a slow down in public sector pay rises.</p>
         
         <p>The resumption of the Northern Ireland Executive would have been the biggest good news story in recent Irish history if it were not that it took so many false starts. However, the sight of Reverend Ian Paisley of the DUP and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin giggling together as they were elected First and Deputy First Minister, respectively, was something few could have predicted would ever happen. The two seemed to get on so well – being dubbed the ‘Chuckle Brothers’– that some in Paisley's party questioned his commitment to ‘traditional unionism’.</p>
