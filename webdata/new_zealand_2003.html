         <p>The cabinet year was dominated by two controversial resignations. In February, Minister of Immigration Lianne Dalziel was the first casualty. She did not act to prevent the deportation of a child originally from Sri Lanka who, it was alleged, was the victim of sexual abuse in her family. The child ended up in New Zealand in the care of a relative seeking to remove her from the situation, but this did not meet the normal criteria for refugee status. Under considerable pressure from a legal campaign mounted on behalf of the child, Dalziel was reported as denying knowledge about how a fax containing information on the matter sent to the Prime Minister's electorate office was released to the media. She later admitted that she had released the fax, and offered her resignation from Cabinet.</p>
         
         <p>In the second case, junior Minister John Tamihere sought leave to stand down after allegations of financial impropriety at his previous employment at a Maori Trust organisation. He resigned after the allegations were referred to the Serious Fraud Office, before any investigations had been concluded. In the context of these allegations, a serious political problem was also revealed. He had taken a substantial payout after the end of that employment, despite earlier declaring he would not. Labour, in opposition, had made much of criticising excessive public‐sector payouts to departing employees under the previous National government, and promised to bring them under control. Tamihere had accepted the payout against the spirit of party policy, against his earlier commitment not to, and failed to reveal it to the Prime Minister. Subsequently, he was cleared on the allegations of impropriety, but was not reinstated to cabinet.</p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, senior Minister Trevor Mallard took on a new position as Coordinating Minister for Race Relations. This was a political response to Opposition Leader Don Brash's strong attack on the government's race relations policies, particularly on Maori matters, and a very major shift in the polls towards the opposition at the beginning of the year.</p>
         
         <p>Dalziel's resignation led to a minor reallocation of portfolios and the appointment of a new minister, David Benson‐Pope. Politically, his selection was seen as maintaining the strength of the ‘left’ faction in the cabinet, the group providing the strongest support for the Prime Minister, and with which Dalziel had also been identified. Expectations that promotion might go to a more socially conservative member of the ‘right’ faction were dashed. However, Benson‐Pope's abilities in his former role as Senior Whip provided a strong case for his appointment.</p>
         
         <p>Tamihere's resignation initially led to temporary reallocations of portfolios, and a new appointment did not follow, bringing the size of the cabinet down from 20 to 19. Just before the end of the year, the Prime Minister reallocated responsibilities on a more permanent basis, with Tamihere's portfolios moving to senior ministers Pete Hodgson and Steve Maharey. Margaret Wilson also stepped down as Minister of Commerce, with that portfolio also going to Hodgson. This was to prepare the way for her stepping down from the cabinet to take up the job of Speaker at the end of February. However, at year's end, Wilson remained in the cabinet with her duties of Attorney‐General and Waitangi Treaty Negotiations.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>For a year without a general election, 2004 was an eventful one in New Zealand politics. In January, National Party Opposition Leader Don Brash delivered a hard‐hitting speech on race relations. He did so in Orewa, a beachside community north of Auckland where former National Party Leader Robert Muldoon had made similar annual ‘state of the nation’ speeches in his heyday. Brash claimed current policies were creating a ‘racially divided nation, with two sets of laws, and two standards of citizenship’. In the aftermath of the government's announcement of policies to confirm public ownership of the foreshore and seabed against potential Maori claims, the speech struck a chord. Yet the final catalyst for a major shift in public opinion came on Waitangi Day, 6 February, when celebrations of the signing of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, were once more disrupted by protests from a minority of radical Maori. Television news programmes showing mud being thrown at Brash at Waitangi, coupled with further discourtesy shown toward the Prime Minister, fed the momentum. Polling later in the month saw National Party support up 17 points to 45 per cent, the biggest one‐month poll movement ever recorded in New Zealand, and leapfrogging support for the governing Labour Party that had hitherto held a commanding lead.</p>
         
         <p>The government's response was quick. A senior minister, Trevor Mallard, not a Maori, was appointed to coordinate race relations policies. The government appeared to concede that there were too many ethnically targeted policies favouring Maori. Details of legislation to confirm public ownership of the foreshore and seabed continued to be contentious, particularly within the Labour Party, and among its Maori MPs. The law charged the New Zealand government with protecting public ownership of the foreshore and seabed in perpetuity. Maori with strong claims can apply to become guardians of some areas, possibly including the exercise of customary rights, some concession to their potential claims, but many Maori reasonably viewed this legislation as appropriating a potential common law freehold property right on racial grounds and thus confirming continued discriminatory policy. On grounds of principle, Maori had some support from economic liberals in the Business Roundtable and the ACT party.</p>
         
         <p>On 17 May, Minister outside Cabinet Tariana Turia resigned from Parliament, left the Labour Party and the government, and took a central role in the formation of a new Maori Party. This brought Labour's Parliamentary representation down to 51 seats. She stood as an Independent in a by‐election, with a Maori Party already forming around her. The official formation of the Maori Party was announced on polling day. Seeking to minimise the fallout and reduce the incentives for the Maori Party to build an organisation, Labour chose not to stand against her. On 10 July, Turia was elected with an overwhelming majority. Over the last half‐century, Labour had lost the Maori vote heavily only once, in 1996. There were indications that Labour was likely to lose a large amount of it again. Meanwhile, the National Party and Don Brash failed to follow up the Orewa speech with any specific policies to bring an end to the racial divisions criticised. Coupled with the creation of the Maori Party, the passage of the foreshore and seabed legislation, and increasing Maori Party criticism of Labour, this helped to distance the government from appearing to favour ‘race‐based’ policies.</p>
         
         <p>The government was moving on other fronts, many equally controversial. Employment law was amended to give trade unions more legal support and facilitate national bargaining. Smoking was banned in bars and restaurants. Legislation establishing the right of same‐sex couples to form civil unions that shared most of the legal rights associated with marriage was contested strongly by social conservatives. The law passed on a conscience vote of Parliament, most support coming from the members of the centre‐left parties. Strong opposition was mounted by the Destiny Church, a new fundamentalist religious organisation with a charismatic leader, with an associated political party. While the Destiny Church was able to mount large street demonstrations that were intimidating to many observers, they gained no traction in the polls and their intervention seemed most likely to further fracture an already fragmented conservative Christian vote. The government also legislated to increase annual holiday entitlements from three to four weeks, to take effect after the next election. The opposition National Party argued against the change, but by the end of the year had conceded that it would be irreversible. National also announced that it would no longer oppose Labour's public superannuation fund, possibly bringing to an end decades of acrimony between the two major parties on the funding of public pensions.</p>
         
         <p>The 2004 local government elections were unremarkable except in the country's largest city, Auckland, where centre‐left candidates took control of the City Council and the Auckland Regional Council, the most comprehensive local victories for the left in the city's history. A rejection of the policies of the previous conservative mayor and councils, this change of local leadership was likely to increase investment in the development of public transport and infrastructure, both hitherto neglected despite substantial growth throughout the Auckland region.</p>
         
         <p>The status of the new Supreme Court also provoked debate. Members of the government expressed concern that it should not encroach upon parliamentary sovereignty. Meanwhile, the court's members complained of resource constraints they felt reduced its autonomy. Two of the court's earliest decisions were politically significant. It found that the exclusion of former ACT MP Donna Awatere from her party had distorted the proportionality of Parliament, thus forcing her removal from the House under the Electoral Integrity Act, passed to prevent ‘party‐hopping’. Even more significantly, in December, the court ruled that Algerian refugee Ahmed Zaoui should be released on bail. Zaoui had been held in prison on security grounds since his arrival in New Zealand. In March, Security Intelligence Inspector‐General Laurie Grieg was forced to resign after the Court of Appeal found that he had shown bias against Zaoui in a magazine interview the previous year. In July, the High Court ruled that human rights considerations should be applied to the case, although by the year's end the government's appeal against the decision had not yet been heard.</p>
         
         <p>Another set of issues on which the government was vulnerable concerned the police. Accusations of a gang rape by a group of police officers some years earlier led to investigations that indicated that there was a case to answer. The Employment Court ruled that a former Police Superintendent had been wrongly dismissed, and there were increasing complaints about mistakes in police receipt of emergency calls, and the reactions applied to these, following the change to a more centralised system. The late 1980s merger of traffic law enforcement with the police remained an ongoing source of irritation to the public, many people perceiving the police enforcing trivial traffic laws to raise revenue while neglecting the investigation of crime. Minister of Police George Hawkins was the object of sustained parliamentary attack through the year. Not one of the strongest or most articulate members of the Cabinet, he withstood the attacks with stoicism and dignity, but could not always convincingly repel them.</p>
         
         <p>Despite one of its most difficult years since gaining office in 1999, the government ended the year in a strong position. Political commentators observed that National's attack on race relations had ‘run out of puff’. National remained more competitive in the polls than at any time since the 2002 election, but Labour's lead looked convincing again by December. Prime Minister Helen Clark had also regained her commanding position as preferred Prime Minister. The government's success owed much to the competence of its senior ministers, the unity of the Labour Party, and the confident and able leadership of the Prime Minister. It was also underpinned by the continued strength of the New Zealand economy, more resilient than expected in the context of substantial appreciation of the New Zealand dollar. During the 2004 calendar year, unemployment fell from 4.3 to 3.6 per cent of the labour force and economic growth was 4.8 per cent, both excellent performances relative to other OECD countries. Housing and share markets were buoyant, and retail spending high. The government's continued public support owed much to a ‘feel‐good factor’. At the end of 2004, observers were already anticipating developments in the economy that might take the gloss off such public sentiments, and, with an election due in 2005, another eventful year lay ahead for New Zealand politics.</p>
