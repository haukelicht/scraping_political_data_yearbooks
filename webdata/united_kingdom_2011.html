         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12034-sec-0002-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Politics in the United Kingdom in 2012 saw tensions between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition partners exacerbated with major differences over Lords reform. Disagreements over the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union and different responses to the Leveson Report on press behaviour also contributed to the strains between the two parties of government. In May, there were elections to local government, the London Mayor and London Assembly, two mayoral contests and several referenda on whether to introduce directly elected mayors. Politics were somewhat quiet over the summer when London hosted the Olympic Games. Following this, Cameron engaged in his first reshuffle of the cabinet in September. November saw the first Police and Crime Commissioner elections, at which the turnout was 15 per cent, on average – the lowest ever recorded at a national election (Berman et al. <span><a href="#epdy12034-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12034-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>There were seven by‐elections, in two of which the UK Independence Party (UKIP) finished second. UKIP saw a considerable rise in support in the polls in April and May from somewhere between 4 and 6 per cent up to 8–9 per cent, and a further jump in November up to roughly 10 per cent. The Liberal Democrats suffered a significant blow when a senior figure, Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne, resigned as part of a complicated saga of marital dissolution and minor legal infractions that continued into 2013. In September 2012, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg publicly apologised for his party's decision to support a rise in university tuition fees contrary to promises made in its 2010 election manifesto. His broadcast was quickly satirised in a YouTube clip which set his apology to music. A month later, Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell resigned amid allegations that he had sworn at a police officer and referred to him as a ‘pleb’. The year came to an end with Labour roughly ten points ahead of the Conservatives in the polls, the two parties having begun 2012 almost neck and neck. Liberal Democrat support was somewhere between 7 and 10 per cent with UKIP in a similar bracket but with a slightly higher upper limit (United Kingdom Polling Report).</p>
         
         <p>The poor state of economic growth continued in 2012 with the economy contracting for the second consecutive quarter during January to March, indicating a double‐dip recession. In February, credit ratings agency Moody's correspondingly changed their view of the United Kingdom's status to ‘negative outlook’, indicating that Britain might lose its AAA credit rating at some point in the future – an outcome that actually did occur in early 2013. Decline continued in the second quarter of 2012 and while there was slight growth in the third quarter, the economy contracted again in the last three months of the year. More positive for the government were figures on unemployment, which fell in every quarter.</p>
         
         <p>In other economy‐related developments, the 2012 budget and its aftermath did little to increase the reputation of the government. A series of decisions made in the budget were reversed following opposition from MPs and the public. These included the so‐called ‘pasty tax’ – a 20 per cent levy on purchases of hot take‐away food. A decision to limit tax relief on charitable giving saw much opposition from charities predicting a decline in donations. This too was scrapped. While it was not reversed, the ‘granny tax’, which prevents new pensioners from receiving an increase in their personal tax‐free allowance and freezes this allowance for existing pensions, faced similarly negative publicity. These events likely contributed to a fall in support for the Conservatives in opinion polls following what became labelled the ‘omnishambles’ budget. The media reported heated conversations between the Conservative Chancellor George Osborne and Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in the days following the budget.</p>
         
         <p>Differences between the two parties of government were evident in other policy areas during the year. Among these, the division over reform of the House of Lords stands out. This issue has long been on the political agenda and featured in all the major parties' 2010 election manifestos in various forms. However, it remains of low salience among voters. Announcing its legislative programme in May, the government included plans for reforming the upper house with the aim of making it predominantly elected. Some Conservatives were opposed on the grounds that measures to deal with the nation's economic problems should have taken precedence over constitutional changes about which the Liberal Democrats appeared much more concerned. By July, when MPs were due to vote on a motion establishing the timetable for this bill, 70 Conservative MPs had signed a letter opposing the suggestions for reform. With the high likelihood of the motion being defeated, the government chose to postpone it. Such was the lack of Conservative backbench support that by early August Nick Clegg announced that the government had abandoned its plans for Lords reform. The relevant bill had passed its second reading in the Commons in July, but this was despite the largest rebellion to have occurred under the coalition with 91 Conservative MPs voting against the government. Clegg argued that part of the coalition contract had been broken through the failure of the Conservative leadership to deliver their party's support for these plans. In retaliation, Liberal Democrats were instructed to oppose legislation revising constituency boundaries as part of the government's plan to cut the number of MPs to 600 following the next general election. These boundary changes were expected to benefit the Conservatives electorally by reducing disparities in constituency size (Johnston et al. <span><a href="#epdy12034-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12034-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>). The Liberal Democrats' response opened up the possibility of members of the government being instructed to vote against government policy, rather stretching the notion of collective responsibility normally ascribed to British cabinets.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Leveson Inquiry into the media and phone‐hacking that began in 2011 (see Whitaker (<span><a href="#epdy12034-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12034-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>) for more details) was completed during 2012, with the prime minister and former holders of this office – John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown – among others, giving evidence. Two issues related to Leveson caused substantial problems for the coalition. The first was the appearance in front of the inquiry of Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt who had taken charge of dealing with News Corporation's bid to buy the proportion of broadcaster BSkyB that it did not already own. E‐mails published by the inquiry seemed to suggest that Hunt was in very close contact with News Corporation's public affairs director, compromising Hunt's ability to deal with the issue independently. Despite calls for his resignation, he survived on the basis that much of News Corporation's contact with the government had actually been via one of his special advisors, who later claimed he was acting without Hunt's permission and resigned from his position. Second, after Leveson published his recommendations in November 2012, Cameron opposed the suggestion in the report that regulation of the press should have a basis in legislation, arguing that this might have the potential to infringe free speech. Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband supported Leveson on this, providing evidence of further divisions between the coalition partners.
         </p>
         
         <p>Elections were held on 3 May to local authorities. Labour performed best, winning or retaining control of 75 councils, with net gains of 32 councils and 832 councillors. The Conservatives made net losses of 12 councils, winning or retaining control of 42 in total and making a net loss of 403 councillors. As in 2011, the Liberal Democrats experienced poor results, losing around half of their councillors in Wales and Scotland with net losses in Britain overall of 333 councillors and one council (McGuinness &amp; Tetteh <span><a href="#epdy12034-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12034-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>), leaving them with the lowest number of councillors in the party's history. UKIP averaged about 13 per cent in the seats they contested, representing a considerable increase on 2011, but which was translated into a net gain of only one councillor. On the same day, mayoral elections were held for the first time in Liverpool and Salford, with Labour winning both. Referendums were held in ten cities on whether to establish an elected mayor, with only Bristol voting in favour of the change. Voters in Doncaster opted to retain their elected mayor in a referendum. In the contest for London Mayor, the Conservative incumbent Boris Johnson won a second term and secured 44 per cent of first preference votes compared to 40 per cent for Labour's Ken Livingstone. Labour became the largest party in the London Assembly with 12 of the 25 seats, while the Conservatives lost two and the Liberal Democrats were down one. The British National Party lost the one member of the Assembly it had, while the Green Party retained its two seats. UKIP has often performed less well in London than in some other areas and it failed to win any seats in the Assembly despite an increased vote share. The party's mayoral candidate finished sixth (McGuinness <span><a href="#epdy12034-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12034-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>While local elections were discussed as a measure of parties' standing with the electorate, the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in November had a far lower profile. These contests were originally supposed to have taken place at the same time as the local elections in May, which might have led to a higher turnout. They were delayed as part of a compromise achieved in the House of Lords where Liberal Democrats had opposed elements of the relevant legislation. Holders of the new elected office take on very similar functions to those of former police authorities. They set budgets and local policing priorities and can appoint chief constables. Commissioners were elected under the supplementary vote system in each of the 41 police areas in England and Wales outside of London where a different system operates. If the delay from May to November was partly to give voters a better chance to understand this new office and the candidates for it, this appears to have been largely unsuccessful. As noted earlier, turnout was at a record low. Of the 41 commissioners, the Conservatives secured 16, Labour 13 and independents 12. The low turnout meant it was difficult to assess the political significance of these results for the parties. Research for the Electoral Commission (<span><a href="#epdy12034-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12034-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>) suggested that 28 per cent of people knew nothing at all of what the elections were about, with 37 per cent of those not voting claiming not to have taken part due to lack of awareness – a proportion much greater than the 7 per cent of non‐voters who gave the same reason for not participating in the local elections in May. Raising awareness of the elections was perhaps made more difficult by the decision not to allow candidates a free mailshot. Instead of election leaflets landing on voters' door mats, electors had to go to a website on which candidates could set out information about themselves and their proposals. Clearly there is much to be done if participation rates are to be higher at the next set of these elections, due in May 2016.

         <p>One political theme that came up at several points during the year was the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union. While this caused friction between the coalition parties, it was also indicative of differences within the Conservative Party about the need for and timing of a referendum on membership of the EU. Early March saw the signing by all EU Member States, except the United Kingdom and Czech Republic, of the fiscal compact treaty – a version of which Cameron had vetoed at the end of 2011. While Cameron's decision not to sign went down well with some eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers, he was criticised for having dropped his insistence that EU institutions should not be used for implementing the treaty. Nevertheless, he maintained that the United Kingdom might challenge this if its interests were threatened. As the year went on, pressure mounted on the prime minister to commit to a referendum on EU membership. Over 90 Conservative MPs signed a letter in June, on the eve of a European Council meeting, calling for a referendum in the next parliament on the United Kingdom's relationship with the EU. Cameron responded with a piece in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> on 30 June in which he agreed with the principle of a referendum, but suggested it needed to happen sometime in the future when the government was able to offer voters a choice between perhaps a revised relationship with the EU, on the one hand, and exit, on the other. Days later, former cabinet minister Liam Fox applied further pressure in a speech to the Taxpayers' Alliance, suggesting the United Kingdom should renegotiate its terms of EU membership and that it should leave if a better deal proved impossible to achieve – a point that Cameron had not addressed directly. Some eurosceptics in the party were pleased by Home Secretary Theresa May's announcement in October that the government planned to opt out of crime and policing legislation at the EU level agreed prior to the Lisbon Treaty. The agreement also means that the United Kingdom could later choose to opt in to particular measures, the details of which divided the coalition partners. In particular, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats disagreed over the European Arrest Warrant, the Liberal Democrats having supported this in their 2010 election manifesto. Discussion within the Conservatives about the EU issue rumbled on though, particularly in the light of UKIP's success in by‐elections in November. Evidence of how seriously some in the party were taking UKIP's rise came via a memorandum written by Conservative Party vice‐chair Michael Fabricant, which called for a Conservative‐UKIP pact at the next general election.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Scottish developments, the year began with debates about when a referendum on Scottish independence should be held and what the question(s) should cover. Cameron favoured a referendum within 18 months. He wanted to see only one question about whether Scotland should become independent and opposed giving voters a further option of transferring more powers to Scotland while maintaining the union. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond insisted his party, having won a majority in the Scottish parliament in 2011, had a mandate to introduce a referendum without interference from Westminster. He favoured a date in autumn 2014, allowing more time to make the arguments in favour of Scotland's secession from the United Kingdom. By October, the two leaders had reached an agreement that the referendum must be held by the end of 2014 and that it would include only one question covering Scottish independence. Powers would be granted to the Scottish executive and parliament to hold the referendum. Campaigns on both sides of the debate began during the year. ‘Yes Scotland’, favouring independence, was launched in late May, while ‘Better Together’, the campaign in favour of keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom, began life in June. The year 2012 also saw the passage of the Scotland Act, which implemented recommendations of the Calman Commission including devolving powers over drink driving and speed limits among other things. More significantly, subject to a ‘no’ vote in the independence referendum, it will transfer much greater powers to set income tax in Scotland in an attempt to improve the accountability of the Scottish executive for tax rates and levels of public spending.</p>
         
         <p>The Silk Commission on Devolution in Wales published its first report in November on financial arrangements. It called for the Welsh government to have powers to vary income tax levels by 2020.</p>
         
         <p>In Northern Ireland, a prison officer was shot dead in his car on the way to work in November. This was the first killing of a prison officer in Northern Ireland for 20 years. The attack, which was reported to have been carried out by dissident republicans, was condemned by the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister (Gay <span><a href="#epdy12034-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12034-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>).

         <p>There were seven by‐elections during 2012. The first, in Bradford West on 29 March, saw George Galloway of the Respect Party winning against expectations in a seat that had been held by Labour since 1974. The election was caused by the resignation of the incumbent due to ill health. Three by‐elections occurred on 15 November – all due to the resignation of incumbents. All were won by Labour; two (Cardiff South and Penarth, and Manchester Central) were holds and one (Corby) was a gain from the Conservatives. Three more by‐elections took place on 29 November – all of which Labour held. Two were caused by the death of incumbents (Croydon North and Middlesbrough) and one by a resignation (Rotherham).</p>
