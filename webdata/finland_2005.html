         <p>The results from the first round in the presidential election gave no candidate over 50 per cent of the votes – the threshold for winning the election. If candidates win less than 50 per cent of the votes, a second round is needed. In total, eight candidates were nominated. The incumbent, Tarja Halonen, was nominated by the Social Democrats and supported by the Left‐wing Alliance. Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was nominated by the Centre Party, and former Minister of Finance Sauli Niinistö by the National Coalition. In addition, five more candidates were nominated by small parties, and one of them from a non‐political list. Two of the candidates were women. The turnout was 70.8 per cent, which is lower than in the two earlier presidential elections. Female voters have participated more than men in parliamentary elections since 1991. This election was no exception. However, the gap was bigger than ever before, as 77.5 per cent of women voted compared to 70 per cent of men. This unprecedented gender gap cannot be ignored in electoral studies.</p>
         
         <p>The results from the first round gave President Tarja Halonen 46.3 per cent of the votes. Before the campaign began, Halonen led the polls and suggested she might win the election in the first round. However, as election day came closer, her advantage narrowed, while Sauli Niinistö's support exceeded Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen in the polls. Nevertheless, Halonen won the first round be a wide marginal, leaving Niinistö trailing. More importantly, the sitting Prime Minister (even though his campaign budget exceeded Sauli Niinisö's and Tarja Halonen's) did not manage to make it into to the second round, which was seen as a failure for him and his party. All the other candidates had only marginal importance in the election, and their campaign budgets were much smaller.</p>
         
         <p>The second round took place two weeks after the first. Now the situation was different with just two candidates – one from the socialist bloc and one from the non‐socialist bloc – facing off. The dominance of the non‐socialist bloc in Parliament is overwhelming, but bloc politics does not work well in presidential elections. Tarja Halonen softened her appeal in the campaign, running as an experienced President for all Finnish citizens. Sauli Niinistö, on the other hand, talked about being the President of all working people. The Centre Party supported his campaign, indicating a close race. As a result, turnout increased to 74 per cent, up 3.2 percentage points on the first round. As in the first round, female voters were considerably more active than men, although the gap in favour of women was now 6.1 per cent, which was slightly less than in the first round; this time 80.2 per cent of the women resident in Finland voted and only 74.1 per cent of the men. The election result gave Tarja Halonen a second term as President of Finland. She beat Sauli Niinistö by 3.6 percentage points. Gender seems to have been less important in this election than in the previous presidential contest in 2000, although young women and older men tended more strongly than others to vote for their own gender. Once again, however, it would appear that party loyalty is not as big a factor in presidential elections as it is in the party contest; votes float more easily over bloc barriers, laying more stress on the individual qualities of the candidates.</p>

         <p>The main issue during the year 2006 was Finland's six month Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU), which came to an end on 31 December. The central focus was on enlargement, energy policy, the strengthening of competitiveness, combating climate change, immigration, the Middle East and cooperation between the EU and Russia. Two broad‐based pieces of legislation were approved during the Finnish Presidency, after years of negotiation. The REACH Regulation is an overhaul of EU chemicals legislation. Its purpose is to improve health and environmental protection standards, and at the same time safeguard the competitiveness of the EU's chemicals industry. The Services Directive constitutes an advance in the development of the internal market in services. Finland also sought a consensus for amending the Working Time Directive, but regrettably no agreement could be reached.</p>
         
         <p>Finland also took the initiative in inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin to an informal meeting of EU heads of state or government in October. Initially, this was seen as a clever move since energy issues had moved high up Europe's political agenda. However, Putin used the summit as a platform for attacking Georgia and for criticising the EU for not signing an energy pact that would secure better access to his country's gas and oil fields. Much attention was given to Putin's defence of his government in its handling of the investigation of the murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya. After the summit, the EU's relations with Russia deteriorated when Poland vetoed a treaty between both sides. Russia threatened to ban all EU meat imports after Bulgaria and Romania joined the Union on 1 January.</p>
