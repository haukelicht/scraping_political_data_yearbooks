         <p>On 16 January, the Minister of Justice Clemente Mastella, leader of the tiny moderate confessional party Udeur, resigned – apparently because his wife (chairperson of the Campania regional council) was arrested for bribery, but in reality because he perceived that his political future would be better served by abandoning the centre‐left coalition and joining the opposition. Prime Minister Romano Prodi replaced him as Minister of Justice in the interim. Within days, however, Prodi realised that his very slim majority was waning away and asked for a vote of confidence in the two chambers. The Chamber of Deputies approved, but the Senate voted against 161 to 156. After AN attempt to form a ‘transition government’ led by the Chair of the Senate, the chambers were dissolved on 6 February and new elections called for 13 and 14 April (Italy is one of the few countries where voting takes place over two consecutive days).</p>
         
         <p>The two major competitors were quite different compared to the previous election in 2006, where there were two coalitions of parties that competed in order to gain, according to the electoral law, the bonus of 55 per cent of the seats allotted to the most popular coalition. These were the centre‐left coalition led by the former prime minister and president of the EU Commission, Romano Prodi, and the centre‐right coalition led by Forza Italia‐FI (Go Italy) leader Silvio Berlusconi. In 2008, instead of fronting coalitions, the major parties of the two poles competed alone. This decision had a dramatic effect on the configuration of the party system. The first move towards ‘competing alone’ rather than in a coalition was the newly founded Partito Democratico (Democratic Party). The PD, founded at the end of 2007 by merging the socialist DS and the catholic Daisy (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ignazi 2008</a></span>), aimed to represent a larger share of the electorate – one well beyond the reach of the two founding parties. For this reason it wanted to disband the large and contentious coalition l'Unione (the Union), which had won by a narrow margin in 2006 and whose continuous internal quarrels were undermining (and did undermine) Prodi's Government. This new project, launched under the slogan of building a ‘party with a majority vocation’, capable of achieving an unprecedented share of the vote for a centre‐left party and of attracting new constituencies thanks to its renewal, needed some time to bed in. However, the sudden collapse of the Prodi Government in February meant that it was not yet ready to act with any credibility as a large, reformist party.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Democrats' decision to compete alone and not to replicate the former centre‐left coalition forced the minor parties to present their own lists; this implied that they had to overcome the 4 per cent threshold in order to gain parliamentary representation – a share that in the event eluded the radical left parties. The only party beyond the PD that survived was the Italia dei Valori (IdV, Italy of Values) – a sort of protest party led by the former, very popular, ‘Clean Hands’ prosecutor, Antonio di Pietro.</p>
         
         <p>On the other side of the spectrum the centre‐right followed the same course. By the end of 2007 the FI leader Silvio Berlusconi had launched the idea of a new party. He was met by an initial refusal on the part of Alleanza Nazionale (AN, National Alliance) but later on, when the new elections were called, the two parties agreed to present themselves at the elections under a new umbrella: Popolo della Libertà (PDL, People of Freedom). In contrast to the 2006 election, two parties of the former centre‐right coalition, the regionalist‐xenophobic Lega Nord (LN, Northern League) and the moderate catholic Unione Democratica di Centro (UDC, Centre Democratic Union), did not join the PDL, albeit for different reasons. The LN preferred to compete alone in order to maintain its regional specificity, even though it declared its loyalty to the PDL; on the other hand, the UDC broke any ties with the former allies and took an autonomous position as a moderate‐centrist party in between the two opposing camps.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Outcome and aftermath of the elections</h2>
         
         <p>For once the elections had clear winners and losers as well as providing a new party system with only six parties represented in parliament (counting AN and FI separately, even though they created a joint parliamentary group under the PDL banner). The results left the newly formed PD in a state of shock. A further blow, the fortnight after the general elections, came in the shape of the defeat of the PD candidate, Francesco Rutelli, in the election for the mayor of Rome at the hands of the young AN leader Gianni Alemanno. The party leader Walter Veltroni was personally hit by the result since he had resigned from the mayoralty to take the leadership of the PD. The party leaders' reactions to the electoral results were quite different. Whereas he underlined the fact that the 33.2 per cent represented the highest percentage ever collected by a single centre‐left party, other leaders stressed the defeat inflicted by its centre‐right competitor, the PDL (which scored 37.4 per cent) and by the right‐wing front as a whole. These different interpretations of the result tore the party apart. Incessant struggle afflicted the PD over the following months, depressing its activists and enfeebling its leadership. Even though a party rally called in Rome on 25 October gathered more than one million people, it did not reverse the negative trend, nor smooth over the internal quarrels.</p>
         
         <p>The PD crisis profited its ally, the relatively vocal IdV, allowing the latter to voice the most intransigent opposition to the government. Such a hard line was rewarded in the opinion polls by many former PD voters displeased by Veltroni's party's naval gazing and lack of initiative. Meanwhile, the radical left, finally, brutally and unexpectedly defeated at the elections, seemed incapable of recovering itself and slid into sectarianism and irrelevance. Rifondazione Comunista (RC, Communist Refoundation) split, and the Greens were reduced to a ‘<i>groupuscolaire</i>’ status.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the other side of the political spectrum, FI and AN decided to pursue unification of the two parties. Slowly but surely they moved toward merger. Prime Minister Berlusconi was unquestionably and unanimously the designated leader of the future party; the AN leader Gianfranco Fini , would‐be competitor of Mr Berlusconi, preferred to avoid partisan debates and accepted the institutional role of Chair of the Chamber of Deputies, from where he began a subtle but perceptible attempt to distance himself from the prime minister. His move towards a more centrist and moderate location, often displacing his own former AN followers, represents the most novel development inside the centre‐right.</p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, the Lega Nord was cheered by everybody for its electoral performance, even if it did not reach its 1996 high. The party was rewarded for its tough position against immigrants and for invoking harder law and order provisions, which will undoubtedly push the Berlusconi Government further in this direction. The UDC, a moderate Catholic party formerly allied to the other centre‐right parties, took the risk of competing alone at the general elections. It succeeded in overcoming the threshold and located itself between the two fonts. However, unless it is strengthened by an eventual split of the PD's moderate confessional wing (which is increasingly uneasy inside that party), UDC might need to reconsider its strategy if it is to avoid being squeezed by the major parties.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Political events</h2>
         
         <p>Oddly enough, a central political issue of the year was represented by rubbish. At the very beginning of the year the amount of uncollected waste in the streets of Naples had reached unparalleled dimensions. The garbage in Naples' streets has always represented a nightmare for each city administration. However, owing to a series of circumstances – protest against waste disposal sites, a delay in the completion of incinerators, bad timing in the process of collection, deposit and disposal, the involvement of the criminal organisation Camorra – by the turn of the year, rubbish had begun piling up in streets and squares. All the attempts by the Prodi Government, and even the appointment of the highly prestigious former head of the anti‐Mafia department and of the national police, Giovanni De Gennaro, as ad hoc commissioner, failed. The protest inflamed the surrounding areas and blocked any initiative. Since the mayor of Naples was a prominent centre‐left personality, this question was abundantly exploited by the centre‐right opposition during the electoral campaign; and after the election the new Berlusconi Government put a particular emphasis on solving the problem. In some ways it succeeded in a relatively short span of time. This success was trumped by the government (and seconded by most of the media) as proof of its efficacy and eagerness.</p>
         
         <p>A second long‐lasting question that the Prodi Government did not solve before its fall concerned the fate of the state‐owned air company Alitalia. The centre‐left government had initiated a process for its privatisation, while Air France had expressed an interest in buying the company, with negotiations starting by the end of 2007. The centre‐right opposition criticised this option and clearly stated that if it won the upcoming election it would reconsider the deal. The weakness of the Prodi Government (by the end little more than a caretaker administration), the protest of the (numerous and corporatist) trade unions and the negative signals sent out by the probable winner of the imminent elections convinced Air France to pull out. The alternative offered by the opposition and particularly by Mr Berlusconi himself, was the ‘national solution’– the acquisition of Alitalia by a group of Italian investors. By the end of the year, Alitalia, by then heavily subsidised by the state, was sold to a newly established ‘Italian’ company, composed of banks and private entrepreneurs (directly and personally solicited by Prime Minister Berlusconi himself). This outcome was highly criticised – both because of the much higher burden it imposed on taxpayers in comparison to the Air France proposal and because of the job losses involved. However, both the national business community and the public at large appreciated the move since it represented a ‘gift’ to the former and flattered the nationalist sentiment of the latter.</p>
         
         <p>The well known dyad of immigration and security occupied a large place on the political stage during the year. The centre‐right, and the Lega Nord in particular, campaigned on this issue, linking the two phenomena. Some quite dramatic events – especially rapes and murders perpetrated by AN immigrants – put the issue in the spotlight. The Roma community was particularly targeted concerning (and actually often involved in) criminal activities and violence against women. After the election, the new government, under the influence of the Lega Nord and the Minister of Interior, introduced a series of ‘law and order’ measures, including the documenting of all Roma people and their forced relocation in far away camps. This provision was condemned by the European Parliament, the EU's Human Rights Commissioner and other international agencies. The government was thus forced to modify it. However, this setback occurred beneath the radar, whereas the apparently hardline policy against immigrants and crime – which also saw 3,000 troops patrolling the main cities (at the same time as the government cut police resources) – impressed public opinion, even those beyond the reach of the centre‐right. Other, more divisive, proposals by the centre‐right came close to overt xenophobia and islamophobia. For example, some Lega Nord leaders argued in favour of school segregation for foreign and native pupils – and even for segregated public transport.</p>
         
         <p>The most visible opposition to the government was provided by students and professors from elementary schools all the way up to universities. The cut in the resources for the public schools – at the same time as funding for private (overwhelmingly Roman Catholic) schools was increased – stimulated various protests in the second half of the year. The protest movement, called ‘the Wave’, actually succeeded in mitigating some of the most swinging cuts, especially those affecting universities.</p>
         
         <p>A very divisive and contested law passed by the government was the so‐called ‘lodo Alfano’, which granted immunity to four institutional positions: President of the Republic, Prime Minister, Chairs of the Chamber and of the Senate. This bill was meant basically to protect Silvio Berlusconi, both then and in the future.</p>
