         <p>As tradition requires, the local (<i>kommune</i>) and provincial (<i>fylke</i>) elections were held on 15 September 2003, two years after the last national election. Although these elections have no formal influence on national‐level politics, they are regarded as an important ‘midterm test’ for the Government and the opposition. Two parties from the opposition were declared winners of the 2003 elections: the right‐wing Progress Party and the left‐wing Socialist Left Party. Both parties achieved their best‐ever local election results with respectively 16.4 and 12.4 per cent of the votes. Traditionally the Progress Party has played a rather insignificant role in Norwegian local politics, but with the 2003 elections that changed (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Bjørklund &amp; Saglie 2004</a></span>: 2). In 30 municipalities (of 434) the party gained more votes than any other party, and they succeeded in seizing the position of mayor in 13 of them.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The Progress Party's electoral success was probably linked with the fact that the party has a high profile on three out of the five issues topping the electorates’ agenda. Due to a controversial report that revealed appalling conditions for the elderly in social institutions, ‘care for the elderly’ became the second most important issue in the election campaign. Previously this had been an issue associated with Labour, but over the years the Progress Party seem to have taken over the issue's ownership (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aardal 2002</a></span>). The focus on taxes and immigration also helped the Progress Party, and particularly the latter is one of their well‐established core issues. Although most of the other parties normally fear and try to avoid making immigration an important topic in election campaigns, two brutal murders seemingly performed by immigrants just prior to the campaign gave the Progress Party a better chance of getting their primary issue on the agenda.
         </p>
         
         <p> <i>The</i> most important topic during the election campaign both among the voters and in the media was, however, educational policy, as it had been in the parliamentary elections two years earlier as well as the last local elections in 1999. Interestingly, the leader of the Socialist Left Party, Kristin Halvorsen, made a few unclear and unfortunate statements about the party's school policies that upset many of the party's typical supporters, such as the public‐sector school teachers. She spent most of the last part of the campaign trying to convince voters that the most important thing was that ‘everybody knows that the Socialist Left Party is most devoted when it comes to education’. She did not really specify clearly the party's position. The general debate was not only about increased resources to the education sector, it was also a debate about individual ability to choose schools and topics. Typically, the bourgeois parties would favour individual choice, increased resources to private schools and so on, whereas the socialist parties and the Center Party would be in favour of one standardized norm to regulate all schools across the country as well as favouring more money to public schools. What remained a bit unclear, even after the election, was the Socialist Left Party's stand when it came to standardizations of topics and so forth. Another factor that might explain why the Socialist Left Party was doing well, and had been getting high scores on opinion polls for quite some time, was their clear position against the war in Iraq.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government coalition parties, and especially the Conservatives and the Christian People's Party, achieved a bad election result. It seemed quite clear that they were punished, among other things, for not having delivered all the anticipated tax cuts they had promised prior to the 2001 election as well as in the Government formation declaration. The Conservatives, who normally do well in local elections, got 18.3 per cent of the vote, a reduction of 3.2 per cent from the last local elections in 1999. Also worth noting is that their campaign was derailed due to an extensive focus on secret financial contributions to the party.</p>
         
         <p>The Christian People's Party had struggled with low support in the opinion polls for a long time, and the unsuccessful election campaign punctuated by political scandal and internal conflict did not help. The scandal was related to the leader of one of the regional branches who was charged with a rape that apparently had taken place ten years ago. In their article of association, the Christian People's Party have a rule stating that not only people who were convicted for sexual crime or offence, but also those being charged for or under investigation for such acts, could not hold honorary posts in the party. For a party stressing moral values, the charge against one of the leaders was very unfortunate.</p>
         
         <p>The police decided not to prosecute due to ‘insufficient evidence’, but party leader Haugland declared that this was not the same as acquittal, indicating that she still believed the women who reported the crime. The party leader's statement caused a huge internal disagreement over the faith of the regional leader – and whether he should still be allowed to run for the position of provincial mayor on behalf of the party. After rounds of debate, he was not allowed back to his old position, based on arguments of lacking trust and confidence. This scandal together with a similar scandal involving another politician from the same party destroyed most of the party's election campaign. However, it is unlikely that they would have gained much support from their original campaign strategy of focusing on how ‘alcopops’ should not be available in ordinary shops, but only sold in the wine and spirits monopoly shops. The Christian People's Party ended up getting 6.4 per cent of the votes, which was 2.8 per cent lower than at the previous local election, and their worst result since 1937. Labour had their worst local election since the 1920s with only 27.5 per cent of the vote. The other parties experienced only minor declines and the results were as follows: Red Election Alliance (1.6 per cent), Center Party (7.9 per cent) and the Liberals (3.9 per cent).</p>
         
         <p>As expected, vote turnout continued to decrease. With a participation rate of 59.3 per cent, it was the lowest turnout in a local election since 1922. The low levels of turnout, particularly in local elections, had been discussed for quite some time, and some effort had been made to reverse the trend and to increase electoral participation (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Aardal 2002</a></span>; <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">NOU 2001</a></span>: 3). Among other things, a few municipalities ran separate and direct elections for the mayor, but as in previous test elections, this did not seem to increase participation (see the entry on Norway in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 1999</i>; <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Larsen 2002</a></span>). Moreover, one municipality decided to run their election on a different date (three months earlier) in order to boost turnout and redirect the focus onto local matters rather than national politics. Although they succeeded in making their election about local issues, turnout in this municipality reached an all‐time low with 46.2 per cent and hence the experiment could not really be considered a success (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Skålnes 2004</a></span>).

         <p>In May 2003, the Storting made the final additions to a new law regulating elections. It built upon a new law from September 2002, which was applied for the first time during the 2003 local and provincial elections. What had been agreed upon in 2002 was a law regulating features common for both national and local elections, as well as matters more specific to local elections. The advance vote period was reduced by one month and voters could no longer use post offices and shops with such facilities to cast their advance vote. For financial reasons, it was now up to the municipality to decide where they would offer polling stations for advance votes. Typical locations were public libraries and the city hall, which were less available to the public than the post offices had been, but much less expensive. Closing hours on election day were also reduced by one hour, and voters can no longer put their ballot into a registered envelope, but must fold it and get it stamped. Moreover, it was up to the municipality whether or not they wanted to send out election cards to the electorate informing them about where to vote. All these changes caused problems. Not only were voters rejected at the door for being too late, but quite a few votes were also rejected since they lacked the official stamp required. Critics argued that this was a disaster, especially considering the Government's desire to increase turnout, but requests to arrange a new election were refused.</p>
         
         <p>Another change was made regarding voters’ ability to make changes on the ballot. Parties no longer have the opportunity to list their preferred candidates twice on the ballot, but can list their names in bold letters. Candidates listed in bold would get additional votes equal to 25 per cent of the total amount of votes for the party. Voters can still give additional personal votes for candidates by marking their names. However, they can no longer cross out candidates for whom they do not wish to vote. The argument behind this change was that politicians seriously dislike being deleted from the list and that it already was hard to get candidates to participate in local politics. The candidate vote regulation is somewhat different when it comes to provincial elections. Here a candidate has to get personal votes equal to at least 8 per cent of the party's votes in order to be elected before the party's pre‐ranked list of candidates. Moreover, for the provincial elections, parties cannot give additional votes to candidates by listing them in bold.</p>
         
         <p>In May, the Storting, after a significant political dispute, agreed on additions to the new election law to regulate elections to the national parliament. The number of representatives was increased from 165 to 169, with 150 geographical district candidates and 19 adjustment candidates – one for each constituency. In the previous law, there were only eight adjustment candidates. What was more controversial was a question of whether more sparsely populated areas still should be favoured in terms of the number of MPs. Regional politics have always been important in Norway and with a majority consisting of Labour, the Socialist Left Party, the Christian People's Party and the Center Party, the Storting decided upon a regional distribution formula to decide how many representatives each constituency should get. The formula gave a constituency 1 point for every inhabitant and 1.8 points per square kilometre. The minority consisting of the Conservatives and the Progress Party did not want any regional factors to matter. However, it was agreed that the distribution between the constituencies should be re‐evaluated every 8 years based on the regional distribution formula. Previously, the distribution of MPs has been fixed. It is also worth mentioning that there was some controversy over the proposal to include a more candidate‐oriented system for election to the national parliament. However, the Conservatives were the only party in favour, as all the other parties feared that this would cause personalization of the election campaign and more internal conflicts within parties.</p>

         <p>The war in Iraq naturally was also discussed in Norway. The general mood among the public was against the war. In February, just prior to the commencement of the war, 47 per cent of the Norwegian public were against a war under any circumstances and 40 per cent agreed that Norway should support the war only if it were sanctioned by the United Nations. The political cleavage was quite apparent in that most of the pro‐war support came from the Conservatives and the Progress Party. Approximately 20 per cent of the Progress Party supporters declared that Norway should support the United States regardless of the United Nation decision. On 21 March, the Norwegian Government restated that it would have supported the war only if the United Nations had come to an agreement. Whereas Prime Minister Bondevik from the Christian People's Party stressed how the war had been started without a foundation in international law, leader of the Conservative Party and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen pointed to the fact that international law was not a precise measure. He emphasized that there also were arguments in favour of not relying on a United Nations agreement, thereby revealing that there had been some dispute among the coalition parties. However, the official position of the Government achieved widespread support and was only criticized by the Progress Party. After the war was declared ‘over’ by President Bush, the Government, supported by Labour and the Progress Party, decided to send Norwegian troops to help the reconstruction process. The Socialist Left Party and Center Party were against sending aid which could be considered as indirect support for American and British warfare.</p>
         
         <p>Another international issue well known to create controversy in Norwegian politics was also present in 2003. Due to the enlargement of the European Union (EU), Norway needed to renegotiate the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement in order to gain access to the enlarged internal market. Part of the disagreement was over how much Norway should contribute to social and economic equalization in the new EU countries. Norway wanted to maintain the previous annual payment of 300 million Norwegian kroner. The EU however demanded 3.7 billion. After rounds of negotiation and diplomacy, the annual payment was set at 1.7 billion. The EEA revision created a new domestic interest for Norway's connection to the EU. Those in favour of Norwegian membership had for a long time argued that the EEA ‘compromise’ from 1994 no longer was enough to achieve sufficient influence. The parties that were against both Norwegian membership and the EEA agreement used this opportunity to stress that there were alternatives, and particularly pointed to Switzerland's free trade agreement. Most public opinion polls in 2003 showed a small majority in favour of EU membership, and Prime Minister Bondevik stated that he would rethink his position against Norwegian membership.</p>
         
         <p>For another member of the Government, Minister of Employment and Administration Victor D. Norman, 2003 was a troublesome year. With a proposition to soften up regulations preventing temporary employment, he started a major conflict with the LO trade union. This resulted in several of the major unions withdrawing from a committee working on a new Labour Act. Parallel to the conflict with the trade unions, Norwegian media in November revealed that the minister had violated public regulations for entertainment allowance on several occasions. This was particularly embarrassing as it was a set of regulations the minister himself was responsible for implementing. The matters were brought forward to the Storting control committee, and many speculated that the minister would withdraw. He apologized, and no no‐confidence motion was tabled by either of the opposition parties.</p>
         
         <p>Contrary to earlier years, the budget negotiation did not turn out to be protracted negotiations with different parts of the opposition. As in the last two years, the coalition Government first turned to the Progress Party, but negotiations soon collapsed. The Government then turned to Labour, who surprisingly almost immediately came to an agreement. Not only was it expected that the budget negotiations would dominate most of the autumn as they had previously, moreover Labour and the Conservatives have always been the main opponents in Norwegian politics. Labour was happy that the Government gave up on their demand to increase temporary employment and reduce taxes in 2004. They also achieved financial support for their fight against unemployment. However, the changes on the overall budget were very small. In the opinion polls, Labour was the only party rewarded for the agreement.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that two of the parties decided to change leaders in 2003. In March, the Center Party elected Åslaug Marie Haga to take over as party leader. The change was interpreted as the result of bad figures and the party's failing support since its most recent golden age in the early 1990s. The Christian People's Party also decided to change their leader. After having re‐elected Valgerd Svarstad Haugland as party leader at their annual meeting in May, Ms Haugland declared half a year later that she would withdraw as party leader. The main reason for this decision appears to have been an internal report discussing the events of the campaign and the low levels of support for the party. It is interesting to note that during the internal conflicts stirring within the party, it was party leader Haugland who got most of the heat, while Prime Minister Bondevik came out clear.</p>
