         <p>This was a turbulent year in Canadian politics. It opened with a Liberal government united behind a new leader and looking forward to winning a big majority in the election to come. It ended with the Liberals enmeshed in scandal, clinging to power in a minority government with gloomy prospects.</p>
         
         <p>The Martin government that took office in mid‐December 2003 portrayed itself as a fresh new Liberal team – most of its members had not served in the previous Chrétien government. Brimming with confidence, they moved to have the implementation of new electoral boundaries speeded up so that they could call an election in the spring rather than wait for the late summer when the regular decennial revisions to the electoral map would otherwise be in place. Their principal opponents were engaged in uniting the Progressive Conservative and the Canadian Alliance parties (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2004</a></span>) and in organizing a membership vote to chose their new Conservative Party of Canada's leader. That contest was easily won by Stephen Harper who had only recently won the Alliance leadership and had been one of the key actors in the merger process. As Harper represented a western brand of conservatism rejected by central Canadians in the elections of the 1990s, the Liberals were anxious to get to the polls sure that a fourth consecutive majority awaited them.
         </p>
         
         <p>The one cloud on the horizon was an investigation by the Auditor General that indicated that large sums of public money had gone unaccounted for in federal government sponsorship programmes. Those programmes, run on instruction from the Prime Minister's office, had been designed to increase the visibility of the national government in the province of Quebec in the aftermath of the very close referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1995 (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 1996</a></span>). Given that Parliament had been prorogued during the period of government transition, the Auditor General's principal report was not tabled until February. Thus it was that the new Martin government, rather than the old Chrétien one, was forced to deal with the revelation that perhaps CAN$100 million of CAN$250 million had been paid out for little or no work. More damaging to the government was the suggestion that individuals closely tied to the party, and its advertising agencies, in Quebec were deeply involved. Prime Minister Martin moved to try and distance his government from any association with the implicated individuals and their activities. In quick measure he recalled the Ambassador to Denmark (who had been the Chrétien government's key political minister in Quebec), and then suspended the Chief Executives of major crown (public) corporations such as Via Rail and Canada Post, both of whom had been leading figures in previous Liberal governments. The President of the Treasury Board sought to reassure Canadians that this would not happen again by announcing a new merit‐based system for the appointment of CEOs to crown corporations. The problem was Martin had been Minister of Finance during the period in which most of this had occurred and, despite his protestations of ignorance and innocence, many thought he had some responsibility. As the police began to make arrests, the scandal grew into an all‐consuming issue in Quebec, and it became increasingly clear that the Martin government was not going to be able to disassociate itself from its predecessor – the Liberal brand had been severely tarnished.
         </p>
         
         <p>The new electoral map increased the number of constituencies by 7 to 308. One of the last measures of the previous government had been to change completely the basis for party and election financing by providing for large state subsidies to the parties. As annual allowances were to be based on the number of votes won in the previous election, all parties now had an incentive to campaign in every district, irrespective of the prospects of actually winning the seat. As it turned out, the Green Party, which won no seats, took advantage of this provision telling potential supporters that their votes would not be wasted for they could now be transformed into money. They were successful and (by passing the threshold of 2 per cent) the party will now receive over CAN$1 million annually for their organisational and political activities. The other institutional change to note followed a Supreme Court decision to strike down the section of the Election Act requiring a party to nominate 50 candidates in order to be registered and have its label on the ballot. The requirement is now simply one.</p>
         
         <p>As the campaign developed, it was clear the Liberals were in trouble. In Quebec, reaction against them was rebounding to the advantage of the sovereigntist <i>Bloc québécois</i>. As the only significant alternative to the Liberals in the province, it was well placed to increase its seat share. In the rest of the country, the Conservatives focused on the scandal and campaigned on the throw‐the‐rascals‐out theme of ‘Demand Better’. By the latter part of the campaign, the two major parties were locked into an even race – within the margins of error of the national opinion pollsters. At that point, the Conservatives began to muse publicly about forming a majority government and the Liberals responded by warning Canadians that the Conservatives had a ‘secret agenda’ that would undermine the health care and social security systems voters had come to depend upon. By voting day, few expected a clear outcome; fewer than ever voted – turnout fell again (for the fifth consecutive election) to an all‐time low of just over 60 per cent of those on the register.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Liberals saw their vote and seat share fall, but survived as the largest party in the House of Commons by dominating the large central province of Ontario, winning 75 of its 106 districts. That province's reluctance to accept the new Conservative Party (it won only 24 of the districts) meant that the Conservatives would continue with a heavily western caucus. The merger on the right had not been an obvious electoral success for the new party's share of the vote was 8 points lower than the Progressive Conservatives and Alliance had managed between them in 2000. It is clear that the Conservatives have a long way to go in central and eastern Canada before they repair the electoral damage created by the 1993 split. By contrast, the other two significant parties in the election – the social democratic New Democratic Party and the <i>Bloc québécois</i>– both saw their vote and seat share grow.
         </p>
         
         <p>While the result put the Liberals back into office, they were left in a minority with little prospect that another election might change the balance of political forces. The new Commons is very delicately balanced, for even with NDP support (given the re‐election of Speaker Milliken, a Liberal), the government was left with one less than half the votes of the House. The chastened Prime Minister began to woo popular support by promising the provincial premiers the Liberals would pump CAN$18 billion more into the health care system over the next six years. Yet important as this issue and others (especially trade relations with the United States) are, the sponsorship scandal continued to dominate the national political agenda. The government appointed a Commission of Inquiry, headed by Justice John Gomery of Quebec, before the election in an attempt to take the issue out of politics. In fact, the Commission's televised hearings kept the issue on top of the political agenda throughout the year, haunting Parliament, souring the public and strengthening the separatist forces in Quebec. By the end of the year, it was apparent that the scandal was not going to disappear quickly and would likely colour inter‐party relations in Parliament and the county until the next general election.</p>
         
         <p>Politics in the regions went on as usual. In Nunavut, a territorial election was held without using political parties to choose the 19 members of their ‘consensus government’ assembly. With only 29,000 people spread across 2 million square kilometers, political parties have yet to take hold there. In Alberta, the Progressive Conservative Party (which survives in the provinces despite disappearing nationally) was easily re‐elected for the tenth consecutive time. One party may have taken too strong a hold there.</p>
         
         <p>Electoral reform continues to be a significant issue for many. Several provinces are pursuing a reform agenda, although in quite different ways. By the end of the year, it appeared that three provinces were seriously considering rather different versions of a mixed‐member proportional system; in British Columbia, a 160‐member Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform voted overwhelmingly to recommend a version of the Single Transferable Vote. That recommendation will go directly to public referendum in May 2005 when the province will hold the first fixed‐date election in Canadian experience.</p>
