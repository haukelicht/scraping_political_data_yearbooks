         <p>In his traditional New Year's speech, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen (Venstre, V) addressed one of the thorniest issues in Danish politics for many years: abolishing the early retirement scheme (<i>efterlønnen</i>). He mentioned how demographic developments meant that there will be fewer young people and more elderly citizens in the future and how every time five persons retired from the labour market, only four would be taking their place. It was therefore necessary for more people to work longer; otherwise, the economy will be unable to support the core welfare services in the future. The Danish government therefore intended to propose legislation for the gradual phasing out of early retirement.

         <p>Prime Minister Rasmussen (V) and Conservative Party leader Lene Espersen had agreed at a meeting shortly before New Year that Venstre – and only Venstre – would market the government's decision to abolish the early retirement scheme in the very first days after the New Year's speech. While the Conservatives were renowned for wanting to abolish early retirement, Venstre had previously flatly rejected doing so. Venstre therefore found itself with a considerable problem explaining the party's new position, and Espersen accepted that they had a special need to be the first to be able to run with the ball.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservative MPs expressed considerable dissatisfaction with how the party had just won a great victory, but Venstre was being allowed to steal the spotlight. Together with consistently falling support in the opinion polls, this added to the pressure on Espersen. On 13 January, she announced that she was stepping down as party chairperson due to the crisis in which the party found itself. She had direct experience with destructive conflicts between party factions in the 1990s and now found that another such conflict was in the offing. In order to avoid such a self‐destructive course of events, Espersen chose to step down while retaining her position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 14 January, the Conservative MPs elected Lars Barfoed as their new leader, and in March the party members elected him party chairman.</p>
         
         <p>The media revealed that stateless Palestinians had been denied Danish citizenship over a ten‐year period, which violated United Nations conventions. The question was whether the Ministry for Integration Affairs had deliberately circumvented the law. When the opposition dug deeper into how long the Minister of Integration Birthe Rønn Hornbech had known about the mistake, she refused to answer more questions. This reinforced the suspicions among the opposition parties that the minister was complicit in something illegal. On the background of the content in the report that Prime Minister Rasmussen had requested from her, he decided to remove Birthe Rønn Hornbech as Minister for Integration Affairs and Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs on 8 March.</p>
         
         <p>Hornbech's exit triggered a minor cabinet shuffle. Minister of Development Søren Pind (V) now found himself responsible for an additional ministry, becoming the new Integration Minister. Minister of Cultural Affairs Per Stig Møller (C) also became responsible for the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs. Minister of Education Tina Nedergaard (V) chose to step down due to personal reasons and was replaced by Minister of Taxation Troels Lund Poulsen (V). The Ministry of Taxation was entrusted to political spokesman Peter Christensen (V), who in turn was replaced by Ellen Trane Nørby (V).</p>
         
         <p>In Denmark as elsewhere, the so‐called ‘financial crisis’ necessitated action from the political system, and short‐sighted as well as longer‐sighted reforms were carried out aimed at economic recovery. In mid‐April, the government presented a proposal for a balanced budget in 2020. The most politically controversial and important element in the 2020 plan was abolishing early retirement for everyone aged 45 and younger at the end of 2010, gradually reducing the length of the period for other age groups to be able to opt for early retirement, and gradually increasing the age of retirement. In addition to early retirement reform, the plan also included major savings on the defence budget, support to students, eradication of the disability pension scheme and the introduction of new restrictive budget rules and a statutory ceiling on public spending so that public finances would only represent 27 per cent of the total economy.</p>
         
         <p>The responses from the other parties indicated that it might prove difficult for the government to gain majority support for its 2020 plan in the form in which it had been presented. The Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party, which had formed a coalition for a couple of years, refused to participate in abolishing early retirement, and the Red–Green Alliance shared this position. This was to be expected. They were willing to go along with minor adjustments, but not outright elimination. The same was the case with respect to the government's stable support party – the Danish People's Party. Conversely, the Social Liberals had strongly advocated for the outright elimination of early retirement for many years. The government's problem was that the Social Liberals had unambiguously declared that Social Democratic leader Helle Thorning‐Schmidt was their choice as Prime Minister to lead a new government after the impending election, which had to be held by November. As most observers saw it, it was therefore difficult to imagine that the party would join a settlement with the government on a question that was so central to the incumbent government's policy and so much against the rest of the opposition.</p>
         
         <p>It was therefore rather surprising when it became apparent that the Social Liberals remained at the negotiating table for serious talks with the government and the Danish People's Party. The Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party left the negotiations because the government had terminated the current agreement on early retirement from 2006. Terminating this agreement wiped the slate clean. The government's ambition was therefore to keep the Social Liberals at the table as long as possible as a way of displaying the division between the opposition parties. However, this required that the Danish People's Party abandon their opposition to abolishing early retirement.</p>
         
         <p>Since 2001, practice had developed that every time support was required from the Danish People's Party for the government's economic policy, they in turn presented demands regarding more restrictive immigration and justice policy. This was again the case. The requirements included new and increased measures against gang crime, permanent and tightened border control, stiffer sentencing for rape and home invasions, and new point systems for newly arrived foreigners making use of Danish welfare services.</p>
         
         <p>If there are two Danish parties that are traditionally opposed on immigration and justice policy, it is the Social Liberals and Danish People's Party. It was therefore necessary for the government to divide the negotiations into two parallel processes: the negotiations dealing with early retirement and economic policy and others dealing with the other questions. The Social Liberals did not participate in the latter and would not support the result.</p>
         
         <p>A settlement between the government, the Danish People's Party and the Social Liberals was reached on 13 May. Early retirement was not abolished outright, but the early retirement period was reduced from five to three years by increasing the age of early retirement by a half‐year per year starting in 2014, meaning that those born in the second half of 1959 or later could only receive early retirement for three years. Moreover, the age of retirement was gradually increased from 65 to 67 years of age, just as pension assets were to be deducted from early retirement payments.</p>
         
         <p>The price the government had to pay to the Danish People's Party for breaking their previously consistent refusal to make cuts to the early retirement scheme was to meet the party's aforementioned demands. The agreement on border control met opposition from the European Commission and especially Germany, who saw the new policy as a violation of the Schengen Agreement. As the Social Liberals did not sign off on this part of the settlement, the Danish People's Party alone could not provide majority support, so the government was forced to negotiate with a couple of independent MPs to secure the majority support for the government in exchange for minor concessions.</p>
         
         <p>The early retirement settlement created a new parliamentary situation. According to Danish parliamentary tradition, when a political settlement is terminated – as was the case with the 2006 settlement – a new reform can first be passed after elections have been held so that the electorate is able to consider the new proposal when deciding where to put their ‘x’ on the ballot. The Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party declared that they would annul the cuts made to early retirement if the two parties were able to form a majority after an election. The four parties behind the new settlement declared that they would respect the settlement if they had a majority to do so, even if the Social Liberals were to be in a majority together with the Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party and Helle Thorning‐Schmidt became the Prime Minister. The Social Liberals had re‐established their position as the decisive party in the middle of the political spectrum by ensuring a new government and Prime Minister while at the same time maintaining the early retirement reform. The Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party had to accept the situation if they wanted to form a new government.</p>
         
         <p>The Folketing elections had to be held by November 2011. Rumours had been circulating throughout the spring about how the Prime Minister was on the verge of pushing the proverbial button. The strength of these rumours increased after the government had ensured the support for the early retirement reform and divided the opposition. Nevertheless, the opinion polls consistently indicated that there was majority support for the so‐called ‘Red Bloc’ (Social Democrats, Socialist People's Party and Social Liberals). For this and other reasons, the Prime Minister hesitated. He finally called the election on 26 August, to be held on 15 September 2011. This was ultimately brought about because the government could not reach agreement with the Danish People's Party on parts of an economic growth package and the fact that the opinion polls had started shifting in a more positive direction for the government as well as a number of reasons of a more practical nature. This was the latest that elections could be held if a government was to be formed before the parliament assembled for a new session in the beginning of October.</p>
         
         <p>The central theme of the election was naturally which government was to be formed after the election. Would the incumbent government continue with the support of the Danish People's Party and Liberal Alliance – the so‐called ‘Blue Bloc’ – or would a new government be formed? And if the latter were the case, which parties would be involved? For the first time ever, the Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party campaigned together as a united Red Bloc. The problem was that it was unlikely that the two parties would be able to form a majority on their own and would therefore depend on support from the Red–Green Alliance and the Social Liberals. Both parties had pledged their support for Social Democrat leader Helle Thorning as the new Prime Minister for a Social Democrat‐led government. Whether the Social Liberals would actually participate in such a government remained unresolved and would be determined by whether the party would be able to obtain the necessary concessions, particularly as regards economic policy, and there was disagreement here with the Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party on a number of important points. This was demonstrated clearly in connection with the early retirement reform.</p>
         
         <p>In very simplified terms, the decisive lines of political division between the two blocs were their respective understandings of how Denmark was to solve the problems related to the so‐called ‘financial crisis’. The Blue Bloc was hoping to be able to make the election about fiscal responsibility – that the public sector should save and avoid loaning further funds, balancing the state budget in 2020 while maintaining a firm and fair immigration policy. The Red Bloc also had plans for a balanced budget by 2020 (both blocs had their own so‐called ‘2020 plan’), but rather than achieving this via savings in the public sector, their plan was to kick‐start the economy through publicly financed growth‐promoting initiatives and job‐creation schemes. In other words, the disagreement concerned the balance between the importance and influence of the state versus the market. For the first time since 2001, the economy was at the top of the agenda among voters and politicians alike. However, the Red Bloc was also calling for the elimination of the influence of the Danish People's Party's on value policy issues.</p>
         
         <p>The electorate was bombarded with economic prognoses and calculations, plans and accounts that were difficult for the ordinary person on the street to figure out. With that background, it ultimately became a question of credibility and whether the voters simply wanted something new after ten years of a right‐of‐centre government. Opinion polls indicated the latter, even though the Red Bloc's advantage gradually shrank as election day approached.</p>
         
         <p>The result was a narrow majority for a new government despite the stagnation of the support for the Social Democrats and considerable losses incurred by the Socialist People's Party. It was the great gains reaped by the Red–Green Alliance and Social Liberals that ensured the majority. The Social Liberals thus came to play a strong position in the subsequent government negotiations. The end‐result was a minority coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats, the Social Liberals and the Socialist People's Party. The latter found themselves as part of a government for the first time since the creation of the party in 1959, and Denmark had its first female Prime Minister, Helle Thorning‐Schmidt (S). The government's fundamental parliamentary support had to be found with the left‐wing Red–Green Alliance, known for its very influential and leftist central committee.</p>
         
         <p>The new government named 23 ministers on 2 October, only two of whom had previous experience. At the same time, the government presented a comprehensive 95‐point programme that it wanted to pass. It became clear that the Social Liberals had the greatest influence on the content, and that the Social Democrats and Socialist People's Party subsequently had to use considerable energy to defend themselves against accusations from the opposition and the media about having broken campaign promises. The government had stumbled out of the starting blocks.</p>
         
         <p>The government produced limited results for the rest of 2011. It was able to make some adjustments to the budget proposed by the previous government, the control of Denmark's borders was not tightened as otherwise planned, and softer immigration policy was passed. It will be in the course of 2012, when the new government's array of legislative proposals is debated, that it will genuinely become possible to feel that Denmark has a new government after ten years.</p>
