         <p>Some tensions, especially around budget and tax issues, continued to prevail within the non‐typical Michel I federal coalition that was formed in 2014 (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). The overall socioeconomic climate remained quite tense, amidst a disputed economic record of the federal executive and some trade union mobilizations. Major corruption scandals erupted or continued to unfold, while an unexpected coalition change reshuffled some cards on the French‐speaking side. The overall party‐political atmosphere gradually became more nervous as all parties began to gear up for the next electoral cycle with the local elections in 2018 followed by the regional, federal and European elections in 2019.

         <p>As in the previous years, the largest party in the Michel I government, the Nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N‐VA), managed to keep its word and kept community conflicts on hold – in spite of the fact that it still cherishes Flemish independence. The quite unique and asymmetric Michel I cabinet (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>), composed of three Flemish parties and only one French‐speaking party (the Liberal Reformist Movement – MR), was therefore able to avoid tensions on the community front. All intra‐cabinet conflicts occurred between the three Flemish coalition parties, especially around socioeconomic issues, and the francophone prime minister often had to act as appeaser between them.
         </p>
         
         <p>The migrant crisis, and in particular alleged collaborations with the Sudanese government, seriously hit Michel I. Several political opposition and civil society leaders repeatedly called for the Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration Theo Francken (N‐VA) to resign, to no avail as the Michel I coalition partners stayed loyal to a quite hard line on illegal migrants.</p>
         
         <p>The crisis in the Walloon regional government slightly affected the federal government in that Michel I lost one minister. As a consequence of the coalition change in the Walloon cabinet, Willy Borsus became Minister President of the Walloon Region and stood aside for his party colleague Denis Ducarme, former parliamentary group leader at the Chamber of Representatives.</p>

         <p>The fourth year of the legislature was characterized by a few changes in the Chamber of Representatives. In Socialist Party Different (sp.a) (Flemish‐speaking Socialists), Johan Vande Lanotte was replaced by Annick Lambrecht on 10 January, and Ann Vanheste was replaced by Youri Casier on 11 December. In the PS (French‐speaking Socialist Party), Willy Demeyer (PS) was replaced by Jacques Chabot on 2 November. In the N‐VA (Flemish Nationalists), Zuhal Demir was replaced by Wim Van der Donckt on 9 March because of her appointment as Secretary of State of Struggle against Poverty, Equal Opportunities, the Disabled, Science Policy, in charge of Large Cities. Finally, in the MR (French‐speaking Liberals), Denis Ducarme was replaced by Isabelle Galant on 28 July following his appointment as Minister of Middle Classes, the Self‐employed, Small and Medium‐sized Companies, Agriculture and Social Integration.</p>

         <p>Most parties held regular party congresses, but none announced a major ideological turn – perhaps with the exception of the PS which initiated a turn towards a more left‐wing stance as it had to face growing competition by the Maoist Workers’ Party of Belgium‐Left Opening! (PTB‐Go!) party.</p>
         
         <p>On the Flemish‐speaking side, only one party needed to (re‐)elect a leader: the N‐VA. Bart De Wever, elected for the first time in 2004, was chosen for a fifth mandate on 18 November by an all‐member vote, with a 98.5 per cent majority and without any competitor. No leadership or institutional party change occurred on the French‐speaking side.</p>

         <p>As a result of the ‘sixth state reform’ that was agreed upon in November 2013 (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>) and following its stepwise implementation from 2014 onwards (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>, <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>, <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>), further competences with associated budgets and staff were transferred from the federal to the regional/community level. The main competences that were in effect transferred on 1 January touched upon some specific healthcare policies: tobacco withdrawal treatments and home delivery of some healthcare services. A final batch of competences is due to be transferred on 1 January 2018.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12200-sec-0070-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>On the socioeconomic front, with a federal government announcing socioeconomics as its top agenda, even though 69,000 new jobs were created during the year (a figure slightly above that of 2016), a significant proportion of them were part‐time or flexible jobs. The economic growth went up to a still quite meagre 1.7 per cent, a figure below that of most of the other Western countries. Bankruptcy figures were higher than in 2016, and the plant closure at America's Caterpillar in Gosselies became effective involving, together with redundancies at suppliers, about 5000 job losses.</p>
         
         <p>In that mixed climate, a general collective‐bargaining agreement was reached early in the year, ensuring less tension between unions and employers. Nonetheless, the year was marked by some large union‐led strikes and demonstrations aimed at the federal government, which responded by denouncing them as purely political protests instrumentalized especially by the socialists.</p>
         
         <p>In September, State Secretary for Asylum and Immigration, Theo Francken (N‐VA), caused further controversy by inviting a Sudanese delegation of officials to Brussels in spite of the likelihood that they were security agents sent to identify opponents and, whenever possible, arrange for their repatriation. As, according to testimonies of returned refugees, some of those were tortured upon their forced return, deportations had to be suspended pending an investigation. Francken also began to receive stark criticism, especially from French‐speaking opposition parties, for a draft bill that would enable the police to perform house visits to citizens hosting illegal migrants so as to bring the latter in closed detention centres and eventually deport them if applicable.</p>
         
         <p>The Publifin affair, the political–financial scandal that erupted at the end of 2016 (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>: 34–35), involving corrupt public representatives within large public intermunicipal structures in the Walloon area of Liège, was not the only one to undermine further public confidence in the political system. In the Flemish region, too, a similar scandal was unearthed at the beginning of the year: the Publipart affair. In June, another corruption scandal wrought havoc. Implying, among others, Yvan Mayeur, PS Mayor of the City of Brussels, it led to his resignation and the setting up of a parliamentary investigation committee. In the so‐called Kazakhgate scandal (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>: 34), the parliamentary investigation committee that had been set up in late 2016 seemed to be going nowhere.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the area of security, in the wake of the 2016 terrorist attacks at the national airport and in the Brussels subway (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12200-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12200-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>), the high alert level (3 on a scale of 4) was maintained throughout the year.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the French‐speaking side, a serious political crisis was triggered by the sudden coalition moves of the leader of the Francophone Humanist Democratic Centre (cdH), Benoît Lutgen. On 19 June, without warning his ministers in the Walloon regional government, the Brussels regional government and the community government of the Fédération Wallonie‐Bruxelles, he announced at a press conference that he had discontinued the coalition with the PS (Socialists), his main coalition partner in these sub‐state executives. He did manage to create a new coalition in the Walloon executive with the Liberals (MR) under the leadership of the MR minister‐president Willy Borsus installed on 28 July after a constructive vote of confidence. However, in the Brussels regional executive coalition, composed of PS, cdH, Democratic Federalist Independent (DéFI) (the former FDF (<i>Fédéralistes Démocrates Francophones</i>)), as well as the Christian Democrat and Flemish (CD&amp;V), Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) and sp.a, no alternative coalition could be brought together. After some months of ambiguity, this ‘caretaking’ executive again became effective. Consequently, it was also impossible to form a new executive coalition for the Fédération Wallonie‐Bruxelles. These coalition change attempts, that occurred amongst francophone parties only, did not really concern the Flemish parties and in particular did not lead to changes in the federal and Flemish regional coalitions. Only the N‐VA applauded Lutgen's initiatives, as it had been pushing to oust the Socialists since 2010 at all levels.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another, entirely unexpected potential crisis came from Catalonia, when its independentist minister president fled the country and settled in Brussels. Flemish Nationalists, and the N‐VA as their main party and also by now the predominant party in the federal and Flemish government, found themselves in an ambiguous position. While individual N‐VA members were allowed to express full support for Catalan independence and their ‘brothers in exile’, the official position of the party was much more careful. The N‐VA realized that full support for Catalan independence and their leaders in exile in Brussels would reinforce their own image as a separatist party, while the entire compromise that had enabled the formation of the Michel I government (and that presumably would enable a coalition continuation in 2019) was that they would put ethnolinguistic issues into the political fridge and concentrate instead on socioeconomic topics on which a (centre‐)right compromise could be found more easily.</p>
         
         <p>The N‐VA minister of internal affairs of the Flemish government, Liesbeth Homans, nominated the francophone Valérie Geeurickx (independent, but former vice‐president of the ‘Flemish‐unfriendly’ FDF until 2014) mayor of Linkebeek, after decades of linguistic troubles in that small Flemish commune in the Brussels periphery. Successive Flemish ministers of internal affairs had refused the candidates proposed by the overwhelming francophone majority in the local council of the formally Flemish commune, granting since 1963 linguistic facilities to the large francophone majority. This eased tensions at least on the surface, while Flemish nationalists took on to scrutinize carefully every single word of the new mayor and her local executive – technically, the latter are forbidden to use French during municipal council meetings.</p>
