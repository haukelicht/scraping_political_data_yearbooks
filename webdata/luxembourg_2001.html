         <p>The Minister of Interior had extensive consultations with all the political parties represented in Parliament in 2001 and throughout 2002 in order to reform the Electoral Law, before presenting a draft bill to Parliament in November 2002. The modifications proposed were rather modest, dealing mainly with local elections. The major innovation is the granting of voting rights to non‐European Union (EU) citizens residing in Luxembourg.</p>
         
         <p>Following this, a debate was launched about regular public financing of political parties, which found all the parties in favour of such a measure, after some initial hesitation on the part of the Liberals (DP). Political parties that get more than 5 per cent of the vote in national elections benefit from some reimbursement for expenditures in relation to electoral campaigns. Subsidies to the parliamentary groups are another, indirect, form of public financing (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; De Winter 2003</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government also discussed proposals made by the Parliamentary Committee for Institutions and Constitutional Reform and agreed on the principle of a future amendment of the Constitution in order to allow for a shortening of the process of constitutional revisions. Instead of requiring general elections between the parliamentary vote on the list of articles of the Constitution to be amended and the vote on the amendments themselves – the latter had to be taken by a two‐thirds majority with a quorum of three‐quarters of all Members of Parliament (MPs) (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; De Winter 2000</a></span>, <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2003</a></span>) – the new process would only require a minimum of three months within the same parliamentary term between the two votes. The decision would require a two‐thirds majority, but with no special requirement in terms of the quorum required. Following the idea developed in the Prime Minister's 2001 State of the Nation speech, some form of direct democracy would be introduced into the constitutional amendment process, as it would allow for the organisation of a referendum between the two votes in Parliament. The Government, Parliament (at least one‐third of all MPs) or citizens (at least 15 per cent of the population eligible to vote) could call for such a referendum that would nevertheless remain non‐binding. As any amendment of the Constitution still has to go through the existing process, all these proposals will only be dealt with in the next parliamentary term.

            <p>In October and November 2002, both the Socialist Party (LSAP) and the Christian Social Party (CSV) adopted new manifestos which confirm centrist tendencies and their eagerness to position themselves in the middle of the political spectrum, the middle‐class vote increasingly determining the outcome of elections.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

            <p>In early 2002, most of the banks present in Luxembourg announced drastic measures to cut down their operational costs, including a freeze on recruitment. The banking sector represents more than 30 per cent of the GDP and some 42 per cent of the Luxembourg government's revenues. These announcements were the first indication of a dramatic change in the economic climate. In October 2002, STATEC (the government statistical office) was obliged to make a radical correction of its figures regarding economic growth, including for the year 2001. Estimates for that year had been set at a growth rate of 5.5 per cent of GDP, but it turned out that the economy grew by barely 1 per cent. Hence, when in the beginning of 2002 the growth rate was still estimated at 5 per cent, STATEC came to the conclusion that a mere 0.5 per cent would be more realistic for 2002 and 2003. This is a major change after a period of 15 years of exceptionally high growth rates, with a yearly average above 5 per cent. These corrections dominated the political debate until the end of the year, and obliged the government in November to modify, although only slightly, its budget for 2003 that originally was based on a growth of 5 per cent of GDP. Whilst the increase of the proportion of public expenditures (compared to the 2002 budget) was supposed to reach 8 per cent, it was revised to less than 6 per cent. Most of the effort was made not on cuts in expenditures, however, but rather on the delaying of some important investment projects.</p>
            
            <p>Shortly before the dramatic revision of growth rates and expected fiscal revenue, some very generous measures were passed by Parliament, including a substantial salary increase for civil servants in March 2002 and a new pensions scheme in June 2002, increasing pension benefits following the conclusions reached a year earlier by the social partners and political parties (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 1028–1032).
            </p>
            
            <p>In the social field, a regrouping of the trade unions representing employees outside of the two major unions (OGB‐L and LCGB) took place in January under the leadership of ALEBA. This regrouping, which represents about 70 per cent of the people employed in the banking sector, was meant to exert pressure on the Government which was in the process of modifying the 1965 law on collective bargaining (one of the new criteria was to reach a threshold of representativeness of both workers and employees). The 1965 law determines which trade unions are considered nationally representative and therefore can be represented in the tripartite organisations steering most social policy issues (National Tripartite Conference, Economic and Social Council, Social Security Bodies, etc. – for further information on the Luxembourg neo‐corporatist model, see Allegrezza et al. 2003). For the time being, only OGB‐L and LCGB meet these requirements. The Government introduced a new draft law in November 2002 that introduced the notion of ‘sector representativeness’, thereby meeting some of the demands of the employees’ unions.</p>
            
            <p>In his declaration on the State of the Nation (May 2002), Prime Minister Jean‐Claude Juncker stated that Luxembourg's economy would need manpower in the coming years, and that such manpower could be sought in the future EU member countries. He also confirmed that the Government was in favour of granting dual citizenship to residents meeting some criteria, but argued that such a measure should be taken by the next government in order to let voters express their views on the issue.</p>
            
            <p>Immigration and the multicultural society were major issues throughout the year, for a number of reasons. First, one of the conclusions of the pensions debate was the acknowledgement that Luxembourg's resident population has to double in the years to come in order to live up to the generous pension promises (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 1028–1032). The perspective of the necessary and inevitable doubling of the resident population was met with considerable resistance and a public debate around the issue of the so‐called ‘700,000 <i>Einwohnerstaat</i>’ took place. A regrouping of most citizens’ initiatives opposing infrastructural measures (like public transport and housing, which require heavy investment and raise environmental concerns, but also education and hospital capacities, etc.), known as the ‘<i>Waat eng Zukunft fir Lëtzebuerg</i>?’ (What future for Luxembourg?) initiative seized the day and even threatened to constitute itself as a political party running for Parliament in order to stop the alleged megalomania of the political establishment. Second, the follow‐up of the regularisation operation (for illegal residents and asylum seekers) of 2001 was the repatriation of those who were refused the right to stay and who did not quit the country voluntarily. In November, the forced and collective repatriation of 23 ex‐Yugoslavians, including children who were attending school, was contested by a number of associations and led to some turmoil at Luxembourg Airport. Finally, debates went on about the education system and immigration, as the bad results of Luxembourg in the PISA Survey, revealed in late 2001 (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 1028–1032), were partly caused by the high proportion of foreign children who do not speak Luxembourgish at home.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, Luxembourg assured its EU partners and the United States of its cooperation in the fight against terrorism, especially in the field of the financing of terrorist groups and activities. In April, a bill proposal reforming the penal code was introduced by the Minister of Justice. Intentional terrorist acts, groupings, financing and money laundering, in and out of the country, will be added to the list of serious crimes. This question was also on the agenda of the Luxembourg presidency of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe (May–November 2002).</p>
            
            <p>The year 2002 was also marked by a number of events. First was the death of former Prime Minister Pierre Werner (CSV), at the age of 88, in late June. Altogether, Pierre Werner held a portfolio in government for 25 years, most of the time as Prime Minister (1959–1974 and 1979–1984) and Finance Minister, and was thus a particularly well‐known and well‐respected personality in Luxembourg. His statesman‐like qualities were also respected abroad, not only because of his longevity as Luxembourg's main representative, but also for his efforts in favour of the creation of a common European currency. It is intriguing but also significant to notice that Pierre Werner's predecessor as Prime Minister – Joseph Bech, CSV – was an active founding father of the European Community, and that the two personalities who took over his position as Prime Minister (in 1974 and 1984) both became Presidents of the European Commission (Gaston Thorn, DP and Jacques Santer, CSV).</p>
            
            <p>Finally, in November 2002, a small airplane owned by the Luxembourg company Luxair that took off in Berlin and was supposed to land at Luxembourg Airport, crashed in the Grand Duchy countryside and caused 20 deaths (most of them German). Although there were no casualties on the ground (all victims were passengers of the plane), this was the most dramatic accident in the aviation history of the country.</p>
            
            <p>A much more positive event took place in July, with the start of the <i>Tour de France</i> (bicycle race) from Luxembourg. Three stages were competed wholly or partially in Luxembourg, and the massive presence of athletes, sponsors, journalists and spectators made the summer of 2002 somewhat less quiet than usual.
