         <p>In December 2010, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) downgraded France from a ‘full’ to a ‘flawed’ democracy, along with fellow European Union Member States Greece, Italy and Slovenia (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">EIU 2010</a></span>: 16). The grounds included the ‘extremely low’ public confidence in the country's elites as well as in democracy itself; the overbearing power of the presidency in general and the ‘autocratic and domineering style of the current president, Nicolas Sarkozy’ in particular; sustained ‘pressure’ on media and individual freedoms; and the ‘violent rioting’ seen as ‘symptom[s] of the country's political malaise’. On several other scores too, France in 2010 gave cause for concern within and outside the country. Members of the Government and President Sarkozy himself found themselves mired in much‐publicised political scandals. Ongoing reforms – of the judiciary, of immigration and pensions policy, of the laws of <i>laïcité</i><a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a>– generated loud opposition, both on the streets and, significantly, within the establishment itself. Furthermore, the UMP's<a href="#en2" class="scrollableLink"><sup>2</sup></a> losses in the March regional elections underlined the political stalemate that characterised a political year slowly but inexorably overshadowed by the prospect of the 2012 presidential and legislative elections.

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> Scandals, protests and lies</h3>
            
            <p>Was there corruption at the heart of the Sarkozy system? A succession of scandals came to light in 2010, in part thanks to new media players such as website Mediapart with an appetite for investigation and exposure. In January 2010, in the spectacular ‘Clearstream’ affair, former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin found himself in court accused of involvement in a smear campaign dating back to 2004 that implicated Sarkozy (amongst others) in illicit party funding. Villepin was cleared, but the case subsequently went to appeal. Undeterred, Villepin launched his own party in November 2010 in an explicit challenge to Sarkozy's authority on the political right, and used the platform to air his belief in Sarkozy's involvement in another serious scandal reaching back into the 1990s, the so‐called ‘Karachigate’. This was the story of alleged links between the death in Pakistan in 2002 of eleven French defence engineers and illegal party funding, again involving Nicolas Sarkozy, it was alleged. More sensationalist still was the so‐called ‘Woerth‐Bettencourt affair’ that lasted for months, and first hit the news when Liliane Bettencourt, heiress to the l'Oréal fortune, became embroiled in an family affair of disputed inheritance and betrayals. This drama rapidly spun a web of accusations of official collusion in tax evasion on the Bettencourt fortune in exchange for illicit party funding for the UMP. Government minister Eric Woerth was accused of purportedly abetting Bettencourt in her payments to the UMP, while simultaneously holding the positions of Budget Minister (to March 2010) and UMP treasurer, and while his wife, employed by Bettencourt to manage her estate, assisted her employer in deceiving the tax authorities. Next came accusations that Nicolas Sarkozy himself had benefited from Madame Bettencourt's largesse to fund his 2007 presidential election campaign. Eric Woerth, his spouse Florence and the French President denied all charges. The former minister was subsequently cleared in an official government enquiry, but resigned as UMP treasurer, and in March 2010 was moved from the Budget Ministry to Social Affairs.</p>
            
            <p>In the wake and wash of the Bettencourt‐Woerth affair et al., but on a rather different scale, two government ministers, Alain Joyandet and Christian Blanc, resigned on 4 July, scapegoat style, over allegations of wrong‐doing concerning lavish expenses and lifestyles. In the same month, a UMP deputy lost his safe seat in a National Assembly by‐election to a candidate on the far left in a surprise result which could well have been a reaction to the sleaze that seemed to be encircling the UMP party and its high‐profile members. More sinister, and by way of further illustration of the climate surrounding politics in Sarkozy's France, the Elysée presidential palace was accused in September 2010 by France's daily newspaper <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Le Monde</i></a></span> of spying to uncover leaks in the Bettencourt case; and Carla Sarkozy‐Bruni, the president's wife, was rumoured to have applied pressure on the intelligence services to uncover the source of media tales of infidelity in the presidential couple.

            <p>In the midst of such apparently rampant sleaze in the highest of places, numerous tussles erupted in the course of 2010 between the executive branch of government, on the one hand, and the judiciary and legal professions, on the other, which, by and large, the Government lost. Proposals to eliminate the role of the independent investigating judge (<i>le juge d'instruction</i>) in favour of a more powerful state prosecutor reflected President Sarkozy's preferences and were widely resisted, as was the ongoing concentration of courts into fewer towns and centres across the country (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Ysmal 2009</a></span>). Similarly, activist courts themselves brought the Government to account, most notoriously over the practice of police detention (<i>la garde à vue</i>); here, historic rulings of non‐constitutionality and non‐compliance with EU law forced France repeatedly to review its legislative edifice. Furthermore, the Government's own legal advisor, the Council of State (<i>le Conseil d'État</i>) criticised President Sarkozy's high‐handed cancelling of commercial advertising on state television, and warned the Government that its proposed ‘burqa ban’ (see below) was likely to stretch the limits of legality and constitutionality. These challenges were themselves underpinned by the consequences of a landmark reform of the rules governing appeals to the Constitutional Council from 1 March 2010.<a href="#en3" class="scrollableLink"><sup>3</sup></a> Henceforth, courts could apply to the Council for rulings on sub judice court proceedings where the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution were deemed at risk. On the very first day of its application, an appeal was made regarding the constitutionality of the <i>garde à vue</i> laws themselves, and the reform is to be seen as a milestone in the ongoing and very public judicialisation of French politics.

         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss5"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss5-title"> Reforms and their opponents: Pensions, immigration and ‘integration’</h3>
            
            <p>Against such a backdrop of beleaguered political authority, not to mention economic cutbacks, President Sarkozy's flagship policy of raising the minimum age for retirement from 60 to 62, and for full pension entitlement from 65 to 67, was always going to be unpopular. Symbolically, the reform was also seen as an attack on key social gains of Socialist administrations of the Mitterrand years (1981–1995). This mix of resentments fuelled large‐scale, nationwide protests and demonstrations against the reforms in the early autumn of 2010; and widespread strikes at France's oil refineries and the blockades of fuel depots, ports, airports and rail networks all culminated in petrol shortages and police interventions on presidential order. None of this activity prevented the passing in parliament of the Government bill by late October 2010, and the movement against had been anything but united. Nevertheless, the scale of the response indicated that there had indeed been a widening of the ‘chasm between the country's citizens and its political elites’ in the course of 2010 (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">EIU 2010</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The year 2010 also saw the first stages of yet another bill on immigration – the fourth since Sarkozy became Interior Minister in 2003. The bill raised ever higher the bar for both recent and settled immigrants to demonstrate their ‘integration’ into French society and their allegiance to the country: in February 2010, citizenship was denied to a man accused of forcing his wife to wear the burqa. The new law followed a so‐called ‘great debate’ on national identity that had come to an ignominiously feeble close in April 2010, and it dovetailed with the law that began its passage through parliament in January 2010 intending to outlaw ‘clothing designed to cover the face’, to be implemented in April 2011. By the time of its promulgation in October 2010, the law had been tightened to cover all public spaces (with the exception, following review by the Constitutional Council, of ‘the exercising of religious freedom in places of worship open to the public’ (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Conseil constitutionnel 2010</a></span>)).
            </p>
            
            <p>With respect to the ongoing securitisation of its immigration and ‘integration’ agenda, the Government was by and large converging around a developing European norm – as well as building on its tactics for dealing with the populist appeal of the <i>Front national</i>; indeed, public opinion broadly supported the President's crackdown for its emphasis on the strengthening of French national identity. Nonetheless, France found itself in the eye of a storm of protest over its treatment of its Roma population when, over the summer of 2010, hundreds of Roma settlements around the country were dismantled, and thousands of their inhabitants were deported. Ostensibly carried out within the framework of permissible restrictions on the freedom of movement and residence within the EU, the developments nevertheless provoked the European Commission into strongly worded protests, and Paris was instructed to bring its legislation into line with prevailing EU directives. Significantly, there was some evidence that the French government was discriminating on racial and ethnic grounds, and a number of legal challenges were made by local French courts unwilling to blindly implement the policy diktats emanating from Paris.
            </p>
            
            <p>One outcome of these difficulties for the Government was the abolishment, in the November government reshuffle, of the controversial Ministry for Immigration, Integration and National Identity set up after the 2007 elections bringing Sarkozy to power (see Table 2). However, the disappearance of the Ministry, at the same time as the tightening of policy on immigration and <i>laïcité</i>, provided further signs of a government stuck in neutral on key political issues of the day. Such stalemate, moreover, was to be seen in the context of fractious and fractured party politics right across the political spectrum and the spectre of a new‐look <i>Front national</i> for 2011 after the retirement of its leader, Jean‐Marie le Pen.
            </p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss6"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss6-title"> From elections to reshuffle: Political stalemate?</h3>
            
            <p>The regional elections of 14 and 21 March 2010 were the last to be fought under the current system of regional government,<a href="#en4" class="scrollableLink"><sup>4</sup></a> and only the second under a mixed electoral system weighted towards the politics of electoral alliances designed to squeeze marginal parties – notably the <i>Front national</i>– out of the picture. The results were principally marked by the following characteristics. First was a sharp rise in the rate of abstention (49 per cent compared to 34 per cent in 2004). The conclusion drawn by President Sarkozy in this respect was that not enough people had voted for the results to count as a sign of any national trend. Second, nevertheless, was the failure of the UMP and its partners (running on presidential majority lists) to regain ground lost to the left in 2004; indeed, they lost a further region to the left (Corsica), leaving the presidential majority with only one region on mainland France (Alsace), and two other overseas (Guyana, and Reunion, the latter won from the left in this contest). Third, the left (both the <i>Parti socialiste</i> (Socialist Party, PS) and Europe‐Ecologie) was able to consolidate its strong showing in the 2009 elections to the European Parliament (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Cautrès 2010</a></span>) with a 52 per cent total share of the vote in the second round of the 2010 regionals. This is not to say that the left was united by their electoral success; far from it. In December 2010 the Socialist Party, for its part, met to organise the primaries that in October 2011 would nominate a single candidate for the 2012 presidential election. This had the immediate and predictable effect of generating early, rival bids for the nomination, hardly conducive to party unity. Fourth, the results of the <i>Front national</i> demonstrated that President Sarkozy's populist overtures to the far‐right electorate had not at all eliminated the party from the political scene, even though it lost 38 of the 156 seats it had won in the 2004 regional elections: with over 1 million votes representing nearly 10 per cent of votes cast in 2010, and the very likely prospect of leader Jean‐Marie le Pen being replaced early in 2011 by his charismatic daughter Marine, the FN showed it was still a political force to be reckoned with.
            </p>
            
            <p>Faced with these results, the President decreed that nothing would change other than his renewed determination to push ahead with planned reforms. Only ‘technical’ adjustments were to be made to the composition of the Government (see <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a>) at that time; but the Government did cancel the implementation of a carbon tax law, claiming that if enacted, the legislation would have put French competitiveness at risk in a context of non‐harmonised EU law in this respect. It is also the case that in the course of the following months, the Government set about a significant reshuffle of regional and departmental <i>préfets</i> (government appointees). This was one way for the Government to balance out the losses incurred in the regional elections, and was undertaken with a view to gaining some leverage over the implementation of the sensitive policies outlined above. No major changes occurred to the composition of the Government itself until November 2010, once the pensions bill was safely home and dry – and following the summer of scandal. The net result of the winter reshuffle (see <a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink">Table 2</a>) was that by the end of 2010, France had a younger, whiter, but less feminised government than before, still led by Prime Minister François Fillon, whose popularity continued to outstrip that of the President.<a href="#en5" class="scrollableLink"><sup>5</sup></a> Crucially, the Government contained fewer non‐UMP ministers than any of Fillon's previous governments, and several of the outgoing ministers immediately began to rally in opposition to President Sarkozy. Thus, by means of this consolidation of his government, President Sarkozy's own perilous journey towards 2012 had begun.

                        Note: 15 ministers left the government in this reshuffle, and nine new ministers were appointed. The new government comprised two ministers of state, 20 ministers and eight secretaries of state. The controversial Ministry of Immigration, Integration and National Identity was disbanded, and the immigration portfolio reverted to its usual ‘home’ of the Ministry of the Interior. Sports got its own portfolio, separate from Health. In <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Cautrès (2010</a></span>), secretaries of state are referred to as ‘junior ministers’; here, the terminology of ‘secretary of state’ has been maintained.

         <p>Did the developments of 2010 in France really constitute a fall from full democracy, as the Economist Intelligence Unit had it (EIU 2010)? In their challenges to the political executive, judicial and media actors certainly exerted counter power in an unprecedentedly sustained manner. Similarly, the French parliament defeated ‘the street’ over the matter of pensions reform, and this could be seen as a flexing of a democratic muscle widely considered to be weak in the Fifth French Republic, if not atrophied. However, it was hard to ignore the looming shadow of the 2012 elections, and the distorting effect it was already having on the play of politics. Elections to the French Presidency continue to generate much wishful thinking, and ridiculously high expectations of the persona of the President. Yet the post itself, for all its powers, is in practice hemmed in by the other branches of government, not to mention the interplay with the prime ministerial office, by public opinion, by France's deep interdependence within the European Union, and by its own short (five‐year) term. From this perspective, and faced with the ongoing challenges of an unstable external environment, and the party fragmentation on both the right and the left of the political spectrum, France in 2011 was unlikely to dissipate its ‘political malaise’ (EUI 2010).</p>
