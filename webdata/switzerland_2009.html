         <p>The party composition of the Swiss cabinet (Federal Council) remained unchanged in 2010. The seven‐member collegial executive consists of two representatives each of the FDP/PLR (Liberal Democrats) and the SPS/PSS (Social Democrats), as well as one representative each of the CVP/PDC (Christian Democrats), the SVP/UDC (Swiss People's Party) and the BDP/PBD (Conservative Democratic Party). The last major change in party composition was in 2008, when Federal Council member Eveline Widmer‐Schlumpf switched from the SVP/UDC to the newly formed BDP/PBD. However, 2010 saw two changes in personnel as well as changes to the departmental responsibilities of Federal Council members (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic 2008</a></span>: 1151, <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2009</a></span>: 1124; <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Kuster &amp; Widmer 2010</a></span>: 1186 and <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a>).

         <p>Moritz Leuenberger (SPS/PSS), a member of the Federal Council since 1996, announced on 9 July 2010 that he would resign at the end of the year. Federal Council member Hans‐Rudolf Merz (FDP/PLR), a member since the end of 2003, announced that he too would resign, though at the beginning of October 2010. After some discussion, it was decided that both would resign at the same time and hand over their duties at the end of October 2010. As a result of these two resignations, this meant – following the election in 2009 when resigning Federal Council member Pascal Couchepin (FDP/PLR) was replaced by Didier Burkhalter (FDP/PLR) (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Kuster &amp; Widmer 2010</a></span>: 1186–1187) – that the Federal Assembly had to hold a second replacement election during a legislative period, which was a cause for sharp critique in some quarters.
         </p>
         
         <p>To replace Leuenberger, the SPS/PSS parliamentary party nominated both Jacqueline Fehr, a member of the lower house (<i>Nationalrat</i>, National Council) representing Zurich, and Simonetta Sommaruga, a member of the upper house (<i>Ständerat</i>, Council of States) representing Bern. The FDP/PLR parliamentary party nominated Karin Keller‐Sutter, a member of the St Gallen (cantonal) executive council, as well as Johann Schneider‐Ammann, a member of the lower house representing Bern. In addition, the SVP/UDC parliamentary party sent Jean‐François Rime, a lower house member representing Fribourg, into the running, as did the parliamentary party of the GPS/PES (Green Party), which nominated Brigit Wyss, a lower house member for Solothurn.
         </p>
         
         <p>Candidates of the FDP/PLR, SPS/PSS and SVP/UDC parliamentary parties each received a relative large share of the votes. The GPS/PES candidate found little favour in the United Federal Assembly, by contrast, not least because the GPS/PES has thus far not been a governing party. Electing this candidate would mean moving from a five‐party to a six‐party Federal Council – a change not supported by a majority of the parliamentarians. In the end, Simonetta Sommaruga (SPS/PSS) and Johann Schneider‐Ammann (FDP/PLR), the two candidates regarded as the most promising already during the run up, were successful and were elected on 22 September 2010. The party political composition of the Federal Council thereby remained unchanged.</p>
         
         <p>Nevertheless, two noteworthy changes accompanied this election. First, though the canton of Bern regularly has a person representing it on the Federal Council, this election simultaneously elected two Bernese representatives. Second, with the election of an additional woman, the Federal Council received a 4:3 female majority for the first time in its history. In the aftermath of the election, some commentators speculated that Keller‐Sutter may not have stood much of a chance against Schneider‐Ammann as her election would have created a 5:2 female majority on the Federal Council.</p>
         
         <p>The Federal Council decides on its own how to distribute the cabinet departments amongst its seven members. They have traditionally been allocated based on seniority of tenure, though this time, it gave rise to discussion because two incumbents left the departments they had presided over in favour of the departments previously headed by the resigning Councillors Leuenberger and Merz. Thus, Councillor Doris Leuthard (CVP/PDC) moved from the Federal Department of Economic Affairs to the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, while Councillor Eveline Widmer‐Schlumpf moved from the Federal Department of Justice and Police to the Federal Department of Finance. The newly elected Councillor Schneider‐Ammann therefore had to become head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, and Councillor Sommaruga head of the Federal Department of Justice and Police. The change in the responsibilities of Councillor Widmer‐Schlumpf, in particular, was criticised, not just because she had only headed the Federal Department of Justice and Police since 2007, but also because it meant Councillor Sommaruga, who unlike Widmer‐Schlumpf had no training in law, had to head the Federal Department of Justice and Police. Critics insinuated that because the BDP/PDB she belonged to was in a weak position politically, Widmer‐Schlumpf was trying to ensure her re‐election in 2011 by making this change.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Changes in parliament</h2>
         
         <p>The current Federal Assembly was elected in 2007 and the next parliamentary elections will be held in 2011. Membership changes in the National Council and in the Council of States in 2010 were therefore due either to resignations or deaths. Elections to the former are by proportional representation system, so those who resign before their term of office ends are seamlessly replaced by the next unelected candidates on the party list. For that reason, the party composition of the National Council remained unchanged during 2010.</p>
         
         <p>The following three replacements took place in the National Council on 1 March 2010: Roland Rino Büchel (SVP/UDC) succeeded Jasmin Hutter, who had resigned as of the end of 2009 for family reasons; in the Lega dei Ticinesi, Norman Gobbi replaced Attilio Bignasca, who had been in office since 2003; and Paul‐Andre Roux, of the Valais CVP/PDC, took over the mandate previously held by Maurice Chevrier. There were also three replacements on 31 May 2010. Beat Jans (SPP/PSS) succeeded Rudolf Rechsteiner, who had served in the lower house since 1995. Rechsteiner withdrew from the National Council not least because his party had decided internally that it was desirable to limit the number of terms in office their representatives served. In the same party, Prisca Birrer‐Heimo replaced Hans Widmer, who had been in parliament since 1996. In the EVP/PEV (Evangelical People's Party), Maja Ingold succeeded Ruedi Aeschbacher, who had resigned for reasons of age. In this same party, Marianne Streiff‐Feller succeeded the retiring Walter Donzé on 13 September 2010. Johann Schneider‐Ammann (FDP/PLR), who had been elected Federal Councillor, was replaced in the lower house on 29 November 2010 by his party colleague Peter Flück. On that same day, Elisabeth Schneider‐Schneiter (CVP/PDC) replaced Kathrin Amacker‐Amann, who had resigned from her political post for career reasons as she had been offered an executive post at Swisscom. Jean Henri Dunant (SVP/UCD), who withdrew for health reasons, was also replaced on 29 November 2010 by Sebastian Frehner.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to these changes to personnel, which had no party political consequences, lower house representative Ricardo Lumengo, formerly of the SPS/PSS, resigned from his party as of 16 November 2010 due to ongoing legal proceedings in connection with claims he had committed electoral fraud. He has continued to be politically active in the lower house as an independent.</p>
         
         <p>There were personnel changes during 2010 in the Council of States as well. Because most elections are by majority system in this house, replacements may lead to shifts in its party political composition. State Councillor for Neuchâtel Didier Burkhalter was elected Federal Councillor in September 2009 (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Kuster &amp; Widmer 2010</a></span>: 1186–1188), and was succeeded in the upper house as of 1 March 2010 by Raphaël Comte (FDP/PLR). On the same day, Roberto Zanetti (SPS/PSS) replaced State Councillor for Solothurn Ernst Leuenberger, who had died on 30 June 2009. On 1 July 2010, Markus Stadler (GLP/PVL; Green Liberal Party) took the seat of State Councillor Hansruedi Stadler (CVP/PDC), who had resigned. Markus Stadler was, in fact, elected to the upper house as an independent, and decided to join the GLP/PVL only once successfully elected. Finally, since she had been elected Federal Councillor, Bernese State Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga resigned her seat in the upper house, effective 31 October 2010. Due to the necessity of holding an election to replace her, this seat remained vacant as of the end of 2010.
         </p>
         
         <p>In terms of the leadership in the chambers, Jean‐René Germanier (FDP/PLR) took over the presidency of the lower chamber in December 2010 from Pascale Bruderer‐Wyss (SPS/PSS), and State Councillor Hansheiri Inderkum (CVP/PDC) succeeded Erika Foster‐Vannini (FDP/PLR) as president of the upper house.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Results of national referenda and initiatives</h2>
         
         <p>The first of three national plebiscites conducted during 2010 was held on 7 March. Eligible voters were asked on that date to decide about three proposals (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Nai et al. 2010</a></span>). Electoral participation reached a mean of 45 per cent for all three proposals (see <a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink">Table 2</a>). The first proposal was to add a new article in the Constitution regarding research on human subjects. Constitutional amendments are automatically subject to a compulsory referendum, which in turn requires both a popular majority and approval by a majority of the cantons. This proposal had two concerns: the protection of human dignity and guaranteeing the freedom to conduct research. There was little controversy about it, and the proposal was broadly supported not just by the Federal Council and parliament, but also by most parties. The exceptions were the SVP/UDC and the EDU/UDF (Federal Democratic Union) – both of which rejected the proposed amendment. The GPS/PVS made no recommendations to the voters. The proposal was criticised primarily on two grounds. First, some sceptics felt this was not a constitutional issue and should instead be regulated by laws. Second, some felt stronger protection of the rights of subjects was needed or, in other words, argued for greater restriction to the freedom to conduct research. The verdict, both popular and cantonal, was unambiguous: the proposal was approved by 77.21 per cent of the voters and by all of the cantons.

         <p>The second proposal decided on that date was a popular initiative dubbed the ‘animal rights lawyers’ initiative. It called for hiring advocates of the rights of animals in the cantons and hence for a strengthening of animal welfare protection in Switzerland. Proponents of the proposal argued that it was necessary to have legal representation to ensure the rights of animals, and pointed to the positive results achieved in the canton of Zurich with such an institution. Opponents regarded the proposal as unnecessary, arguing that changes to existing animal protection laws would be sufficient to address the perceived shortcomings. They were also of the opinion that the cantons ought to themselves decide whether an animal rights lawyer was needed, and that this should not be regulated at the national level. Then there was the question of what instituting such positions would cost. Support for this initiative came from the SPS/PSS, GPS/PES, GLP/PVL and EVP/PEV parties – in other words, largely from left‐wing and ecologically oriented circles. The governing parties of the centre‐right (FDP/PLR, CVP/PDC) and populist‐right (SVP/UDC) recommended rejecting the initiative – a position that was broadly supported by the electorate. The ‘animal rights lawyers’ initiative was soundly defeated by 70.50 per cent of the votes and by all of the cantons.</p>
         
         <p>The third proposal suggested lowering the conversion rate relevant for calculating the annual old‐age occupational pension based on the constituted capital. The intent was to adjust the conversion rate to take longer life expectancy into account as this will increase the average length of time that pensions will be drawn upon. In addition, low‐risk investments were showing a sinking rate of return, which made such an adjustment appear particularly appropriate. Parliament had for that reason revised the Federal Law on Occupational Pension Schemes (BVG), and a referendum had been launched to block this change. Because this referendum was directed at a law, only a popular majority was needed and not a majority of the cantons as well. This referendum was launched by left‐wing circles (unions, SPS/PSS and GPS/PES) since they regarded this revision as unnecessary: in their view, the fiscal gap was not that large and ought to be bridged by other means. Opponents of the proposal condemned the plans to reduce the annuity as ‘pension theft’. Proponents of the referendum were able to clearly carry the day at the polls, and the proposal was rejected by 72.73 per cent of the voters. With this, a reduction in the conversion rate could, at least for the moment, be averted.</p>
         
         <p>There was a second national election/referendum on changing the Federal Compulsory Unemployment Insurance and Insolvency Compensation Law (AVIG). Here, too, only a popular majority and not a cantonal majority were needed. At only 35.84 per cent, voting participation was by Swiss standards quite low (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic &amp; Widmer 2010</a></span>). The fourth revision of the unemployment insurance law was intended to reduce the debt in this part of the social security system, as well as to place social insurance on a more solid footing for the future. On the revenue side, this was to come about through increasing payroll or wage deductions, as well as through a ‘solidarity’ contribution from those with higher incomes. On the expenditure side, benefits were to be reduced – for example, in the context of waiting periods or length of time benefits would be paid out, as well as in benefits provided to those under 25. Because these reductions were regarded as lacking in social solidarity, a committee was formed that launched a referendum against this revision. The revision was seen as too easy on those with higher incomes, and the financial situation in the unemployment compensation system not regarded as grave enough to justify such sharp reductions.
         </p>
         
         <p>The referendum was supported by the political left, particularly by the unions and by the SPS/PSS, GPS/PES, EVP/PEV and CSP/PCS (Christian Social Party) parties. Cantonal finance administrators supported it, but the Swiss League of Cities opposed it because it would raise the costs for the cities. The proponents won on election day, but only by a relatively narrow 53.42 per cent. As is often true for socio‐political referenda, there was a clear division running through the country, with the German‐speaking cantons supporting (in some cases, heavily) the proposal and the French‐speaking and Italian‐speaking cantons (along with the Basel‐City half‐canton) rejecting it.</p>
         
         <p>The last of the three national elections held in 2010 took place on 28 November 2010. It called on voters to decide about three proposals which concerned topics that had a higher potential to mobilise the electorate than the election held on 26 September 2010. Voting participation rates were high by Swiss standards, at just over 52 per cent (see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Milic &amp; Vatter 2011</a></span>). The first vote was on a popular initiative dating from 15 February 2008 calling ‘for the deportation of criminal foreigners’. This initiative had been launched by SVP/UDC and was supported by national‐conservative circles. The concern of this initiative was to ensure that foreigners who had committed certain kinds of criminal acts, or who had abused the welfare system, be automatically deported. A majority in parliament was of the view this initiative was neither in line with the Swiss Constitution, nor in accordance with Swiss commitments made under international law. As a result, it was felt that implementation of this initiative, as proposed, would create considerable problems. In addition, the list of criminal acts given in the text was found both incomplete and unsystematic. As a result of such considerations, parliament made a counter‐proposal, which as its advocates argued, addressed the substance of the initiative but did so in a manner both constitutional and consistent with international law principles. The counter‐proposal was supported by the parties of the centre and centre‐right – namely by the CVP/PDC, FDP/PLR, BDP/PBD, EVP/PEV and GLP/PVL.
         </p>
         
         <p>The political left rejected both the popular initiative and the counter‐proposal, although not consistently throughout the country in the latter case. While the GPS/PES presented a united national front, in the SPS/PSS a number of cantonal parties (in AG, BE, BL, BS, GL, NW, SZ) approved the counter‐proposal with the argument that only this could prevent the popular initiative from passing. Yet for many on the left, even the counter‐proposal went much too far and hence could not even be supported purely on pragmatic grounds. Proponents of the initiative, such as the SVP/UDC, the Lega and the EDU/UDF, recommended their supporters also turn down the counter‐proposal, but for opposite reasons. Their argument was that the issues raised in the initiative were far too watered‐down in the counter‐proposal. The campaign was heated, as is often the case for proposals that deal with foreigners. While opponents emphasised the effects proposed changes would have on constitutional and international law equal treatment principles, and denounced the ‘two‐class system of justice’ the initiative would result in, proponents of the initiative mobilised over the danger posed to domestic security – some of it with xenophobic undertones.</p>
         
         <p>Voters were faced with a ‘variants vote’, meaning they could separately accept or turn down both initiative and counter‐proposal. Should both receive majorities, a ‘tie‐break question’ was posed to determine which of the two should be implemented. In the event, since only the initiative received a majority, passing by 52.91 per cent, this question remained moot. The initiative was also approved by a majority (15 full and five half‐cantons) of the cantons. By contrast, the counter‐proposal found favour neither among the populace (54.21 per cent voted against) nor among the cantons (all of them had majorities voting against), and hence was rather clearly rejected. The tie‐break question was answered ambivalently, with a narrow popular majority favouring the counter‐proposal (50.37 per cent) but a clear cantonal majority (13 full and four half‐cantons) favouring the initiative. After a long series of defeats, for the first time a popular initiative concerning foreigners was accepted.</p>
         
         <p>The last proposal on the ballot of 28 November 2010 was a popular initiative (from 6 May 2008) ‘for fair taxes: stop the abuse of tax competition’. This tax justice initiative was launched by the left‐wing SPS/PSS and was supported by the (centre‐)left GPS/PES, CSP/PCS und EVP/PEV parties. This initiative had originally come about in response to a degressive tax that the canton of Obwalden had introduced, which was subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court. In addition to prohibiting degressive tax rates (what the court decision had virtually introduced), the tax justice initiative called for marginal tax rates for income and wealth taxes. The intent was to mitigate inter‐cantonal tax rate competition. Opponents of the initiative included parties of the centre and the right (SVP/UDC, FDP/PLR, CVP/PDC, Lega, BDP/PBD, GLP/PVL and EDU/UDF) along with the cantonal finance administrators, who saw in this initiative an impermissible intrusion into the tax sovereignty of the cantons and hence also of economic development.</p>
         
         <p>During the election campaign, the tax justice initiative was long ignored and was overshadowed by the debates over the ‘criminal foreigners’. Toward the end of the campaign, and due to opinion poll results showing increasing approval, this initiative began to receive more attention, particularly among its opponents. In the media particular attention was paid to threats uttered by individual entrepreneurs, who threatened to pull their production or companies entirely out of Switzerland should the initiative be approved. The result, both popular (58.46 per cent) and cantonal (17 full and five half‐cantons), was relatively clearly in opposition to the initiative. Only the cantons of Geneva, Jura, Neuchâtel and the half‐canton Basel‐City approved the initiative at the polls.</p>
