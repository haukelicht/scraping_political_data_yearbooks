         <p>The year 2014 was a difficult one for the government and citizens in Australian federal politics. Although the Liberal‐National coalition had won a landslide election late in 2013, the honeymoon period was short, with public support for both the government and the Prime Minister plummeting during 2014. The government's policy direction was well‐received initially, but the economic outlook was grim and the government's austere budget proposals were thwarted by a hostile Senate and read by voters to be inherently unfair. As a result, by the end of 2014, Prime Minister Abbott was facing low ratings in the polls and increasing discontent among his party colleagues.</p>

            <p>In 2014 there was no federal election, but a re‐election for the six Senate seats in Western Australia was required after 1,370 ballot papers were lost in advance of an official recount in November 2013 to establish the last two Senate places. The closeness of the result was in part triggered by a minor party alliance that had been established in advance of the 2013 election, with minor and micro parties trading preferences with each other, across the left‐right spectrum, thereby ‘gaming’ the single transferable vote (STV) electoral system. The strategy led to the unlikely result of Labor's second Senator being defeated by a micro party candidate, despite Labor polling 1.86 quotas (26.6 per cent of the vote) and the micro party receiving 0.016 quotas (0.23 per cent of the vote) (Bean &amp; McAllister <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>Ultimately, because of the missing ballots, the Australian Electoral Commission referred the count to the Court of Disputed Returns, which ordered that a second election for the Western Australian Senate take place on 5 April 2014. In this special election, the Liberals retained three seats, Labor was unable to win a second seat, and the Greens and the Palmer United Party won the remaining two (Bean &amp; McAllister <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). The new Senators’ six‐year terms began on 1 July 2014, with 12 new Senators taking up positions alongside the 64 who returned. With them came a major shift in the dynamics of the federal parliament, where the government of the day seldom wins a majority in the Senate. From July, the power to alter or obstruct the Abbott government's legislative agenda passed from the Greens to a diverse group of right‐of‐centre micro parties and independents (Mackerras <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>).

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> State elections</h3>
            
            <p>There were three state‐level elections during 2014, two of which resulted in a change of government. The Tasmanian state election of 15 March produced a change of government, with the four‐term Labor government soundly defeated by the Liberals, who won 15 of the 25 seats in the lower House of Assembly. The South Australian election, held on the same day, was a much tighter race. The result was a hung parliament, with Labor forming a government with the support of two cross‐benchers. Labor won a by‐election later in the year that enabled them to achieve majority government. In Victoria, the incumbent Liberal‐National coalition government was defeated after only one term in office. In addition, the Greens won two lower house seats – the first time they had won representation to the Victorian Legislative Assembly.</p>

         <p>Throughout 2014, Prime Minister Abbott experienced declining popularity as leader and there was some uncertainty among Liberal backbenchers and in the media about the government's poor performance in the polls. Partly in an effort to refocus the government's policy agenda, and partly as a result of the resignation of the Assistant Treasurer, Prime Minister Abbott announced a Cabinet reshuffle on 20 December 2014. The changes led to one minister being sacked, primarily because of ill‐disciplined comments that led the public to question the government's defence procurement processes. The controversial immigration minister (Scott Morrison) was moved to Social Services, which was perceived by some in the media to suggest that the government was looking to implement further changes to welfare services and expenditure. Sussan Ley, formerly an associate minister outside of cabinet, was promoted to Minister for Health, reportedly as a reward for her good performances in parliament and in the media. Her appointment doubled the number of women in cabinet. She was immediately required to front the government's back‐tracking on a controversial increase in the cost of doctors’ visits.</p>

         <p>Apart from the Senate changeover on 1 July 2014 (when the number of female Senators increased by one), the composition of parliament remained stable over the course of 2014. There was one by‐election held on 8 February 2014 for the seat vacated by former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who had announced his intention to resign in November 2013. Rudd's seat of Griffith was retained by Labor's Terri Butler with 51.8 per cent of the vote, marginally increasing the proportion of women in the House of Representatives, from 25.3 to 26 per cent.</p>

         <p>There were no formal institutional changes made during 2014, although two separate parliamentary committee inquiries resulted in recommendations that may lead to key institutional changes in the future. The Joint Select Committee Inquiry into the 2013 federal election investigated a number of aspects of the election and was scathing in its assessment of the Australian Electoral Commission's management and security of ballot papers. In addition to recommending a series of procedural changes regarding ballot papers in its final report (tabled in April 2015), the committee released several interim reports during 2014 (JSCEM <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>One report included a set of six recommendations for reform to the Senate voting system to address the issue of preference harvesting, excessively large ballot papers and the requirement for compulsory preferential voting ‘below the line’. This line on Senate ballots separates parties (above the line) from candidates (below it). Voters have the option of selecting one party above the line or of ranking candidates below the line to direct the flow of preferences. Under existing legislation, if voting below the line, all candidates must be given a preference to make the vote formal or it is not counted. Specifically, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918 be amended to allow for optional preferential voting above the line, partial optional preferential voting below the line and the abolition of group voting tickets. The goal of these recommendations is to provide voters with full control over the distribution of preferences and closely reflect the provisions outlined in Senator Nick Xenophon's bill introduced in November 2013. The aim of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Above the Line Voting) Bill 2013 is also to remove Group Voting Tickets and introduce optional preferential voting above and below the line for Senate ballot papers. Xenophon's bill has passed two readings in the Senate, with further progress dependent on the government's response to the Committee's final report, due at the end of 2015.</p>

         <p>A second Joint Select Committee dedicated to the issue of constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples was established to inquire into and report on the requirements for a successful referendum on indigenous constitutional recognition. The Committee's final recommendation in September 2014 was that a referendum should be held no later than the federal election in 2016 (JSCCRATSIP <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>). Prime Minister Abbott responded at the end of 2014 with a statement declaring that, despite his commitment to constitutional recognition of Australia's indigenous peoples, his preference was to wait until 2017 (ABC <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>).

         <p>There were no internal changes within the major parties at the federal level in 2014, although early in 2015 Prime Minister Abbott faced a caucus‐initiated no‐confidence vote, with an implicit challenge to his leadership reported as coming from the Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull. Abbott survived, winning 61 votes to 39. In the Senate, Jacqui Lambie and Glenn Lazarus, originally elected on the Palmer United Party ticket, and John Madigan of the Democratic Labor Party, left their respective parties and moved to the cross‐benches as independents.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12075-sec-0080-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>A critical issue for the Abbott government throughout 2014 was its declining popularity and its inability to gain Senate support for key policy reforms. By December 2014, after only 15 months in office, the Liberal‐National coalition had gone from winning a landslide election to being ten points behind the opposition in the polls.</p>
         
         <p>The government did achieve some policy wins in 2014 – namely free trade deals with China, Korea and Japan, the implementation of Operation Sovereign Borders to stop the arrival of asylum seekers by boat, and the repeal of the mining and carbon taxes. However, the economic climate was grim, with a slump in commodity prices, unemployment at 6 per cent (an 11‐year high) and no surplus likely in the coming decade. The government presented an austere budget in May 2014, which included a range of what were to become unpopular measures. Specifically, the pension age was raised to 70, university fees were de‐regulated, substantial budget and personnel cuts were made to the publicly funded television stations, state‐funding for schools was cut as were unemployment benefits, and a minimum fee for doctors’ visits was planned.</p>
         
         <p>A number of these proposals were contrary to the government's pre‐election promises, but they were also labelled ‘regressive’ by a number of independent agencies, economists and Treasury officials, with a disproportionate impact expected on low and middle income households (Allard &amp; Martin <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>; Colebatch <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>; Griffiths <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>). Two months after the budget, <i>The Australian</i>'s Newspoll showed the government's support remained close to the lowest levels since Tony Abbott became Liberal leader in 2009, with support for the opposition Labor party at 54 per cent compared to 46 per cent for the Liberal‐National Government (Hudson <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>; Scott <span><a href="#epdy12075-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12075-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>). By the end of 2014, Abbott had been unable to pass key parts of his budget through the Senate and his government had failed to reverse its low poll support. The result was an escalation in the number of Liberal members of parliament expressing disquiet with Abbott's leadership in the public domain, culminating in a party ballot on Abbott's leadership in February 2015. Abbott's ministers remained loyal and he won sufficient support to retain the prime ministership. However, the 61–39 result was less than convincing, and 2015 may prove to be another difficult year for Abbott and his government.
