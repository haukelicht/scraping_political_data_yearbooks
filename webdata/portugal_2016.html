         <p>The new socialist minority government of Antonio Costa was under considerable pressure from the European Commission to deliver on promises to reduce the budget deficit. This was the main issue throughout the year. Early in the year presidential elections led to the victory of a university law professor Marcelo Rebelo Sousa. Moreover, elections in the autonomous region of the Azores took place in October.</p>

            <p>The campaign for the presidential elections took place during January. There were ten official candidates, among them several that were independent from political parties. In Portugal, presidential elections take place every five years. Candidates have to achieve more than 50 per cent of the vote to be elected, otherwise a second round of the two most popular takes place.</p>
            
            <p>According to the opinion polls the frontrunner was a law professor Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, based at the University of Lisbon, who was also a prominent political commentator. Rebelo de Sousa had not only a vast academic knowledge of the Portuguese political system, but he also had been one of the not‐so‐successful leaders of the Social Democratic Party (<i>Partido Social Democrata –</i> PSD) between 1996 and 1998. Politically, he was supported by the PSD, the Democratic Social Centre‐People's Party (<i>Centro Democratico Social‐Partido Popular –</i> CDS‐PP) and People's Monarchic Party (<i>Partido Popular Monárquico</i> – PPM). In most opinion polls, his electoral advantage was between 30 and 40 points to his nearest rival António Sampaio de Nóvoa, an almost unknown former rector of the University of Lisbon. Unfortunately for Sampaio de Nóvoa, the Socialist Party decided to support both him and the well‐known former minister for Equality and Health Maria de Belém. This led to a split of the socialist vote. After Rebelo de Sousa and Sampaio de Nóvoa, opinion polls put the relatively young Marisa Matias, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), in third place. She was supported by her radical left party, Block of the Left (<i>Bloco da Esquerda –</i> BE). The communist candidate Edgar Silva would just become fourth according to the opinion polls. He was also rather unknown among the population. Other candidates were also virtually unknown and came from wider civil society.

            <p>On 16 October 2016, elections took place in the autonomous region of Azores which until then was governed by an absolute majority government of the Socialist Party under the leadership of President Vasco Cordeiro. Although it was a regional election, it also acted as a first major electoral test for the Costa central government. In spite of minor losses, PS was able to win the election with 49 per cent (–2.6 per cent) and 30 seats (–1 seat in relation to 2012) and be re‐confirmed in office with an absolute majority. The main opposition party, the PSD, got 33 per cent (–2.1 per cent) and 19 seats (–1 seat). The big winners were several smaller parties. The conservative CDS‐PP got 7.2 per cent (+1.6) and 4 seats (+1), the radical left BE 3.7 per cent (+1.4) and 2 seats (+1), the Communist Democratic Unity Coalition (<i>Coligação Democrática Unitária –</i> CDU) 2.6 per cent (+0.7) and 1 seat (0) and the Monarchist PPM 0.9 per cent (+0.8) and 1 seat (0).

         <p>The new socialist minority government of António Costa showed a high level of stability and cohesion throughout the year. Just one reshuffling took place in April, caused by the Minister of Culture João Soares reacting badly to articles of two newspaper columnists Augusto M. Seabra and Vasco Pulido Valente which criticised his work in office. He reacted on his Facebook page with the threat to give both of them a couple of slaps for stating their negative opinion about him. Prime Minister Antonio Costa forced him to apologise for his misplaced threat. In the end, Soares apologised half‐heartedly and resigned. Therefore, Prime Minister Costa had to replace him with Ambassador Luis Felipe Castro Mendes, who was the Portuguese representative at the Council of Europe, as the new culture minister.</p>
         
         <p>In August 2016, there were also calls to dismiss Fernando Rocha Andrade, the Secretary of State for Fiscal Affairs, and other three junior ministers because they got free tickets and travel from the major Portuguese oil company GALP for the Euro 2016 football final between France and Portugal. Prime Minister Costa announced an investigation on the issue which led to the creation of a code of conduct, but no consequences for Andrade, other than that he was asked to re‐pay the travel and ticket costs.</p>

         <p>During 2016, the socialist government could rely on a solid parliamentary majority with the support of the two radical left parties, the Block of the Left and the Communists. With their support, the government could get their late budget in 2016 and that of 2017 approved. The two opposition parties remained the Social Democrats and the Democratic Social Centre Party. One major committee of inquiry on the recapitalisation of the main public bank <i>Caixa Geral de Depósitons</i> (CGD) was set up on 27 July, but it had not completed its work at the end of the year.
         </p>
         
         <p>Moreover, parliament approved a bill to reduce by 10 per cent the public subsidies to political parties. There were also calls from the radical left parties to cut other tax privileges related to real estate owned by the political parties. The bill was approved with the votes of the PSD, CDS‐PP, the Communists and the Block of Left, while the Party of Animals and Nature (<i>Partido dos Animais e Natureza –</i> PAN) voted against it. The ruling socialists abstained. In this respect, one should mention the high debt of the Portuguese political parties, in spite of considerably generous public funding. At the end of 2015, it reached €36 million, of which the incumbent governing socialist party owed about €22 million (61 per cent of the sum) and the PSD €9 million (25 per cent) (Entidades de Contas <span title=""><a href="#epdy12167-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12167-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>; Expresso, 2 September 2016; Radio Renascença 2 September 2016).

         <p>After the general elections of 4 October 2015, several parties represented in parliament had their party conferences. However, just the conservative CDS‐PP changed its leadership from the charismatic former vice‐prime minister Paulo Portas, who decided to retire from politics, to the former Minister for Agriculture and Sea Assunção Cristas. On 12–13 March, at the 26<sup>th</sup> party conference of Gondomar Cristas was elected by 96 per cent of 1,100 delegates to be the new leader of the party. On 1–3 April 2016, the 36<sup>th</sup> party conference of the PSD took place in Espinho, with Pedro Passos Coelho remaining as uncontested leader. On 25–26 June, the Block of the Left had its 10<sup>th</sup> party convention in Lisbon and 83 per cent of the 535 delegates confirmed Catarina Martins as their leader. The Communist Party held its 20<sup>th</sup> party conference in its electoral stronghold of Almada on 2–4 December 2016. The delegates also reconfirmed Jerónimo de Sousa as their leader.

            <p>Prime Minister António Costa was very keen to show that his government could keep the commitments of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) related to the Maastricht criteria (keeping the budget deficit below 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and public debt at 60 per cent of GDP) without the level of austerity policies of his predecessor Pedro Passos Coelho. However, the big difference is that the former prime minister had to deal with a very intrusive ‘Troika’ and therefore had no real choice but to do so, while Costa was already operating in the post‐Troika period. Nevertheless, Portugal remained still under quite considerable monitoring by the Eurogroup and the European Commission through the corrective arm of the new economic governance system. In March 2016, it became known that the budget deficit of 2015 was 4.2 per cent of GDP, mainly due to the bailout of the ailing <i>Banco Internacional do Funchal</i> (BANIF) in late December 2015.
            </p>
            
            <p>Costa's main ally was Finance Minister Mario Centeno, who took centre stage in Portuguese politics throughout the year. Apart from the constant pressure from the European institutions, he had to: survive the inquisition by the European Commission and the Eurogroup under chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem; constant criticisms from German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble; prevent any kind of penalties due to the budget deficit; and draft belatedly the budget for 2016 (passed in March with the votes of PS, BE and the Communists). Moreover, he had also to negotiate with the European Commission and European Central Bank a recapitalisation of the main public bank CGD.</p>
            
            <p>After May 2016 the main issue for the European Commission and the Eurogroup was how to deal with the excessive budget deficit incurred in 2015. Normally, this was in breach of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) agreed with the European institutions, which envisaged a figure below 3 per cent of GDP. After skilful negotiations of the Portuguese government and the very consensual approach of President Jean‐Claude Juncker no penalties were issued, which normally could be up to 0.2 per cent of GDP. One important supporter of the Portuguese government was Carlos Moedas, the Portuguese representative in the European Commission who pleaded for a soft approach towards the country, after their successful implementation of the Troika programme and the level of austerity policies that the population had suffered. Moedas had been the main liaison person during the period of the Troika and had a considerable reputation in the European institutions.</p>
            
            <p>On 15 October 2016, Finance Minister Centeno submitted the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission which after some adjustments was accepted. In the context of budgetary constraint, Costa and Centeno were very keen to reduce further the budget deficit to 1.4 per cent. Therefore, just a modest increase for pensioners of €10 was included in the budget, and the partial abolition of an additional tax (<i>sobretaxa</i>) applied to income to large parts of the population introduced during the Troika period. On 29 November, the new budget was again approved in parliament with the votes of the socialists, BE, communists and PAN, with the PSD and CDS‐PP voting against.
            </p>
            
            <p>Throughout the year Centeno was able to keep a strict discipline in terms of implementing the budget without incurring too much deficit. However, in June the European Commission changed the deficit target from 2.7 to 2.5 per cent. According to the original budget, Finance Minister Centeno hoped to achieve 2.2 per cent. At the end of the year, it was estimated that the budget deficit would be about 2.4 per cent, which was certainly a pre‐condition to leave the excessive deficit procedure and regain some more autonomy over the budget.</p>

            <p>Portugal's publicly owned CGD was incurring quite considerable losses before, during and after the finance and sovereign debt crisis. Main reasons for this were wrong strategic business choices and an excessive international expansion. Finance Minister Mário Centeno's task was to get approval from the European Commission and European Central Bank to recapitalize the bank. Due to the fact that the Portuguese state was the sole owner this was a major question for competition law, because other private banks may be then disadvantaged in this respect. At the end of August a compromise was achieved between the government and the European Commission which allowed for a partial bailout by the government as well as raising funds by the bank in the markets. It was agreed that the Portuguese government could offer a bailout of €2.7 billion, CGD would get €900 million own capital from Contingent Convertible Bonds (so‐called CoCos) and seek funding through bank bonds of up to €1 billion in the markets. However, the Costa government decided to postpone the re‐capitalization of CGD to <span title=""><a href="#epdy12167-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12167-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span> in order not to burden the 2016 budget.

            <p>More problematic for the government was the sale of Banco Novo, the former Banco Espirito Santo, which collapsed in July 2014. A first attempt was made in December 2015, but none of the offers were close to the predicted return of the bailout sum of € 3.9 billion provided by the government and other banks of the Portuguese financial system in 2014. In July 2016, Antonio Costa, after negotiation with the European Central Bank, stated the intention to resolve the sale of the bank by August 2017. This would give time for the Bank of Portugal to prepare for the sale. In early November 2016, five offers were submitted. At the end of the year no decision had been made; the US American hedge fund Lone Star seemed to be the frontrunner but its offer of €750 million was quite far from the intended recuperation of the bailout sum of €3.9 billion undertaken by the government and other Portuguese banks in 2014.</p>

            <p>The Costa government was also able to get agreement with the social partners on raising the minimum wage from €530 to €557. The tripartite agreement included a concession to employers that their social costs would be reduced by 1.25 per cent (normally 23.5 per cent of gross wages) for workers that earned that amount in the last three months of 2016. All social partners signed the agreement, apart from the communist trade union the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (<i>Confederação Geral de Trabalhadores Portugueses –</i>CGTP). The reduction of the TSU (<i>Taxa Social Única</i>) for employers was opposed by the radical left‐wing parties BE and PCP, but also by the conservative PSD (Perista et al. <span title=""><a href="#epdy12167-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12167-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). This was the second increase after it had been raised from €505 to €530 in 2016.
            </p>
            
            <p>The social partners also agreed on revitalising collective bargaining, particularly the procedures of extension to non‐unionised workers, combating excessive labour market segmentation and re‐assessing the unemployment benefit system (Perista et al. <span title=""><a href="#epdy12167-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12167-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). The cooperative behaviour of the government contributed to a better climate in industrial relations and to the decline of unemployment to 10.5 per cent, but at a cost of increased precariousness in the labour market in the last quarter of 2016.
