         <p>The Eerste Kamer (upper chamber or senate) was elected on 23 May by the provincial councilors who had been elected by the people on 2 March 2011. Provincial issues played a modest role in the provincial elections; most voters followed their national party preferences – even more than usual, according to exit polls. For the minority government formed in 2010 (see Lucardie &amp; Voerman <span><a href="#epdy24-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy24-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>), the elections were not only a first test of their popularity, but also the only way to win majority support in the upper house where the Christian Democrats and Liberals held only 35 out of 75 seats. Left‐wing opposition parties tried to form a common front against the government, but failed to overcome their disagreements. As a result of the polarised and nationalised nature of the provincial elections, turnout was higher than usual at 56 per cent (compared to 46 per cent in 2007).
         </p>
         
         <p>The results resembled the outcome of the parliamentary elections of 2010: the Christian Democratic Appeal (Christen‐Democratisch Appel, CDA) lost about half of its seats, while the left‐wing and right‐wing liberal parties Democrats 66 (Democraten 66, D66) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie, VVD) made substantial gains (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy24-tbl-0001">1</a>). The VVD became the largest party in the upper house – a position it had also held in the lower house since 2010. The nationalist and populist Freedom Party (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV), which supported the government and had not taken part in the previous provincial elections, obtained seats in all 12 provinces and became the largest party in Limburg – the southern province where its founder, Geert Wilders, was born. Yet its share of the popular vote had decreased since 2010 from 17 to 12 per cent. With 37 seats even VVD, CDA and PVV together failed to win a majority in the upper house. They could count on the support of the Calvinist Political Reformed Party (Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij, SGP), however. The government had already shown a certain willingness to meet the demands of this party, restricting the number of Sundays when shops could stay open and maintaining the prohibition of blasphemy in public. In April, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Piet Hein Donner (CDA), said he would not take any action against the SGP, which still refused to nominate women for public office – in spite of a decision of the Supreme Court. The SGP agreed with the government in many other areas anyway.

         <p>Like the Christian Democrats, the SGP as well as the Christian Union (ChristenUnie) had lost seats in the upper house. Secularisation (i.e., declining church affiliation and church attendance) seems the obvious explanation for the losses by all three religious parties. Another loser was the left‐wing Socialist Party (Socialistische Partij, SP), which won eight seats in 2007, but had to give up four of those now. The GreenLeft (GroenLinks, GL) won one seat. The largest opposition party, the Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid, PvdA) did not gain or lose any seats. All in all, neither the government parties nor the left‐wing opposition could claim a clear victory.</p>
         
         <p>Some provincial parties lost seats, but their alliance, the Independent Senate Group (Onafhankelijke Senaatsfractie, OSF), held on to its seat. The new senior citizens' party Fifty Plus (50plus) won nine seats in eight provinces and could also claim a seat in the Senate. Its founder, Jan Nagel, returned to the upper house where he had represented the PvdA from 1977 to 1983. He played a role in movements to renew the PvdA, but gave up in the 1990s and founded the party Liveable Netherlands (Leefbaar Nederland) in 1999. After the short‐lived success of this populist party, which won two seats at the 2002 parliamentary elections but lost them again in 2003, he made three more attempts to set up a new party. The third attempt was Fifty Plus.</p>

            <p>The minority government depended on the PVV for support, but the latter had made it clear from the start that its support would be restricted to the topics about which it had reached agreement in 2010 (see Lucardie &amp; Voerman <span><a href="#epdy24-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy24-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 1075). Frequently the government had to negotiate with other parties. In January it reached an agreement with D66, GreenLeft and the Christian Union to send about 500 Dutch policemen to Kunduz, a province in northern Afghanistan, to train local policemen. The PVV objected to this mission. So did the PvdA and SP. It was a sensitive issue, as the military mission in Afghanistan had led to the fall of the preceding cabinet. The GreenLeft and D66 agreed only under the condition that the new mission would be civilian rather than military, even if some military protection was deemed necessary.

            <p>The government also discussed several institutional reforms with the opposition parties. It wanted to reduce the size of both the lower and the upper houses of parliament (from 150 to 100 seats and from 75 to 50 seats, respectively) and reduce the number of provinces. Moreover, a reform of the district water boards (‘<i>waterschappen</i>’) and the power of the monarch were discussed (the latter not on the initiative of the government). No agreement was reached and none of these plans were implemented, however.

            <p>The government presented a bill about party funding in April. It specified the conditions for state subsidies – nothing new here – as well as for donations to political parties. Parties would have to register all donations over €1,000 and publish names and residences of companies, organisations or individuals spending more than €4,500. Failure to do so might be punished with a fine of €25,000 and suspension of state subsidies. The bill provoked the anger of the PVV, which did not receive state subsidies and depended on (anonymous) donations. Its spokesman announced that the party would rather pay the fine than obey the law, if it were enacted. Discussion of the bill was deferred to 2012.</p>

            <p>In June 2011 the government reached an agreement with employers and unions – after long and difficult negotiations – to increase both the pension and the retirement age gradually to 67 years (by 2025). The unions were extremely divided on the agreement, with a large minority rejecting the plans. The left‐wing opposition parties PvdA and SP, both close to the unions, were also critical of the agreement. Since the minority government could not rely on the support of the PVV in this case, it tried to negotiate a deal with the PvdA. After the cabinet had agreed that people with a low income and a small pension would be able to retire in 2025 without a major discount on their state pension, the PvdA decided to support the agreement.</p>

            <p>On the European summit of 21 July 2011, the Heads of Governments of the eurozone countries announced a second emergency loan of €109 billion for Greece. Because of its large budget deficit and huge debts, Greece was seen as a serious threat to the stability of the euro. In The Hague, the minority cabinet could not count on the support of the PVV in this case. Tensions within the coalition had already increased before the summit, when Wilders accused Prime Minister Rutte of squandering the interests of the Netherlands. He rejected every loan to Athens. The left‐wing opposition parties PvdA, D66 and Green Left supported the government, however.</p>
            
            <p>At the European Summit of 8–9 December 2011 it was agreed that the budgetary rules in the Stability and Growth Pact had to become more strict; a new treaty would be signed for this purpose. Sanctions could be imposed almost automatically on countries that failed to comply with the stricter budget rules. This was in line with the position of the Dutch government. Coalition parties CDA and VVD were satisfied, but the PVV turned the plans down. The pro‐European PvdA, D66 and GreenLeft were disappointed because the plans did not go far enough in their opinion. Besides, GreenLeft regretted that the European Parliament had not played a role in the process. Eventually, the PvdA and D66 helped the government to a majority in parliament.</p>

            <p>As a result of the credit crisis, in the fall of 2008 several Dutch banks were facing serious problems. Therefore the Dutch government felt obliged to render financial assistance, amounting to tens of billions of euros. The government often had to operate without being able to inform the parliament fully because of lack of time or the information being too sensitive. To gain more insight into what exactly had happened, the lower house decided to start a parliamentary inquiry into the way the Dutch government had managed the financial crisis in the period September 2008–January 2009. In November 2011 the inquiry committee started its hearings (in which it examined officials under oath).The committee's report was scheduled for March 2012.</p>
            
            <p>The upper house decided in March 2011 to set up a parliamentary investigation (without oath‐taking) into the social consequences of privatisation of former state companies such as Dutch Post and Telecom (KPN) and Dutch Railways (NS), and into the parliamentary decision‐making process in this area. In November 2011 the investigation committee started its activities; its report is expected in September 2012. It was the first time that the upper house held a parliamentary investigation.</p>

            <p>On 16 December the Minister of Home Affairs and Relations with the Dutch Antilles, Piet Hein Donner (CDA), was appointed Vice‐Chairman of the Council of State (a body which advises government and the parliament on legislation and governance and serves as court of appeal in legal conflicts between citizens and the state). Queen Beatrix is the President of the Council, but the Vice‐President is the operational head of the Council; his nickname is ‘viceroy of the Netherlands’. Donner succeeded Herman Tjeenk Willink (PvdA), who was appointed in 1997. Donner's appointment was controversial: some opposition parties found it undesirable that he should issue advice on laws he had prepared himself. As Minister, Donner was succeeded by Liesbeth Spies (CDA).</p>
