         <p>The year 2017 was expected to be a relatively quiet one. Despite the country's relatively buoyant economic performance that year, the government had been under pressure from three sides: Catalan separatism, corruption allegations and the durability of the country's economic recovery. The Catalan regional parliament, led by Carles Puigdemont, of the pro‐independence Democratic Party of Catalonia (PDeCAT), called a referendum on 1 October. The Mariano Rajoy government refused to recognize the legitimacy of any plebiscite, given the fact that it contravened the Constitution. The Catalan crisis has pushed the country to the worst political crisis in 40 years of democracy.</p>

            <p>The 12th regional elections in Catalonia on 21 December were convoked by the national government based on Article 155 of the Constitution in order to restore constitutional legitimacy in that region after the unconstitutional declaration of independence approved by the government and some of the regional deputies.</p>
            
            <p>These elections had several features: a high turnout (79.1 per cent) and the electoral and parliamentary victory of a non independentist party (Ciudadanos) with 26 per cent of the vote. In this election, the PDeCat – with its new acronym, Junts per Cat (JxCat) – participated separately from the independentist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC). The ex‐president of the Catalan government (Generalitat), a fugitive from justice in Belgium, headed the list of JxCat that received 22 per cent of the votes. The ex‐vice‐president and ex‐regional Minister of Economy of the Generalitat, Oriol Junqueras, in prison since October, headed the list of the ERC that received 23.7 per cent of the votes. Independence support continued to be strongly rooted in rural constituencies and in the electoral districts of Girona and Lleida, where they obtained 64 per cent and 69 per cent of the votes compared with the 54 per cent and the 56 per cent of the vote obtained in Barcelona and Tarragona districts respectively.</p>

         <p>In a context of weak and unstable support for the majority of the government, Parliament approved only 13 laws. One was the budget law. For this, government could rely on the minimum parliamentary majority of 176 votes with the support of Ciudadanos (C's), the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and several minority parties: the Navarrese People's Union (UPN), the Asturias Forum (Foro), the Canarian Coalition (CC) and New Canary (NC).</p>
         
         <p>Some national institutions needed to be replaced by Parliament because their terms in office were finished in 2015. The term of the Ombudsman (Defensor del Pueblo) ended in July. The First Deputy, Francisco Miguel Fernández Marugán, holds the position of acting Ombudsman until he is appointed the new Ombudsman. The members of the Administration Council of the Spanish Radio Television (Consejo de Administración de Radio Television Española) continued their functions because there was no agreement in Parliament to replace it. Only the Central Electoral Board (Junta Electoral Central) was replaced due to the agreement reached between the four main parliamentary groups.</p>
         
         <p>In May, the coalition United We Can/Unidos Podemos submitted a motion of no confidence against the government of Rajoy. The debate was held between 13 and 14 June. The results were: 170 votes against (People's Party (PP), Ciudadanos, UPN, Foro and CC), 82 in favour (Unidos Podemos, Confluencias, ERC and Euskal Herria Bildu (EHB)) and 97 abstentions (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), PDeCat, PNV and Nueva Canarias).</p>
         
         <p>For the first time it was necessary in Spain to apply Article 155 of the Constitution. It revokes the Catalonian government and Catalonia's status as an autonomous region, bringing it under direct control of the central government in Madrid to protect the general interest of the citizens of Catalonia. In other words, to respect the 1978 Constitution, which guarantees the ‘indissoluble unity’ of the Spanish nation, and only recognize regions’ ‘right to autonomy’ and not a right to self‐determination.</p>

         <p>In February, three main parliamentary parties held their national congress. The Popular Party held its 18th National Congress. It ratified Rajoy as the party's president and there were no significant changes in its structure. Only the position of the general coordinator was created; it fell into the hands of Fernando Martínez Maillo. On the first day of the congress, a sentence of 13 years of imprisonment was announced for the three ‘ringleaders’ of the Gürtel corruption plot. In its congress, Ciudadanos decided to change its ideology: it substituted social democracy with progressive liberalism. Meanwhile, Podemos undertook a structure and internal party organizational change, making it more hierarchical and centralized.</p>
         
         <p>On 21 May, the PSOE held primaries to elect its Secretary‐General (Secretario General). The census was composed of 187,782 members (PSOE <span><a href="#epdy12209-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12209-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). The turnout was 79.8 per cent. The former Secretary‐General Pedro Sanchez, who refused to allow the investiture of Rajoy by abstaining, won with 50.3 per cent of the votes (74,805 members); the president of the Andalusian government, Susana Díaz, who represented the regional party leaders and was in favour of facilitating Rajoy's investiture, obtained 39.9 per cent of the votes (59,392); and Patxi López, who presented himself as an intermediate and conciliatory path between the two favourite candidates, received 9.8 per cent of the votes (14,652 members). The new party leadership began, as soon as it was appointed, to work on the reform of the party's statutes.

         <p>Spain's minority government has been altered since October 2016. Despite the country's relatively buoyant economic performance this year, the government has been under pressure from three sides: Catalan separatism, corruption allegations and the durability of its economic recovery. Spain has registered steady economic growth since the depths of the financial and Eurozone crises. The country has implemented a number of reforms, demonstrating a flexibility less obvious in its other neighbours in Southern Europe. The austerity measures taken by Rajoy's government have had positive results: Spain's economy registered four consecutive quarters of growth during 2017, exceeding International Monetary Fund's (IMF) expectations. Spain has been the Eurozone's fastest growing economy. This optimistic scenario was tempered by the unemployment rate. Although it dropped, this improvement was mainly due to temporary jobs, encouraged by the PP's labour market reforms.</p>
         
         <p>Rajoy's government was affected by corruption scandals that plagued the PP. Rajoy testified in court on 26 July and denied any knowledge of corruption in his party. But the most serious problem Rajoy's government had to deal with was the independence referendum in Catalonia. The Catalonian pro‐independence majority government staged a unilateral referendum on separating from Spain. The referendum, held on 1 October, was legally flawed even in its own terms and conceived without proper Catalan Parliamentary debate. In the brief campaign, Puigdemont failed to explain how independence would come about, falsely suggesting that Catalonia could swiftly become a member of the European Union. That idea had been rejected in Brussels.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the central government's formal notice to the Catalan government to restore the constitutional order following the illegal 1 October referendum, the separatist majority of the Junts pel Sí (JxSI) and the Candidatura de Unión Popular (CUP), which had 72 seats in the Catalan Parliament, adopted a resolution restating the project for a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) at its plenary session on 27 October. This was rejected by at least 10 of the 11 MPs of the Catalan branch of Podemos, while the 52 MPs of the Unionist bloc comprising C's, the Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC) and the People's Party of Catalonia (PPC) had left the chamber. Finally, Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence from Spain. The document called for Catalonia to be recognized as an ‘independent and sovereign state’. The referendum was declared invalid by Spain's Constitutional Court.</p>
         
         <p>After the address to the nation by King Felipe VI and a massive demonstration in Catalonia, the Spanish Parliament granted Rajoy unprecedented powers to impose direct rule on Catalonia under Article 155 of the Constitution. Although holding a senate majority, the Spanish Prime Minister preferred to obtain the support of the socialists by undertaking to support the constitutional reform for a new territorial and financing model for the regions and to minimize as far as possible the length of the central government's intervention at the head of the Catalan Generalitat. The government also received the support of Ciudadanos for this purpose. In fact, Article 155, which had never been used previously, allowed Rajoy to take control of Catalonia's civil service, police, finances and public media. Rajoy was allowed to dissolve the Catalan Parliament and call for new elections on 21 December (see Election report). The Spanish government had international support from the European Union, the UK, Germany and the United States, which all said they would not recognize Catalan independence and they expressed support for Rajoy to preserve Spanish unity. The impact of this political crisis has had a huge impact on the economy. Nearly 2000 businesses moved their headquarters out of Barcelona.</p>
         
         <p>Catalan President Puigdemont escaped to Belgium, seeking protection after being accused of sedition and rebellion. Two of his ex‐ministers are in prison in Spain.</p>
