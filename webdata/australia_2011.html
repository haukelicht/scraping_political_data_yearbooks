         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy1-sec-0002-title"> Federal parliament in 2011</h2>
         
         <p>This article considers the major events in their order of importance as assessed by me. There were certain identical characteristics between 1 January 2011 and 2012. The Prime Minister and leader of the Labor Party was Julia Gillard. The Leader of the Opposition and of the Liberal Party was Tony Abbott. Also unchanged were the leaders of the Nationals (Warren Truss) and the Greens (Senator Bob Brown). The Greens differ from the other three parties in that, due to the electoral system of proportional representation for the Senate, the Greens are essentially a Senate party, having only one member of the House of Representatives (out of 150) but having nine of the 76 senators. As can be seen from Tables <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy1-tbl-0001">1</a> and <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy1-tbl-0002">2</a>, the Greens' share of Senate seats roughly corresponds to their votes. Not so in the House of Representatives.
         </p>

         <p>Due to the Australian system of rotation of senators, those elected in August 2010 did not take their seats until 1 July 2011. Consequently, the numbers in the Senate on 1 July were 34 for the Liberal‐National Opposition (previously 37), 31 for the Labor government (previously 32), nine for the Greens (previously five) and two others.</p>
         
         <p>In the House of Representatives the year began with 73 members for the Liberal‐National Opposition, 71 for the Labor government, four Independents and one Green. The 150th member was the Speaker of the House. Given the support pattern of the cross‐bench, the reality was 75 for the government and 74 for the Opposition. By the end of the year, Labor and the Liberal‐Nationals had 72 members each, equating to 76 members supporting the government and 73 for the Opposition.</p>
         
         <p>My reason for mentioning the Speaker separately is easily explained. Section 40 of the Australian Constitution provides: ‘Questions arising in the House of Representatives shall be determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker. The Speaker shall not vote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall have a casting vote.’ Prior to 24 November the Speaker was Harry Jenkins (Labor) who had held the post continuously since Labor swept into office in November 2007. However, on 24 November Jenkins resigned and was replaced by Peter Slipper, a long‐time Liberal member. Slipper averted his expulsion from the Liberal Party by resigning his party membership immediately and becoming an Independent.</p>
         
         <p>There has been no by‐election for a House of Representatives seat since the August 2010 election. There was one Senate vacancy when Helen Coonan (Liberal, New South Wales) resigned her seat. A new Liberal senator was quickly chosen by the Parliament of New South Wales to replace her, leaving the party numbers unchanged.</p>

         <p>Last year, referring to 2010, I wrote:

<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>At the end of the year, the Gillard government was looking reasonably successful. Notwithstanding being in a minority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate it was, nevertheless, able to get parliamentary approval for all its legislation in the session which ran from late September to early December. Unfortunately for Gillard, however, significant doubts remain about her ability. She has plenty of people who wish her ill. These are mainly supporters of the Liberal and National parties, but also include some Labor supporters still resenting the way in which she had replaced Kevin Rudd. (Mackerras <span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011d</a></span>: 899)</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>One year on the situation remains essentially the same for the Gillard government. Although the opinion polls have been dreadful for Labor virtually all year, nevertheless Gillard has survived. For someone in her situation, mere survival for a year gives hope. The next election is due in late 2013, and I anticipate that the present term (known technically as ‘the 43rd Parliament’) will run for its full normal length of three years.
         
         
         <p>When Gillard replaced Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister in June 2010 she promised to fix three problems which Rudd seemed unable to rectify. These related to climate change, asylum seeker boats and the proposed Minerals Resource Rent Tax. In early 2011 she proclaimed that this would be her year of ‘decision and delivery’. I consider below the extent to which she succeeded.</p>

         <p>Referring to 2010, I wrote: ‘After the election was over and Labor needed to form a minority government, the deals it did with the Greens and independents included the imposition of some form of carbon tax, to be implemented no later than 2012’ (Mackerras <span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011d</a></span>: 894). However, during the election campaign Gillard did say several times that: ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ For that reason there was some disbelief that there would be a carbon tax so soon after the Prime Minister had promised otherwise.
         </p>
         
         <p>Yet on 25 February came a report headed ‘PM ready for fight on carbon tax’, which began: ‘Julia Gillard is determined to tax carbon from July 1 next year but faces months of tense negotiations with the Greens over industry compensation and a scare campaign from Tony Abbott on rising electricity and petrol prices’ (Maher <span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0012" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0012R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011a</a></span>,<span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011b</a></span>). The date of this report was significant, as the previous day significant politicians appeared together:
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Flanked by Greens senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne, and independents Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott, Ms Gillard and Climate Change Minister Greg Combet announced a carbon pricing mechanism with a fixed price from July 1 next year, which would move to an emissions trading scheme in three to five years.</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>
         
         
         <p>I expect the Gillard government to be defeated at the general election, which I predict will be held on 26 October 2013. When that happens I think people will look back at 24 February 2011 as the date which began a slide in the opinion polls from which Labor never recovered. Whatever Australians may think about global warming, they cannot forgive such a dramatic u‐turn within six months of an election.</p>
         
         <p>The next big event occurred on 10 July. Every detail of the carbon pricing scheme was revealed, together with (in effect) a guarantee that the legislation would secure passage through both houses of parliament. The plan was for the carbon tax to apply from 1 July 2012, moving to an emissions trading scheme on 1 July 2015. The tax would be paid by about 500 big emitters. The main target would be for a 5 per cent cut in emissions by 2020 over 2000 levels. Two out of three households would have their costs fully offset, and nine out of ten would have some compensation.</p>
         
         <p>Media commentary was very favourable. The main problem was that Tony Abbott continued his campaign of attack relentlessly. The opinion polls taken after the announcement showed an even greater falling off of support for Labor. Abbott promised, yet again, to repeal the legislation when he led a new conservative government. The plan was called the ‘Clean Energy Future’ but, when ordinary voters were polled, typically about twice as many opposed the plan as supported it.</p>
         
         <p>The legislation took the form of 18 cognate bills with titles such as ‘Clean Energy Bill 2011’. Then there was a separate bill dealing with the need for assistance to the steel industry. The reason for this was the special position of the steel industry, being both a high emitter and a trade exposed industry.</p>
         
         <p>In terms of giving the Gillard government a reputation for being competent, the passage of the bills through parliament was a great fillip. On 12 October the House of Representatives passed, by 74 votes to 72, the package of 18 bills. It also passed, by 75 votes to 71, the Steel Transformation Plan Bill. An extra Independent member supported payments to the steel industry who had opposed the main package. Abbott said: ‘I am giving you the most definite commitment any politician can give that this tax will go. This is a pledge in blood. This tax will go.’ Gillard said: ‘The House of Representatives has decided to seize the future with both hands.’ On Tuesday 8 November, the Senate passed the bills by 36 votes to 32. After the vote Gillard said:
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>We have made history – after all of these years of debate and division, our nation has got the job done, and from 1 July we will see a price on carbon pollution. This comes after a quarter of a century of scientific warnings, 37 parliamentary inquiries and years of bitter debate and divisions.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy1-sec-0005-title"> Asylum seeker boats</h2>
         
         <p>The Howard government had developed the toughest policies to deter refugees arriving on Australia's shores by boat. These various policies, though vile from a humanitarian point of view, were, nevertheless, successful in stopping these arrivals of self‐selected refugees. Howard and his ministers would damn them as ‘queue jumpers’, ‘illegal immigrants’ and so on, thereby ensuring that such refugees were not welcome. Under the Labor government, most of the nastier Howard‐era features were repealed. The coalition predicted that the boats would start coming again.</p>
         
         <p>They were right. That they were right was fully exploited by Abbott and his party during 2010. His most common slogan throughout the year was ‘Stop the Boats!’ That such a ridiculous assertion as ‘the Australian government has lost control of its borders’ (repeated many times by Abbott and his supporters) could gain such currency would surprise many foreign observers. Some more detail is needed to explain this paradox.</p>
         
         <p>For many years Australia has had an annual intake of 13,750 refugees. In an ideal world this would mean 13,750 people would come to Australia by the so‐called ‘front door’. However, in 2010 there were a record 6,232 refugees coming by boat, leaving only 7,518 refugees coming in by the ‘front door’. In 2011 the number of boat arrivals was 4,673, including 1,694 from Afghanistan, 1,584 from Iran, 326 from Iraq and 211 from Sri Lanka. The remaining 858 were ‘stateless’ or were from Pakistan, Vietnam or Burma.</p>
         
         <p>When Julia Gillard took over from Kevin Rudd in June 2010 she promised to fix the asylum seeker problem. The statistics above would seem to suggest that 2011 was less of a problem for her than 2010. A closer look, however, tells us that this is not so. To begin with recent years, the number of arrivals has been 11 in 2005 (Howard), 60 in 2006 (Howard), 148 in 2007 (Howard), 161 in 2008 (Rudd) and 2,726 in 2009 (Rudd). The peak, therefore, was reached in 2010 with 6,232 arrivals.</p>
         
         <p>However, in comparing 2011 with 2010 a more useful comparison is between the first two‐thirds of the year and the last one‐third. In 2010 there were 4,055 arrivals between January and August, and 2,177 in September to December. In 2011 there were 2,109 arrivals up to August and 2,564 from September onwards. Why would 2011 arrivals be half of those in 2010 in the first period and then exceed the 2010 number in the second period?</p>
         
         <p>In Mackerras (<span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011d</a></span>), referring to 2010, I noted the deterrent effect of the fact that about 5 per cent of boat people drown on their way to Australia. However, the main reason was that in May the Gillard government announced that it was negotiating with the government of Malaysia for a ‘people swap’. This became known as ‘the Malaysia solution’. Under the plan Australia would take 4,000 proven refugees from Malaysia and would send 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia who had arrived on Australian shores by boat. These ‘queue jumpers’ would, therefore, be sent to the back of the queue. This would be an effective deterrent. The coalition reacted very negatively to this announcement. They started a propaganda war against Malaysia, asserting that it has a dreadful human rights record. Cynics like me thought the reason for this had nothing to do with coalition concerns about the human rights of refugees and everything to do with a wish to prevent Gillard from stopping the boats. In my opinion, the coalition's real principle is ‘the more boats, the more votes for us’.
         </p>
         
         <p>The actual agreement was announced in July. At that point Gillard sent planes to Christmas Island to fly the first lot of asylum seekers to Malaysia. However, refugee advocates took the government to the High Court, which declared the agreement with Malaysia to be illegal under the existing Migration Act. The decision was handed down on 31 August which is why I nominated that as the most important date of the year, and the date for statistical comparison between the years 2010 and 2011. Those who arrived in May, June, July and August were taking an almighty gamble which paid off. Those who arrived after 31 August were scarcely taking a gamble at all.</p>
         
         <p>The left and the right supported the High Court's decision. The reason is easy to explain: the left (in political terms: the Greens) welcome asylum seeker boats, while the right (the Liberal‐National coalition) was delighted that the High Court was preventing Gillard from solving Labor's political problem.</p>
         
         <p>On 21 September the government introduced a bill designed to amend the Migration Act to circumvent the decision of the six majority justices. There was much to‐ing and fro‐ing but eventually the government gave up hope of enacting the bill. Within a month it abandoned the whole idea of offshore processing and decided to live with onshore processing, now known as ‘the Australia solution’. While 2010 is so far the year of record numbers of asylum seekers arriving by boat, it is now expected that 2012 will produce a new record. It is now easier for asylum seekers to seek a better life by turning up and demanding settlement.</p>
         
         <p>Deterrents to people arriving by boat include the need for a lengthy stay in detention (while refugee claims are assessed) plus the number of boat people who drown on their way to Australia. On 15 December 2010, a boat crashed into rocks on Christmas Island, killing 48 (Mackerras <span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011a</a></span>,<span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011b</a></span>,<span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011c</a></span>,<span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011d</a></span>: 896). A similar thing happened in December 2011. On 17 December a boat carrying 260 passengers from various countries sank off Prigi, Java. The number drowned was 226 and the number rescued was 34. The number of recorded deaths by drowning was 31 in 2009, 147 in 2010 and 285 in 2011. It is a pretty appalling situation. Hence, 2012 is expected to bring a record number of arrivals and, possibly, a record number of deaths by drowning also.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy1-sec-0006-title"> Proposed minerals resource rent tax</h2>
         
         <p>In early May 2010 Kevin Rudd announced that the government would proceed with a Mineral Resources Super Profits Tax (MRSPT) (Mackerras <span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011d</a></span>: 896). It would have been worth AUS$12 billion a year to federal revenues and would have been used to boost the retirement savings of workers, lower business taxes and build infrastructure. However, it was poorly designed and badly handled politically, resulting in its defeat and contributing to Rudd's downfall. Gillard's solution was a proposed tax re‐named as the ‘Minerals Resource Rent Tax’ (MRRT), where the government would get ‘only’ AUS$7 billion per annum.
         </p>
         
         <p>The year 2011 saw a lot of to‐ing and fro‐ing about this subject. The coalition made it clear that it would oppose the legislation and repeal it upon winning government. The Greens wanted it to be much tougher on the miners – more like the Rudd Super Profits Tax. They even threatened to vote it down in the Senate if it were not toughened. The lower house Independents wanted amendments. In the end, the bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 23 November in a form more‐or‐less satisfactory to all the players except the coalition. Only AUS$300 million was shaved off the value of the tax to suit the demands of the Independent members. Moreover, opinion polls repeatedly showed that this was the one area of contentious Labor policy which actually enjoyed continued popular support.</p>
         
         <p>With the MRRT certain to pass through the Senate early in 2012, it is time to consider 2011 as Gillard's self‐proclaimed ‘year of decision and delivery’. I would say that the MRRT is an unambiguous triumph for her. When the revenue actually starts to flow in July 2012 this will, I believe, be the conventional view. While the revenue collected will be only about half of that under the Rudd Super Profits Tax, it will have been achieved with democratic legitimacy. In the case of the Clean Energy Future legislation, I would call it a triumph for Gillard in the sense that she has succeeded in legislating good policy. Her problem, however, is that this good policy is very likely to be the main reason for her defeat at the October 2013 general election. All around Australia there will be billboards reminding everyone of her August 2010 words: ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ In the case of asylum seekers she has failed in the sense that there will almost certainly be more arrivals in 2012 and 2013 than there were in 2010 and 2011. However, it is possible that the coalition will get the blame.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy1-sec-0007-title"> Live cattle exports to Indonesia</h2>
         
         <p>Australia's exports of live cattle in 2010 earned us AUS$678 million, making it the seventh biggest earner of export income. Of that, AUS$318 million went to Indonesia, making it the largest market. This amount was expected to increase considerably in 2011. However, on the last day of May there was a prestigious television programme showing the most appalling cruelty inflicted on Australian cattle being slaughtered in certain Indonesian abattoirs. The practices included the gouging of the eyes of cattle, slashing with blunt knives and the breaking of limbs. It took about a quarter of an hour for each death to occur. Meanwhile, cattle next in line would look on with terror in their eyes. This was a truly sickening sight and caused an immediate public reaction.</p>
         
         <p>It was neither the wish of the government, nor of the Opposition, to lose this export income. However, on 7 June, after demands from the Labor caucus, the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Joe Ludwig, signed an order suspending the export of all live cattle to Indonesia. He said the ban would stay in place until safeguards had been adopted that would ensure the proper treatment of the animals along the whole supply chain. The Opposition, meanwhile, were strangely quiet. However, once the ban was put in place by the government, the Opposition started to say that it was a knee‐jerk reaction not justified by the facts. The decision would ruin a goodly part of our export income, they averred. Once the trade was lost, other countries would move in to take Australia's share and the loss would be permanent.</p>
         
         <p>From that point on the government was in a no‐win situation, politically. It felt compelled to re‐open the trade – but only after receiving guarantees from Indonesia that the cattle in future would be slaughtered as humanely as possible. The ban was lifted on 6 July to the outrage of the Greens, some of the Independents and even some Labor backbenchers. The Greens want the trade shut down entirely. The Liberals and Nationals are at the other extreme. Whatever one's view, the news of June 2011 was utterly dominated by this controversy.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy1-sec-0008-title"> Conclusion</h2>
         
         <p>As in 2010, the year 2011 ended with the Gillard government looking reasonably successful – but no more than that. It had achieved the difficult pricing of carbon. It had effectively achieved the Minerals Resource Rent Tax. However, there was still little light at the end of the tunnel for it on asylum seekers.</p>
         
         <p>An ill‐wisher of Julia Gillard, Phillip Adams, wrote in <i>The Weekend Australian</i> early in February <span><a href="#epdy1-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy1-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span> that: ‘Gillard will go down in history as … a footnote? A foolish mistake. Certainly she'll go down in history. Straight down.’ However, to me Gillard is an excellent Prime Minister who is clearly up to the job. The circumstances in which she governs are as difficult as an Australian Prime Minister could ever fear. Opinion polls show her government as losing every notional election in a landslide. They also continue to show Kevin Rudd preferred by the voting public as Prime Minister. Yet she achieves more than Rudd ever did.
         </p>
         
         <p>In response to Adams, I wrote: ‘From your writings it is clear that your favourite prime ministers have been Keating, Whitlam and Rudd, in that order. However, I confidently predict historians will rate the current woman to have been a better prime minister than any of those three men.’ Although there is much commentary about the possibility of just one by‐election (or one Independent defecting) that would bring Gillard down and because Tony Abbott was so frequently talking (in private) about how he would secure a mid‐term change of government, I wrote an article in which I very confidently predicted the parliament would run full‐term. I also think Gillard will rank in the top half of Australian Prime Ministers.</p>
