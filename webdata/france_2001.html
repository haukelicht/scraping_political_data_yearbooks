            <p>When J. Chirac (11 February) and L. Jospin (20 February) announced that they would run for the presidency – a decision largely expected by politicians and the public alike – it was obvious that the outgoing president and prime minister would be the main contenders for the post and, in particular, would compete in the second ballot. Many other candidates had already entered the race during 2001 and the first months of 2002. For the far left, A. Laguiller (<i>Lutte ouvrière</i>– Workers’ Fight), O. Besancenot (<i>Ligue communiste révolutionnaire</i>– Revolutionary Communist League) and D. Gluckstein (<i>Parti des Travailleurs</i>– Party for Workers) represented the Trotskyite parties. R. Hue ran for the Communist Party, C. Taubira for the Leftist radicals and N. Mamère for the Greens. J.P. Chevènement, a former member of the Socialist Party, was the candidate of the <i>Pôle républicain</i>, a tentative alliance between left‐ and right‐wing ‘republicans’ (i.e., sovereignists). The moderate camp was divided between F. Bayrou (UDF), A. Madelin (<i>Démocratie Libérale</i>) and C. Boutin, a traditionalist Catholic. J. M. Le Pen was the candidate for the National Front (FN) and B. Mégret for the <i>Mouvement national Républicain</i> (Republican National Movement), born from a split of the FN in 1999. The other candidates were C. Lepage, an independent Ecologist and J. Saint‐ Josse who represented the ‘hunters’ of the Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition Movement.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t4" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t5" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

            <p>Despite the number of candidates, the electoral campaign was particularly uninteresting. On the one hand, as the second ballot would necessarily oppose J. Chirac and L. Jospin, the other candidates were treated as marginal by the media – especially television, which devoted less time to the campaign than it had in 1995. On the other hand, there was no real political debate. The main issue was crime and violence, which gave rise to strong disputes but no clear explanations. The issues of unemployment, the future of the health system and pensions, Europe and globalisation were not at stake. Moreover, J. Chirac and L. Jospin seemed to compete for the same electorate. When Jospin began his campaign with the slogan ‘Life together’, Chirac summed up his candidacy with the sentence ‘Together, a great France’. While President Chirac avoided an overly rightist political orientation, Prime Minister Jospin, in his first speech on television, emphasised that his proposals ‘did not make up a socialist programme, but testified to a spirit of synthesis and rally’.</p>
            
            <p>The electorate was very dissatisfied with the electoral campaign and the candidates. On 13–15 April, 61 per cent of the people interviewed thought ‘the electoral campaign did not lead voters to go to the polls’ and 55 per cent felt that ‘it did not allow the voters to be informed about the candidates’ proposals’ (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">SOFRES 2003</a></span>). In fact, a large majority of the voters (from 69 per cent as far as insecurity was concerned to 56 per cent in the case of the future of the public sector) thought that there were ‘very few differences’ between Chirac and Jospin (French Electoral Panel 2002, 11–20 April). In January, according to an IPSOS poll, only 29 per cent of the people interviewed wanted the two of them to be candidates, while 59 per cent wanted different and new personalities.

         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss3"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss3-title"> The results</h3>
            
            <p>The first round of the election, on 21 April, was characterised by an ‘earthquake’ not foreseen by any pre‐election survey: the qualification of far‐right candidate J.M. Le Pen for the runoff and the consequent elimination of L. Jospin. The result was a stunning defeat for the Socialist candidate, while J.M. Le Pen increased his legitimacy. However, the vote also revealed the full and dramatic extent of the political disenchantment that had grown all during the 1990s.</p>
            
            <p>This political and electoral crisis had several aspects. First, one could point to the growth of abstention already observed in previous elections. In 2002, abstentions hit a 28.2 per cent record against 21.6 per cent in 1995.</p>
            
            <p>Second, one could emphasise the high degree of dissatisfaction with the mainstream parties and candidates (Hue, Jospin, Mamère, Bayrou, Madelin, Chirac), who won only 55.5 per cent of the vote. On the contrary, the three Trotskyite candidates, Taubira, Chevènement, Lepage, Boutin, Saint‐Josse, Le Pen and Mégret gained 44.5 per cent of the electorate and testified to the success of the anti‐system forces. However, the most striking point was the strength of both the extreme left and the extreme right. With 10.4 per cent of the vote, the far‐left candidates increased significantly their 1995 and 1999 totals (5.4 per cent and 5.2 per cent), while confirming their electoral success in the 2001 local elections. On the other end of the political spectrum, the two extreme right candidates won 19.2 per cent of the vote. J.M. Le Pen overtook his MNR rival and, compared to 1995, increased his share of the vote (16.2 per cent against 15 per cent).</p>
            
            <p>Third, all the candidates of the mainstream parties gained a very poor share of the vote. With 3.4 per cent, the Communist Party was on the path of a definitive decline that put an end to its central place in both French political life and the leftist camp. The Greens increased their 1995 score (5.3 per cent against 3.3 per cent), but did not really benefit from their participation in the government and did not become a real substitute for the Communist Party in a leftist coalition. However, the main defeated candidate and party were L. Jospin and the Socialists (PS) – not only because he did not qualify for the second ballot, but also because the 16.2 per cent of the vote gained represented a strong disavowal of the outgoing government. As in 1986, 1993 and 1994, when the PS suffered electoral defeats, one could emphasise the difficulties encountered by the PS to implement, in government, leftist policies or policies able to satisfy that part of the electorate that backed the left‐wing parties. L. Jospin captured only 32 per cent of the voters who felt close to a left‐wing party, and only 50 per cent of Socialist sympathisers.</p>
            
            <p>If we turn our attention to the moderate right, the results were no better. F. Bayrou (6.8 per cent) and A. Madelin (3.9 per cent) did not challenge J. Chirac or gain strong support for their particular goals: the identity of the UDF and a European credo for Bayrou; a very sophisticated and coherent liberal project for Madelin. However, the most striking event was the score of J. Chirac (19.9 per cent), less than in 1995 (20.8 per cent) when he faced Balladur who won 18.6 per cent of the vote for the UDF (10.7 per cent for his counterparts in 2002). Chirac's presidency received very low support even among his traditional clientele. He was backed by only 60 per cent of the voters close to the RPR and less than 40 per cent of UDF sympathisers.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> The second ballot</h3>
            
            <p>If the results of the first ballot of the presidential election testified to a crisis in the political system, J. Chirac appeared to be the main victor of the election. Qualified for the runoff, he had to compete against the FN leader. The second ballot then turned into a referendum against J.M. Le Pen. The mainstream leftist parties called for a Chirac vote. The extreme left candidates more reluctantly urged their electorate not to give the presidency to the National Front. Demonstrations in the streets and a consensual appeal on the part of the media to ‘fight against fascism’ also contributed to the outcome of the second ballot, which could be summed up along three lines. First, the mobilisation of the electorate increased, as the abstention rate fell from 28.4 per cent in the first ballot to 21.3 per cent in the runoff. Many young voters who had not been interested in the presidential race changed their minds as the choice became clearer. In addition, many leftist voters who abstained in the first round to protest the plural left Government went to the polls to vote against the FN.</p>
            
            <p>Second, the president of the National Front did not increase significantly his electoral influence compared to the scores and votes of extreme right (Le Pen and Megret) in the first ballot. Due to the increase in electoral participation, he won only 17.8 per cent of the votes cast as against 19.2 per cent for the two extreme right candidates in the first round. In terms of votes, he beat his own and Megret's clientele by 43,293 votes. This proved that the FN, although able to capitalise on an electorate motivated by specific issues (unemployment, immigration, crime and violence), could not go beyond that support to move from a ‘protest organisation’ to a ‘governing party’.</p>
            
            <p>Third, J. Chirac won the race with 82 per cent of the vote. This victory was very ambiguous, however. Leftist voters contributed strongly to Chirac's re‐election. Furthermore, after a weak electoral campaign for the first round, there was no political debate between 21 April and 5 May. The French had a president, but little information about the policies that the president would implement.</p>

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss6"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss6-title"> The circumstances and the electoral campaign</h3>
            
            <p>As is Fifth Republic tradition, once he was re‐elected, J. Chirac appointed a caretaker Prime Minister to form an interim government and prepare for the legislative elections of 9 and 16 June. The new president needed to take three essential factors into account: the left's contribution to his victory (a factor that meant he should not appear too much like the leader of an RPR clan); the need to keep in mind the reasons why people had voted as they did – particularly all those who had voted for the extreme left, the left, the extreme right, and all the marginal candidates; and the opportunity to unite all the parties of the moderate right to create ‘the president's party’. The appointment of Jean‐Pierre Raffarin as Prime Minister satisfied the first two criteria. Raffarin was a Chirac supporter, but he was not a member of the RPR. He was a regionally based politician, almost unknown nationally. In this way he could be seen as representing change among the governing elite. According to the third criterion, the unification of the RPR, DL and part of the UDF in the Union for the Presidential Majority (<i>Union pour la majorité présidentielle</i>– UMP) was the beginning of a kind of take‐over bid of nearly the whole of the conservative electorate.
            </p>
            
            <p>The electoral campaign was brief and focused on two main topics: security and cohabitation. N. Sarkozy, the new Minister of Home Affairs, began a very active campaign aimed towards the police, assuring them of his strong support and of his will to make policemen proud of their job. To the voters, he emphasised that his main concern would be to fight crime and violence, a task that implied a return to the authority of the state and the implementation of ‘zero tolerance’ policies.</p>
            
            <p>Naturally, J. Chirac, the Government and the UMP also called upon the voters to give a ‘clear and strong majority to the President’. The other parties attempted to make the opposite appeal – not to give all the powers (presidency, Senate, National Assembly) to the same political camp. This position was unlikely to be effective, however. According to an IPSOS poll (15 May 2002), 58 per cent of respondents thought cohabitation between Chirac and a new left‐wing government would be ‘a bad thing’. This was the view of 80 per cent of right‐wing voters, but also of 37 per cent of PCF sympathisers, 31 per cent of Socialist voters and 42 per cent of Greens.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss7"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss7-title"> The results</h3>
            
            <p>The electoral campaign failed to mobilise the voters. The abstention rate of 35.6 per cent was the highest ever recorded for a legislative election (previously, it had reached 33.9 per cent in 1988). This was due in part to the electoral calendar. Many voters had voted for Chirac in the second ballot of the presidential election and had a sense that this was ‘mission accomplished’. The low turnout was also part of a trend that has been developing for years. However, it demonstrated how the mobilisation between the two rounds of the presidential election had been more ‘emotional’ (against Le Pen) than a demonstration of confidence <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> J. Chirac and the political system more generally. Between 5 May and 9 June, the abstention rate had actually gone up more than 15 points, a clear reflection of protest, voter dissatisfaction and sanction.
            </p>
            
            <p>The legislative elections confirmed the very predictable defeat of the left and extreme left. The extreme left won only 2.8 per cent of the votes cast. The left gained 36.1 per cent, an increase on its first round score in the presidential election (27.2 per cent), but a huge drop from 1997 (44.3 per cent). If we include J. P. Chevènement and the <i>Pôle républicain</i> in the left's vote, the increase goes from 32.4 per cent in the presidential elections to 37.4 per cent in the legislative elections. As regards the fortunes of the left overall (left and extreme left), the results were very poor: 37.6 per cent in the presidential election (42.8 per cent if we include Chevènement) and 38.9 per cent (40.1 per cent including the <i>Pôle républicain</i>).
            </p>
            
            <p>However, the most striking event was the reorganisation of the left‐wing camp. The PS and its Left Radical allies benefited from both the far left and Communist misfortune and the Greens’ stagnation. They gained 25.7 per cent of the votes cast. The PS, therefore, regained the levels it had achieved in the 1995 presidential election and the 1997 general elections. However, the PS was far from recovering the electoral support it enjoyed in the 1980s (more than 35 per cent of votes cast) and its recovery in the 2002 legislative elections was within a much‐weakened left, where it reasserted its dominance but emerged isolated and deprived of strong allies.</p>
            
            <p>The main victors of the elections were the right‐wing parties, especially the UMP. First, a look at the overall score of the mainstream right (UMP, UDF and various right‐wing groupings) in 2002 compared to the first round of the presidential election indicates an important increase in the vote for the moderate right. The second set of observations refers to the distribution of the right's vote between the Chirac vote and the last bastion of the non‐Chirac right, the UDF. The UDF candidates, including those with no UMP challenger, took only 4.8 per cent of the votes cast as opposed to 33 per cent for the UMP. From this point of view alone, it is clear that the UDF was marginalised and had, in fact, lost the battle with the Gaullists and their neo‐Gaullist heirs for control of the moderate right's vote, a battle that dated back to 1962.</p>
            
            <p>For the National Front, the general elections were not a success as it won only 11.4 per cent of the vote, a loss of 5 points compared to 21 April. This strong decline had two causes. On the one hand, 28 per cent of Le Pen's voters either abstained or spoiled their ballots. On the other hand, 21 per cent of those who did vote moved to the UMP, and 6 per cent to a candidate of the left. The FN only held on to 71 per cent of its April electorate. This decrease in FN electoral influence seemed to be linked to three factors: abstention; the extreme right voters’ hostility to cohabitation and their desire to confirm the results of the presidential election and give Chirac a strong working majority; and the competition with the Government on the law and order issue. According to polls, 58 per cent of Le Pen's April voters declared themselves satisfied with the new government's initiatives and plans in this domain. This figure climbed to 72 per cent for those who had voted for Le Pen in April, but had voted UMP in the legislative elections.</p>
            
         </section></section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss8"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss8-title"> The Raffarin II Government and issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>After the legislative elections, J.P. Raffarin was confirmed in his position as Prime Minister on 19 June. With 27 people who actually sit around the cabinet table, the new government was larger than the previous one. Its political composition testified to the fracture between the UDF and the UMP insofar as the first obtained only 2 posts. If we turn our attention to the balance between the diverse components of the UMP, the ex‐RPR (with 11 positions against 3 for the ex‐DL and 4 for the ex‐UDF) appeared to maintain its political influence. This was all the more true as the more ancient Chirac backers occupied the key portfolios (Interior, Justice, Defence, Foreign Affairs and Agriculture). Compared to other right‐wing governments, an effort was made to open up to ‘new forces’. Seven women were full ministers (26 per cent) and seven ministers did not belong to a political party – that is, were supposed to represent civil society. The most striking point was the nomination of F. Mer, the manager of a big industrial company, as Minister of Economy. However, the cabinet did not represent the younger generation very well: the average age was 60.</p>
         
         <p>In the second half of the year, the Government advanced its policies in the domain of law and order. Under the title of ‘law for domestic security’, the hardliner N. Sarkozy announced a change in the balance between police and justice to the benefit of the police; the creation of jails for young delinquents; an increase in the number of policemen; and the definition of new crimes for the homeless, gypsies and prostitutes. Second, as promised by J. Chirac during the presidential electoral campaign, taxes were cut for the highest wages. Third, J.P. Raffarin presented, as a key project of his mandate, decentralisation and the necessity to give regions more autonomy. Fourth, the Prime Minister opened debate about the reform of pensions in the public and private sectors.</p>
         
         <p>The President and the Prime Minister communicated much, but voters remained a little sceptical. On the one hand, J. Chirac did not benefit from a honeymoon. According to SOFRES surveys, only 50 per cent of the people interviewed were ‘confident in his ability to handle the most important problems facing France’ in June 2002. The corresponding figure was 47 per cent in December. J.P. Raffarin proved to be more popular. In June, 60 per cent considered him competent to solve the main problems facing France; in December, 53 per cent shared the same attitude. Nevertheless, this was a relatively poor score for an incoming Prime Minister.</p>
