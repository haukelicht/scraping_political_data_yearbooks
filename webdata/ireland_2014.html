         <p>Irish politics was more turbulent than the economy in 2014. Bad results for the government coalition parties in the local and European elections prompted a leadership change in the junior government partner, the Labour Party, and a major cabinet reshuffle. Despite good news on the economic front, the Irish electorate's fatigue with austerity finally sparked significant public protest. Several scandals cost the government political capital, with one involving the police force leading to high‐level resignations and the establishment of an official inquiry.</p>

            <p>The resignation of a TD (Member of Parliament) and the death of another on consecutive days in March necessitated by‐elections to fill their seats. These by‐elections occurred on the same day as the local and European elections. Both TDs were originally government TDs, though the TD who resigned over a personal scandal had resigned the party whip soon after being elected for Labour in a by‐election in 2011. The opposition Socialist Party filled the resigned TD's seat while the government managed to hold the late TD's seat by running her sister. Running anyone without the family name of the deceased TD would have risked defeat for the government. By‐elections were also held later in the year to fill the <i>Dáil</i> seats of TDs, one independent and one government member, who successfully ran in the European elections. An independent and a Socialist candidate won each by‐election. This was particularly bad news for <i>Fianna Fáil</i> and <i>Sinn Féin</i>, which had been expected to win these seats.

            <p>For the second European Parliament election in a row, Ireland lost an EP seat with the total number falling from 12 to 11. The election was, as expected, about the economy, and to some extent the role of Europe in perpetuating the crisis. A number of independents and <i>Sinn Féin</i> tried to frame the election, with some success, in terms of pro‐ and anti‐austerity policies. Although <i>Fine Gael</i>’s support fell 6.4 percentage points to 22 per cent, it managed to retain four seats. Labour Party support fell by nine points, losing both of its MEPs, while <i>Fianna Fáil</i> dropped by just two points but lost two of its three seats. The big winner in this election was <i>Sinn Féin</i>, which gained three seats, up from none.

            <p>A reform of local government meant that town councils (the lowest level of local government in Ireland) were abolished, while some seats were added to city and county councils, bringing the number of seats in competition from 882 to 949. Though local councils are not powerful, they are an important feeder for parties to pick candidates making their way up the political ladder. There was a significant, if unsurprising, drop in support for the government parties compared to their previous local election results. <i>Fine Gael</i> support dropped from 32 to 24 per cent, costing them 105 council seats, to fall to 235 seats. Labour's support halved to just over 7 per cent nationally. While the main opposition party, <i>Fianna Fáil</i>, was stagnant on the 25 per cent it received in 2009 (then its worst‐ever local election performance), it overtook its historical rivals, <i>Fine Gael</i>, in total number of seats by adding 49 to achieve 267. <i>Sinn Féin</i> performed strongly, increasing its support by seven points and gaining 105 seats, mostly at the expense of Labour. Small parties and independents also gained ten points in support, winning 238 seats nationally – more than the main party of government. While there was a significant change of party labels in many seats, there was almost equally a significant change of personalities within the parties: as a whole, half of the defeated councillors lost to intra‐party rivals (Courtney <span title=""><a href="#epdy12092-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12092-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>).

         <p>The government parties’ results in the local and European elections prompted a change in the Labour Party leadership and a cabinet reshuffle. The first major action of the new leader, Joan Burton, was to remove some of her more experienced cabinet colleagues, leading to three promotions to cabinet. In contrast, the dynamic in <i>Fine Gael</i> was more musical chairs than firing squad. While three out of five Labour personalities changed in the process, <i>Fine Gael</i> added just two out of nine. The first changes came about prematurely in the wake of the crisis in the police force. The Minister for Children, Frances Fitzgerald, was moved to Justice (a post rarely occupied by a woman) and the party whip, Charles Flanagan, was promoted to the Children portfolio. Further changes took place in July in conjunction with the Labour reshuffle. Health Minister and deputy leader of <i>Fine Gael</i>, James Reilly, was moved to the Department of Children and replaced in Health by the younger and more popular Minister for Transport in an attempt to change public perception about the government's performance in the department. The Minister for Arts was demoted and replaced by a relatively unknown backbencher, while the junior minister for European Affairs was promoted to Minister for Transport. Labour and <i>Fine Gael</i> switched cabinet portfolios, with Charles Flanagan moving again in July, this time to Foreign Affairs and Trade (replacing Labour's Éamon Gilmore). The resignation of <i>Fine Gael</i> Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Phil Hogan to take up his new post as European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development resulted in the promotion of Labour's Alan Kelly.

         <p>When the extent of the Labour Party's losses in the local and European elections became clear in the days following the vote, Labour leader Éamon Gilmore resigned, stating that the party would be best served with a new leader. Much of the blame for his failure as leader was identified with his decision to take the portfolio of Foreign Affairs during the formation of the government – a post which kept him from tending to the grassroots of the party and the electorate because of frequent international engagements. A very public six‐week campaign for the Labour leadership ensued, with the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, winning easily. Her selection created a vacancy in the deputy leadership of the party, with the contest being won by Alan Kelly. It was hoped that Burton's personal popularity (she had publicly distanced herself from some of the government's more unpopular policies) would translate into increased popularity for the Labour Party generally; despite an initial bounce this had not sustained itself until the end of 2014.</p>

            <p>The government also failed to reap any benefits of an improving economy by mishandling major political events. The first of these was in relation to a controversy within the <i>Garda Siochána</i> (police force) where claims of malpractice were not adequately investigated. These claims involved abuse of the road traffic penalty points system. The officers involved in highlighting the malpractice were effectively bullied by their superior officers. The Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice fully supported the senior management of the force until a report undertaken by a senior barrister was released in May. The report forced the government to accept that claims of malpractice were not fully investigated, triggering the resignation of the Minister for Justice, the <i>Garda</i> Commissioner and ultimately the Secretary General of the Department of Justice. At issue was that the Department and the <i>Gardaí</i> are not independent of each other, leading to some accusations of ‘political policing’. Separately, an issue of unauthorised taping of phone conversations at police stations going back decades also arose, which could potentially undermine the convictions of hundreds of prisoners.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny was also implicated in the affair as it was alleged that he had sent the Secretary General (SG) of the Department of Justice to the <i>Garda</i> Commissioner's house to effectively sack him. Kenny merely stated that he sent the SG to communicate the government's concern at the taping controversy, but the Commissioner immediately resigned upon receiving the message. Despite the resignations of the <i>Garda</i> Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and the SG, Kenny himself managed to survive the scandal relatively unscathed.

            <p>Further political controversy arose following the European and local elections during the process of filling a seat in the upper house of parliament, the <i>Seanad</i>. One government Senator was elected to the EP in June, leaving the opposition with a 30–29 majority in that house, and necessitating a by‐election. Only sitting members of the two houses of parliament can vote in <i>Seanad</i> by‐elections, and with the senior government party's significant plurality in this electorate, any candidate it put forward was guaranteed to be elected. <i>Fine Gael</i> selected the businessman John McNulty. The selection (and presumed election) was to establish a profile for the candidate in the next general election to the <i>Dáil</i>. But to boost his profile and to ensure his eligibility for the <i>Seanad</i> by‐election itself (there is a very odd electoral system with non‐geographic constituencies based on corporatist mechanisms) the government appointed him to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA). This was seen as an abuse of the appointment procedures as McNulty would have had to resign from the board on being elected to the <i>Seanad</i>, leaving him with, at most, a four‐week term on the board. The newly appointed Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht handled media interviews poorly as she tried to explain the appointment. The controversy came to a head when the candidate, who could not formally remove his name from the ballot, instead asked TDs and Senators not to vote for him. An independent candidate was elected and the government remained in the minority in the upper house, although this did not cause any significant problems in passing legislation. In addition to the controversy in the police, the botched <i>Seanad</i> appointment made the government further appear to be employing the type of dubious political manoeuvres for which it had criticised its predecessors.

            <p>The Irish public's response to austerity since the economic crash hit in 2008 was muted in comparison to countries like Greece, where full‐scale riots occurred (Pappas &amp; O'Malley <span title=""><a href="#epdy12092-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12092-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>). Although the EU/IMF bail‐out programme officially ended in December 2013, the last austerity measure – the introduction of water charges – had not been fully implemented. A national water utility, Irish Water, had been established in 2012, but public resistance to the policy gained momentum in 2014. Protest groups organised on social media to prevent the installation of water meters. The Socialist Party's leading role in the opposition to water meters resulted in electoral success in two by‐elections, much to the annoyance of Ireland's rising political stars, <i>Sinn Féin</i>, who some perceived as being too moderate on the issue.
            </p>
            
            <p>Cross‐class opposition to water charges resulted in frequent local protest marches, halting of meter installation and several large national protests. In October, the largest anti‐austerity protest occurred in Dublin. This caused the government to introduce a government grant to offset the cost of water charges which would effectively halve a household's annual water bill. They also capped the charge to the extent that metering would be a moot exercise, though they justified the continuation of the metering process on the basis that if households used less than the cap, they could claim back the cost of the difference. It is likely that, if re‐elected, the government will attempt to fully establish the water charges regime as it was originally envisaged.</p>
