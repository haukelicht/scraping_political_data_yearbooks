         <p>The political year 2012 was comparatively quiet. No election was held, and the government stayed in office without too much difficulty. There was one ministerial resignation, linked to events that could be described as a scandal, but the stability of the government was not seriously affected. The fact that the centre‐right coalition government does not command a parliamentary majority was, however, a continued cause for concern. Opinion polls were also a worry for the government, indicating a lead for the red‐green opposition parties for most of the year, as well as increasing support for the far right Sweden Democrats. Two parties changed leader, with the Social Democrats doing so for the second time in ten months.</p>

         <p>In early March, a news story broke about Swedish defence industry connections with Saudi Arabia. The background was an agreement over arms exports to Saudi Arabia, initially reached in 2005 by a <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0009" id="#epdy12032-bib-0009R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Social Democratic government</a></span> and inherited by the centre‐right Alliance government when it took office the following year. In 2007, discussions began about Swedish participation in the creation of a factory for the production of arms, explosives and missile fuel to be located in Saudi Arabia. The main responsibility for the project was with the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI), a subsidiary of the Ministry of Defence. It was reported that FOI had set up a separate company to deal with the Saudi Arabian contacts, apparently with the aim of avoiding public attention. Defence Minister Sten Tolgfors denied any knowledge of improper dealings, and in effect put the blame on FOI. There were, indeed, reports suggesting that measures had been taken to protect him from direct involvement in the politically sensitive project, but opposition representatives were sceptical of his explanation and the matter was reported to the parliamentary Committee on the Constitution. Tolgfors stood by his story, but resigned on 29 March, citing media pressure and general fatigue. His duties were initially assumed by the Infrastructure Minister Catharina Elmsäter Svärd, but on 18 April the 46 year‐old Karin Enström was appointed the new Defence Minister. A member of parliament for the Moderate Party since 1998, and a captain in the Amphibious Corps, Enström had no previous government experience. The political significance of her appointment was limited, but it did mean that the Swedish government had a majority of women for the first time in history.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ‘Saudi Affair’ was negative for the government, but the damage should not be overstated. A criminal investigation was initiated, but dropped in September. The Committee on the Constitution will present a report in 2013, which could contain criticism against the government, but further political casualties are unlikely. A bigger problem for the government was the majority situation in parliament. The pivotal position of the Sweden Democrats meant that the government continuously ran the risk of not getting its proposals through. Indeed, the government was defeated on a number of occasions. For the most part, it accepted such defeats after the conclusion of the parliamentary committee deliberation stage, and let matters rest without a formal vote in the chamber, but there were also cases when the government lost plenary votes. In July 2012, the Sweden Democrats presented a report claiming that they had contributed to 30 government defeats in the parliamentary year 2011–2012. In six of these cases, the bills had been voted on in the chamber (Sweden Democrats <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12032-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012a</a></span>). Before the end of 2012 there were another nine government defeats, in two cases after plenary votes (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 7 January 2013). The government defeats were not on politically significant issues and did not lead to government crises. It was, nevertheless, clear that the government was forced into a more cautious approach after the 2010 election, sometimes avoiding making proposals that risked defeat. One potentially difficult situation was avoided in February 2012 when Minister for Social Security Ulf Kristersson (Moderate) was forced into a public apology for failing to act on two parliamentary decisions, where the four parties outside government had demanded changes in the sickness benefit system. The delay, plus statements by Kristersson in which he expressed disagreement with the parliamentary decisions, led to a negative reaction among the opposition parties. When it became clear that all four non‐government parties were considering a vote of no‐confidence, Kristersson backed down and promised that a bill would be forthcoming (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 22 February 2012; <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0008" id="#epdy12032-bib-0008R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references"><i>Riksdag &amp; Departement</i></a></span>, 27 February 2012).
         </p>
         
         <p>Three leadership changes, or challenges, took place in 2012; all in January. The first was when Jonas Sjöstedt succeeded Lars Ohly as leader of the Left Party. There were hopes that Sjöstedt would improve the party's opinion poll ratings, which had plummeted under Ohly, but they failed to materialise. After a brief early upsurge, the party oscillated between 4 and 6 per cent for most of the year. In the Christian Democrats, leader Göran Hägglund was challenged for the leadership by former government minister Mats Odell in 2011. The matter was resolved at an extra party congress on 28 January 2012. Hägglund held on to the leadership with a relatively comfortable majority, but his support was far from unanimous. The party remained in deep crisis, with opinion poll ratings repeatedly indicating support levels below the 4 per cent representational threshold.</p>
         
         <p>There were problems also in the Social Democrats. Håkan Juholt took over the leadership in March 2011, but soon ran into a number of difficulties, where his personal integrity as well as political judgement were questioned (Widfeldt <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12032-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). He survived into 2012, but the pressure on him intensified – not least due to highly worrying poll ratings, in several cases below 25 per cent. Following some ill‐judged comments at a conference on defence policy, Juholt was effectively forced to resign on 21 January (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 22 January 2012). Party secretary Carin Jämtin initially assumed the leadership duties, but this was intended as a short‐term solution and the process to find a successor began immediately. On 26 January, the party's executive committee proposed Stefan Löfven as the new permanent leader. This was confirmed by the party's national executive the following day, and was to be ratified by the party congress in 2013. Löfven thus became the ninth Social Democrat leader in the party's 123‐year history (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 27 January 2012).<a class="noteLink scrollableLink" title="Link to note" id="epdy12032-note-0001_6-controller" href="#epdy12032-note-0001_6" aria-controls="epdy12032-note-0001_6" aria-haspopup="false" aria-expanded="true" aria-label="Link to Note">1</a><span class="footNotePopup" id="epdy12032-note-0001_6" aria-labelledby="epdy12032-note-0001_6-controller"><button class="footNoteClose"><i class="icon-tools_close" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>Identification of Stefan Löfven as the ninth leader of the Social Democrats does not include Claes Emil Tholin, who is sometimes identified as leader of the party between 1896 and 1907. His formal position, however, was chair of the party's executive committee. He was not elected leader by the congress and can hardly be described as a party leader in the modern sense. Between the party's formation in April 1889 and 1896, it had no individual leadership (see www.socialdemokraterna.se/Vart‐parti/Var‐historia/Partiledare/).<span class="chevronDown"></span></span></p>
         
         <p>Born in 1957, Löfven led the blue‐collar private sector trade union IF Metall from 2006 until becoming party leader. He has never been a member of parliament and will, therefore, not be able to participate in parliamentary debates until after the next election, set for September 2014. Ideologically, Löfven is regarded as more centrist than the left‐leaning Juholt. The change from Juholt to Löfven and its circumstances were indicative of the party's decline. Until the early 2000s the Social Democrats had been the natural party of government, with long leadership reigns. When Mona Sahlin took over the leadership in 2007, no <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0009" id="#epdy12032-bib-0009R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Social Democratic</a></span> leader had held the post for less than ten years, and each had served as prime minister. Sahlin, however, led the party for four years, Juholt did so for ten months, and neither became prime minister. After Löfven's appointment, the poll ratings improved to over 35 per cent in May and June. They then declined to 31–32 per cent towards the end of the year. Thus, although the more acute crisis at the beginning of 2012 was averted, there was little to suggest that the party's long‐term decline had been halted.
         </p>
         
         <p>The red‐green opposition parties were ahead of the four governing Alliance parties in opinion polls for most of the year. Still, neither of the two main blocs looked capable of commanding a majority of its own because support levels for the immigration‐critical Sweden Democrats (SD) continued to increase, even reaching double figures in some polls taken near the end of the year. SD, however, remained stigmatised by other parties as well as a large part of the electorate. The party's image problem is partly explained by its compromising origins and history, but also by the fact that it still tends to attract extremists and oddballs. As part of an ongoing process to clean up the party image, a ‘zero tolerance’ policy was announced in October. In a letter to all the party's representatives in public bodies, SD leader Jimmie Åkesson stated that there was no room for extremists, racists, grudge holders (<i>rättshaverister</i>) or ‘others with a personal need for political or private excesses’ in the party. Those with such inclinations were asked to leave voluntarily, or face expulsion (Sweden Democrats <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12032-bib-0011R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012b</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Shortly after the zero tolerance policy had been announced, the tabloid <i>Expressen</i> published video clips of three Sweden Democrats involved in a heated argument with a stand‐up comedian of Kurdish origin on a street in central Stockholm. In the clip, SD representatives can clearly be heard making derogatory statements against the comedian, and are also seen picking up metal bars, in what looks like preparation for a fight. The incident had taken place in June 2010, before the party's electoral breakthrough, but two of the three Sweden Democrats appearing on the video were elected to parliament in September the same year. One of the future SD parliamentarians appearing on the video, Erik Almqvist, resigned from his position as economics spokesperson and left parliament in 2013. Another, Kent Ekeroth, stepped down as spokesperson on justice, but stayed in parliament. The affair received massive media attention, but did not seem to negatively affect the party's opinion poll ratings (<i>Expressen</i>, 14 November 2012, and several ensuing dates).
         </p>
         
         <p>Economically, the pattern of stagnation from the previous year continued. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.8 per cent in 2012, compared to 3.7 per cent in 2011, according to a report published in March 2013 by the <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0005" id="#epdy12032-bib-0005R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">National Institute of Economic Research (NIER)</a></span>. The NIER projected a marginal future recovery to 1.3 per cent in 2013 and 2.3 per cent in 2014. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12‐month changes in the Consumer Price Index) was 1.9 per cent at the beginning of 2012, but then declined throughout the year, and from July it was below Riksbanken's target rate of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of +/–1 percentage point. In November and December, there was deflation (–0.1 per cent). In response, the <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0006" id="#epdy12032-bib-0006R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">central bank Riksbanken</a></span> lowered the Repo interest rate three times. At the beginning of 2012 it was 1.75 per cent; by the end of the year it was 1.00 per cent. None of these decisions were taken unanimously by Riksbanken's six‐member executive board. The dissenting minority argued that the interest rates, and/or the projected interest rate path in the Monetary Policy Update, should be set even lower (<i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, 19 December 2012; Riksbanken <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12032-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>There were disagreements about the economic situation also in the political debate. When the main budget was presented in September, the opposition accused the government of an overly optimistic economic outlook, claiming that the tax cuts and investments proposed in the budget were irresponsible. According to figures from the National Debt Office, there was a fiscal deficit of SEK 25 billion (€2.9 billion) for 2012, compared to a surplus of SEK 68 billion (€6.8 billion) for 2011. The same organisation reported that the national debt had grown slightly to over SEK 1 billion (€134 million) by the end of 2012 – an increase of SEK 5 billion (€581 million) compared to twelve months earlier. Relative to GDP, the national debt rose from 29 to 32 per cent. The national debt was still regarded as being under control, and compared favourably with most other EU countries. The situation on the labour market, however, was widely considered as problematical. The overall rate of unemployment, as a percentage of the population aged 16–64, rose to 6.5 per cent (3.5 per cent in open unemployment and 3.0 per cent in labour market schemes) – an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2011. The total number of redundancies rose from 46,000 to 71,000, and the rate of unemployment was projected to continue rising in the next few years (figures and projections from the <span><a href="#epdy12032-bib-0013" id="#epdy12032-bib-0013R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Swedish Public Employment Service</a></span>).
