         <p>At the beginning of the year, presidential elections took place in Portugal. A pre‐electoral campaign began during the month of December 2010. Throughout the period of the campaign, President Anibal Cavaco Silva led commandingly in most opinion polls. The only question remaining was whether he would be elected in the first round by achieving more than 50 per cent of the vote, or whether there was need for a second round. The main supporters of Cavaco Silva's re‐election were the centre‐right Social Democrats (Partido Social Democrata, PSD) and the conservative Democratic Social Centre/People's Party (CDS‐PP).</p>
         
         <p>All the other parliamentary parties had their own candidates; however, none of them were real challengers to Cavaco Silva according to different opinion polls published during December and January. The Socialist Party (Partido Socialista, PS) and the Left Bloc (Bloco da Esquerda, BE) supported the poet and well‐known politician Manuel Alegre. He was very keen to highlight issues related to the social dimension of the financial crisis. However, during the campaign it was clear that the impact of the financial and euro crisis affecting Portugal was so crucial for the survival of the country that he clearly did not want to undermine the position of Cavaco Silva, who has a strong reputation as an economist in Portugal and whose advice was clearly of crucial importance for the incumbent minority Socialist government.</p>
         
         <p>The candidate of the Communist Party (Partido Comunista Português, PCP) was Francisco Lopes, who is a longstanding leader of the party and Member of Parliament. He focused his campaign on the impact of the euro crisis on the Portuguese population. He particularly blamed Cavaco Silva and the Socialist government for the situation that Portugal was in. José Manuel Coelho was the candidate of the tiny Party of New Democracy (Partido da Nova Democracia, PND) which he represents in the regional assembly of Madeira. The PND is not represented in the national parliament. He clearly focused his campaign against the clientelism and patronage of the Social Democrats in Madeira, particularly regional president Alberto João Jardim who has been in power since 1979.</p>
         
         <p>Two candidates, the physicians Fernando Nobre and Defensor Moura, were independents. They clearly wanted to capture the vote of those who were disappointed or disaffected with the political system. Fernando Nobre in particular relied on associations within civil society because he was a strong activist in such organisations related to medicine. He founded the International Medical Association and was quite engaged in taking part in international missions as a physician. Defensor Moura is close to the Socialist Party, but was not supported by it. Nevertheless, he decided to take part in the elections as an independent. His campaign slogan was ‘Fight against Resignation’ and he also targeted civil society to show that there is also politics outside the world of the political parties.</p>
         
         <p>The presidential elections confirmed more or less the predictions of the opinion polls. Cavaco Silva was re‐elected with 52.95 per cent of the vote in the first round. The Socialist candidate came a distant second with 19.1 per cent. The big surprise was third‐placed independent Fernando Nobre, who was able to galvanise civil society groups and people who did not want to vote for the candidates of the parties by achieving 14.1 per cent of the vote. The Communist candidate Francisco Lopes came fourth with 7.14 per cent. José Manuel Coelho got 4.51 per cent of the vote and was able to project himself nationally, and reach beyond his small support base in Madeira. Independent candidate Defensor Moura got 1.59 per cent of the vote.</p>
         
         <p>Due to the number of candidates, Cavaco Silva was not able to achieve an improvement on the results of his first election in 2006. This clearly shows that he was not able to gain the support of the left and become an integrative figure as president of all Portuguese.</p>

         <p>As during 2010, Portugal continued to face a difficult situation within the ongoing euro crisis. The financial markets continued to put Portugal under pressure. The financing of the Portuguese state through emission of sovereign bonds had to deal with ever growing interest rates, which were still manageable by the government. The credit rating of the country was successively downgraded throughout 2010 and 2011. The government agreed over the year on three austerity packages in order to reduce the budget deficit (Magone <span title=""><a href="#epdy28-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy28-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011a</a></span>,<span title=""><a href="#epdy28-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy28-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011b</a></span>: 1002–1004). The Socialist minority government was only able to achieve approval in parliament through the abstention of the main opposition party PSD under new leader Pedro Passos Coelho.
         </p>
         
         <p>The José Socrates government was under considerable pressure from the European Commission and his counterparts in the Eurogroup to introduce even more austerity measures in early 2011. Therefore, a fourth package of austerity measures was proposed by the Socrates government in March 2011. This was opposed by all political parties in the Assembly of the Republic. Consequently, Socrates threatened to resign if his package of austerity measures which was imposed and negotiated with the European Commission were not approved by parliament. On 23 March 2011, the fourth package of austerity measures (Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento IV‐PEC IV) was rejected by all political parties in the Assembly of the Republic (<i>Semanário Económico</i>, 23 March 2011). Soon thereafter, Socrates announced his resignation. One week later he met with Cavaco Silva. After consultation with the Council of the State, Cavaco Silva called for early elections to take place on 5 June. The Socialist Party questioned the role of Cavaco Silva in the whole process towards the political crisis. He was not engaged in the process and seemed allegedly not to want to help the government in terms of achieving support for the austerity package.
         </p>
         
         <p>The resignation of Socrates led to turmoil in the markets and within two weeks the rating of Portuguese sovereign bonds was downgraded by all three main agencies – Moodys, Fitch and Standard &amp; Poors – to close to ‘junk’. The interest rates skyrocketed in the weeks following the vote in parliament and Socrates' subsequent resignation. Although Socrates had intended to prevent this situation since 2009, the markets forced Portugal to take a bail‐out from the European Finance Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Finance Stability Mechanism (EFSM), like Greece and Ireland had already done. Negotiations with the trojka during April and May led to an agreement of a bailout of €78 billion, which also should be used for the Portuguese banks, most of them without liquidity. It was the minority Socialist government that negotiated the agreement; however, the trojka consisting of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, wanted some kind of assurances from all of the political parties that they would continue this policy after the legislative elections scheduled for 5 June 2011. Just the two right centre political parties PSD and CDS‐PP made these assurances to the trojka and voted with the Socialist Party for the bail‐out in Parliament. Both the communists and the Left Bloc refused to meet with the trojka and support the bail‐out. A Memorandum of Understanding was negotiated which intended to reduce public expenditure considerably. The Memorandum was agreed and signed on 3 May 2011.</p>
         
         <p>The Memorandum of Understanding is quite a long and detailed document, which includes short‐ and medium‐term measures to improve Portuguese public finances. Some of the measures were immediate in order to deal with the present situation; others were medium‐ to long‐term measures to restructure the relationship between the state and the economy. It clearly set out the fiscal and economic policies between May 2011 and end of 2014. The different measures were divided into different headings.

         <p>The bail‐out debate about Portugal became European after Timo Soini, leader of the Finnish party True Finns, campaigned against Finnish support for the bail‐out. In the end, he was outvoted by the other more moderate parties (<i>Bloomberg online</i>, 12 May 2011; see also Sundberg in this issue). Nevertheless, the Portuguese case showed that a country's politics have now become European. On 17 May, a bail‐out of €78 billion was agreed by the finance ministers in the European Council (<i>European Voice online</i>, 17 May 2011).

         <p>Soon after, Portuguese political parties began their electoral campaign for the early general election on 5 June. Due to the finance crisis, political parties were all under considerable pressure to present alternatives for the population. Socrates and the Socialist Party focused their campaign on blaming the opposition, particularly the Social Democrats, for putting Portugal in this situation, whereby decisions on Portuguese finances and public policy are now taken only with approval from outside. The Socialist Party was very keen to portray main opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho as a representative of Portuguese business and the banking sector. On the other hand, Social Democratic leader Coelho blamed the Socialists for having delayed for so long the request for a bail‐out, so that the overall process of austerity will be even harder than envisaged. The leader of the Democratic Social Centre, Paulo Portas, was very keen to show his statesmanship and his wish to carry out the difficult Memorandum of Understanding with the Social Democratic Party, if both parties achieved a commanding majority. The smaller left‐wing parties were against the bail‐out because it would just create even more poverty in the country. Both parties clearly emphasised the social impact of the austerity package on the vast majority of the population.</p>
         
         <p>Opinion polls predicted a victory for the centre‐right coalition between the Social Democrats and the Democratic Social Centre. The Socialists would get second place after the Social Democrats and the Communists would do better than the Left Bloc. The results confirmed the predictions of the opinion polls. The population gave a comfortable majority to the centre‐right parties, while PS lost 8 percentage points. The Communists were able to improve slightly on their previous results; however, the Left Bloc lost almost half of their electorate. On the same night, Socrates admitted defeat and resigned from all public offices including his re‐elected parliamentary seat. He expressed his intention of returning to private life. The big winner of the night was the PSD under the leadership of Passos Coelho and the CDS‐PP led by charismatic Paulo Portas.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy28-sec-0005"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy28-sec-0005-title"> The formation of the new government under Passos Coelho</h2>
         
         <p>The clear victory of the PSD and CDS‐PP gave a commanding majority of 132 out of 230 MPs in the new parliament. This was an important message to the international community and financial markets that the government in charge of implementing the long Memorandum of Understanding could rely on a stable majority. Due to the tight implementation roadmap agreed with the trojka, the Portuguese government was formed in record time. One of the reasons for this is that it was a minimum winning coalition of two political parties that were ideologically close to each other. Moreover, such a coalition with the same parties and with Paulo Portas existed between April 2002 and February 2005. Last but not least, both parties had already agreed to carry out the necessary austerity measures before the elections. The coalition agreement was quite similar to that of the 2002–2005 coalition government.</p>
         
         <p>Two weeks after the elections, on 21 June, the new government was already in office. One important factor in reducing the time of transition was the engagement of Cavaco Silva who clearly regarded this fast track change of government as an important message for the markets. Passos Coelho is a longstanding politician of the PSD, particularly in the youth association. He holds a first degree in economics from the private Lusiada University. Afterwards he worked in the private sector as a manager. Another important aspect of his CV is that his family originates from Angola and returned after the decolonisation process to Portugal when he was quite young.</p>
         
         <p>Due to the crisis, all government ministers accepted a pay cut and Cavaco Silva gave up his wages. Moreover, Passos Coelho decided to form a small cabinet of no more than 12 members. Out of these 12 members, four were independent. Among them are Minister of Economy and Employment Alvaro Santos Pereira, a former university professor from British Columbia in Canada and University of York in the United Kingdom, and Minister of Finances Vitor Gaspar, also a professor at the New University Lisbon and the director‐general of the research department of the European Central Bank between 1998 and 2004. It was quite important for Prime Minister Passos Coelho to include well‐known economists in his cabinet as a positive message for the international markets.</p>

         <p>After the sudden resignation of José Socrates on general election night, the leadership contest in the Socialist Party soon began. In the end, one of the more established leaders of the party, António José Seguro, was elected as the new secretary‐general on 23 July. In the primaries, Seguro got 23,903 votes (68 per cent) and Francisco Assis, his main rival, 11,257 votes (32.02 per cent). Seguro is regarded as a moderate and, in spite of inside resistance, the party has acted responsibly towards the new Passos Coelho government.</p>

         <p>The new government started to work immediately in order to achieve the targets for the first visit of the trojka on the same day (<i>Semanário Economico</i>, 21 June 2011). The new government decided to work through the summer to organise its strategy to implement the substantial number of measures agreed with the Trojka.
         </p>
         
         <p>Throughout the second half of the year, it became clear that the public deficit target for 2011 would be difficult to achieve, in spite of continuing assurances by the Prime Minister. It became clear that successive governments had difficulties making an inventory of all the debt owed by the state.</p>
         
         <p>In early September it was clear that there was a financial shortfall of about 1.1 per cent of GDP in relation to the targets of 5.9 per cent. The period of the Socialist government in early 2011 was held responsible for this. Moreover, it became clear that the autonomous government of Madeira had a huge deficit that had allegedly been covered up until then. A financial gap of €1.68 billion was also found in the budget of the regional government of Madeira. This became a major problem for the government because the majority government there was of the same colour as the dominant party in the ruling coalition in Lisbon. In the end, the government also had to apply the same principles of budget deficit contention in relation to the government of Madeira in order not to lose credibility (<i>Expresso</i>, 16 September 2011; <i>Correio da Manhã</i>, 17 September 2011; <i>Expresso</i>, 19 September 2011).
         </p>
         
         <p>In October and November, the new government began to prepare its budget for 2012. One important aspect of the strategy was to get support from the PS for the budget. Negotiations between the centre‐right coalition government and the PS were not very fruitful. The coalition government blamed the former Socialist government for the sorry state of the finances and alienated the main opposition party. The new PS leader Seguro had to deal with a radical opposition that did not want the party to work with the centre‐right coalition or support the austerity measures included in the 2012 budget. On 30 November, the Socialist parliamentary group abstained in the vote, while the Communists, the Greens (associated with the Communist Party) and the Left Bloc voted against.</p>
         
         <p>In December, the government decided to use the surplus of the pension fund of the public banking sector in order to cover the financial shortfall. With this measure, the government was able to keep the budget deficit at 4.1 per cent of GDP, well below the target of 5.9 per cent. However, the trojka asked a high price for this measure. The Portuguese government had to cut any holidays and Christmas salaries (13th and 14th month salaries) until 2013. This was viewed quite negatively by the press and the population because Coelho had promised during the election campaign that he would not cut wages in the civil service. This measure was particularly tough for civil servants with a small income, who were very dependent on these two extra wages in order to balance their accounts.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy28-sec-0008"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy28-sec-0008-title"> The elections to the regional assembly of Madeira on 9 October 2011</h2>
         
         <p>The so‐called ‘<i>buraco</i>’ (hole) in the financial accounting of Madeira became a very important topic in the elections to the autonomous regional elections. The longevity of the presidency of Alberto João Jardim and the absolute majority of the Social Democrats since 1979 became part of a negative perception of fiscal and financial governance in Madeira, which was used by the opposition against the incumbent government. The relationship of Jardim with the government in Lisbon deteriorated during the finance crisis. The elections led to heavy losses for Jardim and the Social Democrats. Nevertheless, he was still able to hold on to an absolute majority. Jardim announced that this was his last term of office before retiring. The outcome of the election led to a more fragmented regional assembly because some small parties were able to make gains. However, the main party of the opposition, the Socialists, were not able to profit from the bad performance of the regional government. The CDS‐PP became the second largest party, so it can be considered the big winner of election night. Apart from the PSD, the big loser of the night was the Left Bloc, which lost its single seat.
