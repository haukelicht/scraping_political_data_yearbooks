         <p>The year 2008 was dominated by arguments about the economy and climate change. The essential difference between the two cases is that the economic policies of the Rudd Government changed dramatically with the change in the global economy. By contrast their position on climate change remained essentially constant throughout. When he took office late in 2007, the first decision taken by Rudd was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Thereafter it was a case of working through the specifics of the policy before presenting legislation to Parliament for approval. As at the end of 2008 no legislation had been presented. The first legislation on climate change is likely to consume much parliamentary time during the first half of 2009.</p>

         <p>Professor Ross Garnaut is one of Australia's most distinguished and well‐known economists. The <i>Garnaut Climate Change Review</i> was initiated in April 2007 by the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, and by the Premiers of the six states and the Chief Ministers of the two territories of Australia, all of whom were Labor. The Commonwealth Government joined the review in January 2008 after Mr Rudd became Prime Minister, meaning that every government in the country was run by Labor.

         <p>In July the <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Rudd Government</a></span> issued its initial thoughts in the form of <i>Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Green Paper</i>. Its three authors were shown to be Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Treasurer Wayne Swan and the Minister for Climate Change, Senator Penny Wong. It left no‐one in any doubt that its authors considered climate change to be a man made problem and one that needed to be tackled urgently via an emissions trading scheme.
         </p>
         
         <p>Early in September came the 634‐page <i>Garnaut Climate Change Review: Final Report</i>. It was praised by Sir Nicholas Stern (author of its British equivalent) as follows:

<p>The <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Garnaut Review</a></span> is of special importance in its combination of a global view and the perspective from one country. It adopts a way forward for global action on climate change and how Australia can and should manage its own role. At the same time it deepens the shared analytical basis for action. It is a great achievement.</p>

         <p>The gist of local commentary on the Garnaut review was that the size of Australia's climate change mitigation must be proportionate to the solution the world embraces, or fails to embrace, at the Copenhagen conference towards the end of 2009. The purpose of his report was to get the focus where it should be – on a global agreement – there being no such thing as an Australian solution. The interesting feature of the debate is the simple fact that the delay between Garnaut's final report and the Government's response was exactly the same period during which the world's economy deteriorated. This affected public opinion. Opinion polls showed a marked jump in the number of Australians saying they were against an emissions trading scheme or that they wanted it delayed.</p>
         
         <p>When the Rudd Government's response came in mid‐December many observers were shocked at its conservatism. The announced greenhouse gas reduction targets were modest and were accompanied by generous compensation for industry and households. Rudd made an unconditional promise to reduce Australian emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. However, if other major emitters – including developing countries such as India and China – signed on to substantial emission cuts in a United Nations agreement in Copenhagen, Australia could cut its greenhouse pollution by up to 15 per cent by 2020.</p>
         
         <p>A typical comment was made by <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Paul Kelly</a></span> of <i>The Australian</i> newspaper:

<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>This was the only way Australia was going to price carbon: with huge household compensation, help for trade‐exposed industry, a modest absolute target equating to an ambitious per capita target and locking our effort into the global agenda. . . . Like every successful PM, Rudd is pragmatic. He doesn't pretend that Australia can save the world. He won't jeopardise Australia's interests by offering binding cuts unreplicated by others. And he refuses to privilege climate change science with an absolute command of public policy.</p>
<p>Rudd's unconditional reduction target of 5 per cent by 2020 off 2000 levels with an option to lift to a 15 per cent reduction constitutes the policy balance the Australian community expects from its leaders.</p>

         <p>The year began with inflation being the big threat to the economy. It ended with a recession looming. After ten successive increases in interest rates under the Howard Government, the Reserve Bank brought down three more in the early period of the Rudd Government, so that rates peaked in June. Both the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and the Finance Minister, Lindsay Tanner, would regularly warn about the need to restrain spending and keep the budget in a healthy surplus. In the May budget, the estimated surplus was 1.8 per cent of GDP.</p>
         
         <p>Then, in August, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, started to give hints that interest rates may now need to fall because of the slowing economy. At its September meeting, the bank made a small cut in rates. At each of its meetings in October, November and December the bank cut rates by a full 1 per cent. The bank indicated also the possibility of further cuts in 2009. Essentially the Reserve Bank signalled it would do whatever it takes to keep the Australian economy from sliding into the recession caused by the global financial crisis.</p>
         
         <p>The Rudd Government followed the bank's lead. In mid‐October it released its first stimulus package, which came with the suggestion that there may be another early in 2009. Thus the opening story on Wednesday, 15 October was:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>The Rudd Government has plundered the budget surplus by $10.4 billion and given it to pensioners, families and first‐home buyers in an effort to shield the economy against the looming global recession . . . </p>
<p>A week after the Reserve Bank cut interest rates by one percentage point to stimulate the economy, the Government followed suit by spending almost half the forecast $21.7 billion budget surplus, of which $4.8 billion will be given to pensioners in one‐off bonuses before Christmas. From December 8 single pensioners, carers and seniors will receive $1400 each, and each pensioner, carer and senior couple will receive $2100.</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>
            
         
         
         <p>These measures were well received, but one decision made by the Government in October was not popular. Following a worldwide trend established by the Irish Government, the Australian Government introduced a bank deposit guarantee. This had the effect that many people with deposits at non‐bank institutions wanted to withdraw their funds. To stop the run on such funds they needed to prevent withdrawals, thus leading to disappointment for depositors.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Afghanistan and Iraq</h2>
         
         <p>During 2008 three Australian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. However, in accordance with longstanding Labor policy, the Rudd Government withdrew Australian troops from Iraq. When 600 were withdrawn in June it was estimated that some 14,000 had served in Iraq at some stage during the five years of Australia's commitment. Only two deaths occurred in that period. The commitment cost AUS$2.3 billion. Australia continues to keep some 100 military personnel in Baghdad to protect the Australian Embassy.</p>

         <p>The reason Howard went down to electoral defeat was his insistence that Parliament pass the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2006</a></span>: 1038–1039). It was therefore a defeat that was essentially self‐inflicted. He did not need to lose. He lost by inflicting Work Choices on the public and, therefore, on himself in an electoral sense. In 2008 this view became the conventional wisdom, so much so that even senior former ministers in the Howard Government would agree. In December 2007 the Shadow Cabinet declared Work Choices dead and in 2008 Labor had a field day dismantling Work Choices. This was done in two stages, the first being passed in April. The second piece of legislation, the Fair Work Bill, was lying on the table at year's end. The Liberal Party, meanwhile, tied itself up in knots trying to decide whether Labor had a mandate for the Fair Work Bill. If so, it would be allowed to pass the Senate. If not, the other view would prevail. This was best expressed by Victorian Liberal Senator Mitch Fifield who called on the Coalition to abandon its commitment to respect Labor's mandate on industrial relations, arguing the Opposition

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss6"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss6-title"> Official apology to the Stolen Generations</h2>
         
         <p>Back in August 1995 the Keating Labor Government established an inquiry designed, among other things, to ‘trace the past laws, practices and policies which resulted in the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families by compulsion, duress or undue influence, and the effect of those laws, practices and policies’. This was a reference to what are known in Australia as the ‘Stolen Generations’. They are the victims of the practices of protection or welfare board and church authorities who took Aboriginal children away from their families and fostered them, or put them in homes or mission dormitories. The motives were a mixture of concern for children at risk and a desire to accelerate the assimilation of Aborigines into the Australian community. Estimates vary wildly, but from the 1920s to the 1960s, between 20,000 and 100,000 children were taken, many never to rediscover their parents. The children were lied to about their origins.</p>
         
         <p>The inquiry, led by former High Court Justice and president of the <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</a></span>, Sir Ronald Wilson, publicised the issue in 1996–1997, with the report titled <i>Bringing Them Home (1997)</i>. The inquiry had a major impact on public awareness of injustices and fired the passion for apology and reconciliation. The trouble was that Paul Keating was no longer Prime Minister. His Government was defeated at the March 1996 general election and John Howard, the new Prime Minister, refused to make the official apology called for in the report. The current generation should not, Howard argued, feel guilt about the actions of previous generations acting with the best of intentions.
         </p>
         
         <p>At every subsequent general election (1998, 2001, 2004 and 2007) the Labor Party promised, if elected, to make the apology called for in <i>Bringing Them Home</i>. To Kevin Rudd, therefore, fell the honour of making the official apology. He was the only subsequent Labor leader to gain the office of Prime Minister and, on the first day of parliamentary sitting in 2008, Tuesday, 12 February, notice was given of a motion to be moved the following day. The motion read:

         <p>The speeches were made the following day, Wednesday, 13 February, and the motion was carried with much cheering and without dissent. Yet in reality there was dissent. Every former Prime Minister was invited to attend and all, except John Howard, did so. Since Howard had been defeated in his own seat of Bennelong at the November 2007 general election, he did not need to decide what to do if still a member of the House of Representatives. However, a dozen of his former colleagues conspicuously absented themselves from Parliament that day.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss7"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss7-title"> Liberal Party leadership contests</h2>
         
         <p>Following the defeat of John Howard in Bennelong and the decision of his deputy Peter Costello not to seek the leadership of the Liberal Party there was a leadership contest on Thursday, 29 November 2007 (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mackerras 2008</a></span>). There were only two candidates: Dr Brendan Nelson, who polled 45 votes, and Mr Malcolm Turnbull, who polled 42 votes. Both men represent wealthy parts of the Sydney metropolitan area. The deputy leadership position was won by Ms Julie Bishop, who represents wealthy parts of the Perth metropolitan area. Although Nelson acquitted himself quite well in various ways, it became increasingly clear that he was not seen by the electorate as an alternative Prime Minister. Consequently there was a challenge and, on Tuesday, 16 September 2008, the vote was 45 for Turnbull and 41 for Nelson.
         </p>
         
         <p>The leadership of the Nationals also needed to be determined as their leader, Mark Vaile, had stood down in the light of the Coalition's defeat and his party's poor performance. He was succeeded by Warren Truss. In July, Vaile resigned his seat of Lyne (NSW) in the House of Representatives. At the end of 2008 the leadership of Labor (Kevin Rudd), the Nationals (Warren Truss) and the Greens (Senator Bob Brown) was identical to what it had been at year's beginning. In the case of Labor, the party's remarkable stability was reflected in the fact that every ministerial position was identical on 1 January 2009 to what it had been on 1 January 2008.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss8"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss8-title"> Resignations of Coalition MPs</h2>
         
         <p>Based on personal observation of lower house by‐elections in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, Australian politicians arguably qualify as the greediest collection of politicians in the Anglosphere. In Anglosphere countries other than Australia these by‐elections are, as often as not, caused by death. In Australia, by contrast, it is very rare these days to have a by‐election, federal or state, caused by a death. By‐elections, of which there are many, are almost always caused by resignations motivated, many Australians believe, by greed.</p>
         
         <p>Since the country's first federal general election in March 1901 there have been 144 federal by‐elections, of which 108 occurred in the period from 1901 to 1981, inclusive. Only 37 of those 108 were caused by the resignation of the member. By contrast, in the period from 1982 to 2008, inclusive, there have been 36 by‐elections, of which 33 were caused by resignation, one by a natural death, one by a suicide death and one by the court of disputed returns voiding the result in a seat at the previous general election. As soon as the Howard Government lost office there was speculation as to which of his ministers would resign their parliamentary seats, but there was, initially at least, a sense of shame among the politicians about this. In part this was caused by the recognition that among the reasons for John Howard's defeat in Bennelong was the local understanding that if he had won, he would surely resign his seat immediately. In any event, the first Howard minister to resign his seat was Peter McGauran, the National Party member for Gippsland in Victoria.</p>
         
         <p>When the Nationals retained Gippsland with surprising ease at the June by‐election the speculation was on as to which others would go. In the event, July saw the resignation of former Foreign Affairs Minister, Liberal Alexander Downer, from his seat of Mayo in South Australia and former Trade Minister, National Mark Vaile, from his seat of Lyne in New South Wales. The date for the by‐elections was set for Saturday, 6 September. As things turned out, Downer was essentially as lucky as McGauran. The Liberal candidate, Jamie Briggs, retained the seat at the by‐election. It was a woefully bad result for the Liberals in a safe seat but, as the saying goes ‘a win is a win’. By contrast, Vaile gained what some critics saw as his just deserts. A popular local Independent member in the state parliament won the seat and the Nationals were humiliated. Then there was the consequent state by‐election on 18 October, which the Nationals thought they might win. They failed again, leaving many party members seething with anger at their former leader. Had he followed the example of the two previous leaders of the Nationals, Tim Fischer in 2001 and John Anderson in 2007, who retired at the expiration of their parliamentary terms having resigned the leadership more than a year earlier, Vaile would have saved the taxpayer the cost of two by‐elections – and saved his party considerable humiliation.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss9"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss9-title"> The Australian States and Territories</h2>
         
         <p>New South Wales was the state with the most interesting politics in 2008. Governed by Labor since 1995, it has had three premiers of that party: Bob Carr from March 1995, Morris Iemma from August 2005 and Nathan Rees from September 2008. Carr had won three general elections, in each of March 1995, 1999 and 2003. Iemma had a single victory, in March 2007. Rees is very unlikely ever to win a general election, the next one being fixed for March 2011.</p>
         
         <p>Iemma's 2007 win, with a reduced majority, had been an unlikely event. It was owed essentially to the public's reaction against the Work Choices legislation of the Howard Government. With Howard gone by year's end the situation of the NSW Labor Government became terminal. The economy of Australia's largest state went into recession, while the rest of the country stayed firmly out of economic trouble. There seemed to be no fix for the problem, but Iemma thought he had found one. He decided to privatise the state's electricity industry. This was firmly opposed to the policy of the party as determined by its conference. It was also firmly opposed by public opinion. Consequently, on Friday, 5 September, Iemma was replaced as leader by Nathan Rees. Iemma immediately resigned his ultra‐safe seat of Lakemba and a by‐election was held on Saturday, 18 October. Iemma's deputy, John Watkins, also resigned his marginal seat of Ryde, which, as a consequence of its by‐election on the same day, is now a safe Liberal seat.</p>
         
         <p>When Kevin Rudd swept to office it was widely believed that the situation of Labor‐only governments would last all the way until the expected defeat of the New South Wales Labor Government in 2011. This expectation, however, proved to be wrong. The state with the strongest economy of all (Western Australia) produced a surprise change of government at an early election on 6 September. Labor Premier Alan Carpenter thought he had the election won when he called the early election to capitalise on the Liberal Party's leadership woes. However, the public dislikes such cynical maneuvers as calling an early election for such a reason. After a bad campaign Labor lost, and the new state of the parties in the Legislative Assembly (lower house) is 31 for the conservative combination and 28 for Labor. The conservative combination consists of 24 Liberals, four Nationals and three Independents.</p>
         
         <p>Given the time taken for the counting of votes in several very close seats, the new premier, Colin Barnett (Liberal), was sworn in on Tuesday, 23 September. The ministry now consists of 13 Liberals, three Nationals and one of the Independents. The Legislative Assembly of Western Australia is elected by a non‐proportional system of single‐member constituencies with preferential voting and no rural weighting. By contrast, the Legislative Council (upper house) is elected by a semi‐proportional system with multimember constituencies and a rural weighting. That election saw the return of 16 Liberals, 11 Labor, five Nationals and four Greens.</p>
         
         <p>Australia's least populous state is Tasmania and it, too, produced a change in the office of premier. Labor's Paul Lennon had been strongly supporting the construction of a new pulp mill in the state's north, which was strongly opposed by the Greens and various environmentalists. On 26 May he resigned and the new Premier is David Bartlett. Lennon also resigned his seat in the House of Assembly. However, this did not produce a by‐election. Tasmania's electoral system is known here as Hare‐Clark and is essentially the same as that of Ireland (known there as ‘Proportional Representation by Means of the Single Transferable Vote’). There is a difference, however. Whereas in Ireland a vacancy is filled through a by‐election, or fresh poll of the electorate, in Tasmania it is filled by counting out the quota of votes of the departed member. So Lennon's resignation made no difference to the state of the parties, which stays at 14 Labor, seven Liberals and four for the Greens. Sometime in 2009 we shall, no doubt, learn whether the pulp mill goes ahead.</p>
         
         <p>The two territories are Australia's least populous jurisdictions. Each had a general election in 2008: the Northern Territory on 9 August and the Australian Capital Territory on 18 October – both being Saturdays since all elections in Australia are held on a Saturday. In the Northern Territory, Labor was returned with a reduced majority. In the Australian Capital Territory (in effect, the city of Canberra), Labor was also returned – but in a minority situation. In the 17‐seat Legislative Assembly, the state of parties now is seven Labor, six Liberals and four for the Greens. This was the best result for the Greens since they started contesting Australian elections a generation ago. It shows how well the Greens can perform when they have proportional representation to help them, with the system in this case being the same as that in Tasmania.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss10"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss10-title"> Conclusion</h2>
         
         <p>At the end of the year the Rudd Government was riding high in all the opinion polls. In terms of preferred Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd was well ahead of Malcolm Turnbull, typically preferred by a margin of three to one. However, there was still some uncertainty about who would win the next general election, likely to be held about October 2010. It is true that one needs to go back to December 1931 to find a case of a government defeated after only one term. On that basis, 2010 would see Rudd winning a second election. On the other hand, 2009 is likely to see Australia slip into recession and the budgetary position change from surplus to deficit. In such a circumstance it would be unwise to make any predictions, at this stage at least, for the 2010 event.</p>
