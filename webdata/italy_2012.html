         <p>The year 2012 abounded in startling events which changed the shape of the domestic political landscape. Among those were: the left parties’ primaries for the selection of the mayoral candidates in some important cities and the subsequent local elections; the corruption scandals of former party treasurers of the Northern League (Lega Nord, LN) and the – by now extinct – Daisy (Margherita) party; the organisational and political crisis of the Lega Nord and its change of leadership; the primary within the centre‐left parties for the prime ministerial candidate; the emergence of the Five Stars Movement (Movimento 5 Stelle, M5S) led by former comedian Beppe Grillo; and the unaccounted resignation of the Monti Government.</p>

         <p>At the beginning of the year, the new government, led by the former EU Commissioner and renowned economist Mario Monti (installed at the end of 2011 after the collapse of the Berlusconi Government in the face of the economic‐financial crisis) still benefitted from the aura of ‘homeland rescuer’. The initial tough reforms of the pension systems and market liberalisation, later followed by reform of the labour market, passed with the agreement of the three parties – People of Freedom (PdL), Democratic Party (PD), and Democratic Centre Union (UDC) – which supported the coalition with considerable public consent. Only the new property tax caused concern and protest, not only because it was a tax difficult to evade (and the Court of Accounts estimated that the cost of corruption and evasion in Italy amounts to €200 billion each year), but also because it re‐introduced a tax that the Berlusconi Government had abolished. Furthermore, it deprived local councils of an important source of income since it was entirely devolved to the central fiscal administration in a period of limited money transfers from the centre to the periphery.</p>
         
         <p>As the year progressed the government lost most of its reformist impetus, both because of the intrinsic political limits and <i>naiveté</i> of its technocratic imprint, and because of the growing impatience of the ‘strange’ coalition which sustained it. After the summer break there were rumours of a new election in the autumn but no one took the lead in this regard. At the end of the year the situation changed. In response to a government bill on corruption, which the PdL opposed, the party's secretary, Angelino Alfano, announced that the Monti Government ‘was over’. Alfano's statement was thought to reflect the impulse of Silvio Berlusconi who had come back with a vengeance in daily politics after having, throughout the year, advocated the mere role of senior adviser for himself. Prime Minister Mario Monti reacted in an unexpected way: contrary to the general expectation, he refused to seek a deal and resigned on December 16, with the consequent, inevitable, call for new elections.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the spring, local elections in some major cities were held. The main party of left, the PD, revealed its weakness in the process of candidate selection for the mayorship through open primaries. In most of the cities the more radical candidate, and not the one backed by the PD, won the primaries and then went on to win the elections. The PD suffered a blow because in the largest cities – with the exception of Turin – most of the party's candidates did not gain the nomination (whereas in all the minor cities they passed). However, because the PD was by far the largest component of the left coalition, it entered the government in the local city councils with many party representatives.</p>
         
         <p>In those elections a more dramatic weakness was revealed by the right‐wing parties, PdL and the Lega Nord. The PdL, temporarily the orphan of its founding father, Berlusconi, scored very poorly. Even worse was the outcome for the Lega Nord. This party had reached its height just the previous year thanks to a series of positive results at regional and local elections. However, the disclosure of the amazing dimension of the malfeasance and corruption of the Lega treasurer (trafficking of diamonds and gold, investments in Africa and Cyprus, distribution of generous pocket money to some party officials and so on) provoked a fatal backlash for a party which had always presented itself as pure and close to the ordinary people. The most damaging element of the disclosure was revelations of complicity by the son of the party leader, Umberto Bossi. This issue went beyond a mere family question because Bossi's son – already regional councillor in Lombardy despite his very young age – was repeatedly identified by his father as the party <i>dauphin</i>. The scandal also directly affected the party leadership. Umberto Bossi resigned after more than 20 years of uncontested reign over the Lega, and on July 30 Roberto Maroni was elected party leader amid clashes between Bossi's diehard supporters and the so‐called ‘renovators’.
         </p>
         
         <p>Scandals linked to party financing did not affect the Lega only. Luigi Lusi, the former treasurer of the now disappeared Daisy, was found guilty of illicit personal expenditure of the party money. What had the greatest impact on public opinion was the amount of money that Lusi had taken for his personal use (houses, jewels, luxury vacations, lucullian dinners and so on). In addition, investigation into this scandal revealed another malpractice widely ignored by the public: even a defunct party such as the Daisy (which had merged with the Democrats of the Left (DS) into the new party PD in 2007) still had a virtual existence, with a budget not devolved to the new party but kept for the disposal of the former Daisy leaders.</p>
         
         <p>Later on, other cases of corruption and illegal financing emerged. The leader of the PdL party group in the Latium regional assembly was found guilty of malfeasance. Similar charges – even if of minor entities – were raised against the regional president and many right‐wing regional councillors in Lombardy. The disclosures of the abundance of money in the hands of political representatives, and its abuse, brought about the dissolution of the Latium and Lombardy regional councils in the late autumn.</p>
         
         <p>These scandals raised a furore against political parties. In a period of austerity the image of politicians with millions in their pockets and a luxurious lifestyle inflamed an already widespread anti‐party sentiment. At the end of the year fewer than 10 per cent of survey respondents expressed confidence in political parties.</p>
         
         <p>A new political actor exploited this sentiment: the Movimento 5 Stelle. This movement had already been active for several years mainly through, and thanks to, the Internet, and more particularly the blog of the former comedian Beppe Grillo, who had one of the most visited political blogs in the world. The movement was particularly active in environmental and ‘citizens’ rights’ issues; precisely for these features it resembled the German <i>Burgerinitiviativen</i> and the primordial stages of the German Greens. The M5S has no formal organization: it gathers its militants in meet‐ups and develops its contact network through the blog. The M5S has started presenting lists of candidates in local and regional elections in the last five years, and made a breakthrough in the 2010 regional election in Emilia‐Romagna, where it got a sizeable 7 per cent in a traditionally ‘difficult’ region for newcomers.
         </p>
         
         <p>The movement gained strong momentum with the unexpected election of its young mayoral candidate in the medium‐sized city of Parma. The M5S candidate made it past the first round of balloting with a meagre 19.9 per cent, but then defeated his leftist opponent in the second ballot with a resounding 60.1 per cent – thanks in part to the right‐wing voters who joined him to defeat the left. This success, together with the political‐financial scandals and the loss of attractiveness of the Monti Government's technocrats, boosted the M5S. At the regional election in Sicily, in October, the leader Beppe Grillo, aged 64, invested all his energy into the political campaign (contrary to the other parties’ national leaders), beginning with a spectacular 3.2 kilometre swim between mainland Italy and Sicily, reminiscent in some way of Garibaldi's landing of the Mille. As a result, the M5S scored 19.5 per cent and became the largest party in the region, following a historically low turnout of 47.4 per cent. The vocal anti‐party and anti‐establishment polemic by the M5S does not place it in the neo‐populist right‐wing category: beyond a widespread euroscepticism, it is attentive to civil right issues, it invokes ‘radical’ respect for the rule of law and it fosters social provisions. On the other hand, the dominant figure of Grillo and his personal control of the website contradict the repeated declarations of equality within the movement. The slogan ‘one counts for one’ clashes with the reality of a charismatic leadership.</p>
         
         <p>A further salient moment in the political year was represented by the primary contest for the selection of the prime ministerial candidate of the centre‐left front. The dominant party of the coalition, the PD, according to its statutory process identified party secretary Pierluigi Bersani as its candidate for the premiership. However, the young and ambitious mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi, contested this rule and asked for a change by opening up the competition through open primaries. Bersani accepted the challenge and changed the statute accordingly (and he even had to convince many of his supporters to vote for this change). The challenge lasted for the entire autumn, and even though it created deep fissures in the party between the two sides – other candidates found little traction – it attracted so much attention that it benefitted the party. In the opinion polls at the end of the primaries the PD reached a never‐before‐attained 40 per cent support. A confirmation of the success of this heated confrontation came from the 3.1 million people who participated in the PD primary in the first ballot and the 2.8 million at the second ballot. Bersani won the second ballot against Renzi with 61.1 per cent of votes. Although Renzi did not win, he contributed to the appeal of the competition, and the PD benefited from the eruption of this new figure, who is only 38 years‐old, brilliant and outspoken, very telegenic and with an innovative liberal‐reformist discourse.</p>

         <p>On 12 April, Article 81 of the Constitution was changed, introducing parity in the state budget balance in revenues and expenditures. This rule, approved in accordance with European Union suggestions, was supported by the pro‐government parties (PdL, PD, UDC). It passed with a two‐thirds majority in both chambers. This large majority prohibits the possibility of calling a referendum to abolish the new article.</p>
