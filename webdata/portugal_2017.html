         <p>One major economic achievement of the Socialist government of Antonio Costa was to leave the excessive deficit procedure imposed by the European Commission and gain more autonomy in economic policy. However, this was overshadowed by the mismanagement of the fires by the government throughout Portugal during the summer, leading to over 100 dead and 270 injured. Prime Minister Antonio Costa was under considerable criticism from the President of the Republic Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, and public opinion.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12221-sec-0020-title"> Election report</h2>
         
         <p>The local elections of October 2017 were an important first major test for the Costa government which was almost completing its second year in government. Opinion polls predicted a very strong showing of the Socialist Party (PS). In this context, the local elections focused mainly on local issues, and had only a very peripheral impact on national politics.</p>
         
         <p>The overall results confirmed the predictions of the opinion polls throughout the campaign. The PS held on to its councils and made some wins, while its rival Social Democratic Party (PSD) lost seven councils. This clearly was a major wake‐up call for the main opposition party, which clearly was not doing well under the leadership of former Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho. The defeat led to the end of his chairmanship and the beginning of a leadership contest. The Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), once with a stronghold in local government in the southern region of Alentejo, lost control over further councils. Apart from the PS, the big winner were the Citizens’ Groups, which held 20 councils.</p>
         
         <p>Quite important were the results in the two main cities. Prime Minister Costa had been mayor of Lisbon before returning to national politics. His Deputy President Fernando Medina took over as new mayor of Lisbon in 2015. He kept his incumbency as mayor by forming a coalition with the Block of the Left (BE). In Porto, the independent Rui Moreira, supported by the Democratic Social Centre‐People's Party (CDS‐PP), repeated his victory of 2013 with 39 per cent of the vote. After the elections, he could count on the support of the right‐of‐centre PSD.</p>

         <p>The Costa minority government was quite able to steer its programme with the help of the left‐wing parties the PCP and the BE throughout the year. This was due to the very strong negotiation skills of the Prime Minister. The main aim of the Costa government was to leave the excessive deficit procedure imposed by the European Commission in the early phase of the euro and sovereign debt crisis (see Issues in politics).</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the year, the cabinet had to be reshuffled several times. Most of these reshuffles were at the state secretary (junior minister) level. These junior‐level reshuffles took place on 6 February (one change), 14 July (eight changes) and 12 December 2017 (one change). The most relevant was on 14 July, which replaced three secretaries of state who were now indicted as having accepted illicitly tickets and travel to the finals of the European football championships from the major energy national company GALP and were awaiting trial. This so‐called ‘Galpgate’ was a major issue that had affected the government in the previous year. Prime Minister Costa lost one of his strongest allies in Fernando Rocha Andrade who was Secretary of State for Fiscal Affairs, which also included the handling of tax disputes with the GALP.</p>
         
         <p>Apart from these three junior‐level reshuffles, the Minister for Internal Administration, Constança Urbano de Sousa, resigned in October 2017 and was replaced by the previously Joint Minister Eduardo Cabrita, a strong ally of Costa. Urbano de Sousa's position had become untenable after the mismanagement of the devastating fires during the summer when, on 17 June 2017, 65 people died and 200 were injured in Pedrogão Grande, located in the south‐east of Coimbra. Unfortunately, such a tragedy happened again on 14–16 October, leading to 45 dead and 70 injured. In total, over 100 people died in the fires in 2017. The President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, explicitly asked for the resignation of minister Urbano de Sousa. On 12 October, a devastating independent report commissioned by the government detailed the scale of mismanagement and inadequate structures to deal with these situations. This led to institutional tensions between President of the Republic Rebelo de Sousa and Prime Minister Costa after almost two years of good relations.</p>

         <p>The Socialist minority government could rely on the support of the two left‐wing opposition parties, the PCP and the BE. However, their demands for more redistribution and other social policies increased, in spite of the government's still‐very‐small margin for additional expenditure due to the pressure of the European Commission for fiscal containment.</p>
         
         <p>Quite early in the year, the government suffered a major defeat in Parliament related to the agreement achieved in the Permanent Social Concertation Council (CPCS). The agreement would allow the minimum wage to be raised from €530 to €557 per month, but simultaneously reduce the social contributions of enterprises by 1.25 per cent. The PS counted on the support of the PSD without having discussed previously with the main opposition party. Therefore, the main leader of the opposition, Pedro Passos Coelho, decided to reject the agreement in Parliament jointly with the left‐wing opposition parties. This was a major miscalculation by Prime Minister Costa and also for President Rebelo de Sousa who had invested in negotiations in order to achieve this. In the end, the government decided to compensate the enterprises by reclaiming the equivalent extra costs through a discount of business taxes at the end of the year.</p>
         
         <p>Also early in the year, Parliament was very keen to investigate email exchanges between Finance Minister Mário Centeno and the ex‐director of the state bank Caixa Geral de Depósitos Antonio Domingues during 2016. In the email exchange, but also in letters by Domingues, it seems that Centeno accepted the conditions of the former director to become the new director of the public bank, which contravened the regulations of the Statute of the Public Manager of 2007. Among the regulations, which Domingues did not want to fulfil, were the obligations on him and his team to disclose their income and interests, and limits to their wages. According to the opposition, Centeno lied to Parliament and therefore should resign. In spite of a parliamentary inquest commission, both the Prime Minister and the President were very keen to prevent Centeno's resignation due to the need to keep stability in the finance policy of the country due to the forthcoming possibility of leaving the excessive deficit procedure. In the end, the whole issue lost steam and Centeno survived this first challenge in his office.</p>
         
         <p>As mentioned in previous issues, Portuguese political parties are quite in debt, in spite of receiving considerable public funding for the parliamentary groups and electoral campaigns. Over a period of nine months, political parties negotiated changes to the law of party financing. Finally, on 21 December 2017, the new law was adopted with the votes of the PS, the PSD, the Portuguese Communist Party‐Party the Greens (PCP‐PEV) and the BE. The CDS‐PP and the Party of Animals and Nature (PAN) voted against. Although the new law did not envisage an increase of funding for the political parties, the PS and the PSD were very keen to obtain the reimbursement of the value added tax for everything they may acquire. Moreover, the new law envisaged retroactive reimbursement from previous campaigns. Added to this, a more liberal approach to raising private funding was included. Furthermore, the new law intended to strengthen the competences of the Entity for the Accounting and Financing of Political Parties (<i>Entidade de Contas e Financiamentos dos Partidos Politicos – ECFPP</i>) giving the right to issue penalties for non‐compliance. If political parties disagree, they can file a complaint with the Constitutional Court. However, allegedly no extra funding or personnel would be allocated to the ECFPP, so that it would be quite constrained in its ability to check the political parties. Currently, the ECFPP reviews the annual and electoral reports of the political parties and issues an opinion, which is then taken up by the Constitutional Court which then issues a ruling on the matter. However, the reality is that the Constitutional Court had difficulty catching up with the reporting of the political parties, so there has been a backlog of reviews for reports since 2009. The lack of transparency around the process of the negotiations led to a general suspicion that the political parties united like a cartel and made concessions to each other in order to get the law approved.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, it was rumoured that President Rebelo de Sousa would veto the law and send it back to Parliament to revise it.</p>

         <p>In the autumn the negotiations for the budget of 2018 started between the political parties, particularly those of the left. Finance Minister Mário Centeno tried to play with the very narrow margin that he had to negotiate with the two left‐wing opposition parties that were supporting the government. There was pressure for further redistribution policies and the restoration of pre‐Troika conditions of public sector employees. One particular measure was to end the freezing of progression and promotion of civil servants and teachers in the public sector. Due to the fact that not enough funding was available for a general restoration and retroactive payment of past obligations, it was agreed to achieve this in four phases in 2018 and 2019. Moreover, the new budget also changed slightly the tax brackets, creating additional ones, and increasing the number of poor households exempt from paying taxes. Furthermore, it was agreed to transform a large number of state employees who were in a precarious employment relationship into permanent employees, particularly among teachers. This would also happen over a lengthier period of time. Employers organizations were rather disappointed with the budget, which tended to burden the enterprises even further by reducing flexibility in the payment of extra holidays and Christmas payments (13th and 14th wages). The budget was approved with the votes of the left parties (PS, PCP‐PEV, BE) and was opposed by the centre‐right parties (PSD, CDS‐PP).</p>

         <p>After the defeat in the local elections of 1 October, the leader of the PSD, Pedro Passos Coelho, decided to resign and, so doing, opened the way for a leadership contest. The most likely successor was the former mayor of Oporto, Rui Rio. Also, former Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes decided to enter the race. The results of the primaries among the members of the party would only be known on 13 January 2018.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> The top priority: leaving the excessive deficit procedure</h3>
            
            <p>The main aim for the year was to leave the excessive deficit procedure introduced by the European Commission in the early phase of the euro and sovereign debt crisis, back in 2009. Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economy, already gave strong signs that this would happen in April of that year. One main reason is that the budget deficit had decreased from 4.4 per cent in 2015 to 2.0 per cent in 2016, better than the forecasts of both the European Commission and the government of 2.4 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Moreover, in 2017, the government predicted a deficit of 1.5 per cent, although at the end of the year it may even be 1.0 per cent. This was a great achievement for Finance Minister Mario Centeno who had full control over the spending of the ministries and was able to achieve this result. Indeed, on 5 April, Portugal left the excessive budget procedure and gained more economic and financial autonomy. Such a result was achieved because the economy grew by more than expected. According to the Bank of Portugal, the Portuguese economy grew by 2.6 per cent, slightly above the average of the Euro area of 2.5 per cent. Unemployment went further down from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent throughout the year.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Mario Centeno as new President of the Eurogroup</h3>
            
            <p>This impressive achievement earned much admiration among Centeno's colleagues in the Eurogroup. The heavy loss of the Labour Party in the Netherlands in the general elections of 15 March 2017 led to a weakening of the position of then President of Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Moreover, controversial remarks about the Southern Europeans in an interview in the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine</i> on 19 March 2017 led to calls in the European Socialist Party for him to resign. Dijsselbloem had been elected for two years in 2016, but the fact that he would no longer be Finance Minister in the new Mark Rutte government weakened his position considerably. However, the long negotiations for a new coalition government in the Netherlands that took most of the year allowed Dijsselbloem to remain the incumbent of the presidency. Nevertheless, since April, the search for a new President of the Eurogroup had started. Centeno was able to position himself as one possible candidate. Due to the very skilled negotiation abilities by Prime Minister Costa, who got on board French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as well as the support of the finance ministers of Socialist‐led governments, Centeno was appointed as the new President on 4 December 2017. His rivals, the Latvian, Luxembourg and Slovakian finance ministers Dania Reizniece‐Ozola, Pierre Gramegna and Peter Kazimir respectively, could not achieve a majority of the votes. This was an excellent achievement for the Portuguese government, although the left‐wing opposition parties, the BE and PCP‐PEV, were afraid that this may harm the redistributive policies on which they had agreed. Also, President Rebelo de Sousa feared that the domestic work may be neglected by the extra function that Centeno took on.

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Mismanagement of the fires</h3>
            
            <p>Probably the most important topic of the year was the mismanagement of the annual fires season between June and October. Portugal is one of the most vulnerable European Union member states for forest fires during the summer. Various reasons account for this. Apart from the high temperatures during the summer, Portugal has a chronic lack of water resources, which has led to drought for several years. Moreover, climate change may play an important role, further exacerbating a difficult situation. Furthermore, there is no real proper management of the forest because a large part is situated on private land. This is reinforced by the fact that an updated land register is non‐existent.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, on 16–17 June, 65 people died and more than 200 were injured when they tried to flee the flames in their cars on the roads of Pedrogão O Grande in the south‐east of Coimbra. Again, on 15 October, a further 48 died and 70 were injured in devastating fires, particularly around Marinha Grande, on the coast between Lisbon and Coimbra. The official period of fire alert, the so‐called ‘phase Charlie’, runs between 1 July and 30 September. In this period, quite a considerable amount of human and material resources are available to combat the fires. Nevertheless, the two fire periods happened before and after ‘phase Charlie’ and, in spite of warnings by the national Meteorology, Sea and Atmosphere Institute (IPMA), the government did not reinforce the resources for the respective regions. They reacted far too late and in a non‐organized way. Moreover, SIRESP, a national warning and communication system for emergency cases like fires, was not up to standards. One basic mistake was to use communication masts throughout the forest without leaving a proper distance to the trees. Therefore, the masts were devastated by the fires, interrupting any communication. It seems that helicopters and planes to combat the flames were not properly located in the territory. A report about the fire of the Pedrogão O Grande highlighted all these failures that led to the tragedy (for more detail, see Comissão Técnica Independente <span><a href="#epdy12221-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12221-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>, <span><a href="#epdy12221-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12221-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2018</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>As already mentioned, the Minister of Internal Administration, Constança Urbano de Sousa, who had also mismanaged the fire season in 2016, was forced to resign by President Rebelo de Sousa. Rebelo de Sousa was quite empathic and sympathetic to the victims by travelling several times during the second half of the year, including Christmas, to the sites where the fires occurred. The relationship between the President of the Republic and Prime Minister remained tense during the rest of the year because at the beginning the Prime Minister did not want to extra‐judicially fast‐track compensation funding for the victims. In the end, Finance Minister Centeno was forced to find enough funding for distribution among the victims in the budget of 2018. Most immediate support came from civil society organizations and insurances.</p>
            
            <p>The victims of fires in both regions decided to file a law suit against the state due to negligence in their duty to protect the population. Moreover, on 24 October in Parliament, the CDS‐PP put forward a motion of censure against the Prime Minister and the government, which was rejected with 122 votes of the PC, PCP, Bloquistas and PAN, whereas 105 votes of CDS‐PP and PSD were in favour.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> The government high in the opinion polls</h3>
            
            <p>In spite of these two tragedies, the Socialists remained quite high in the opinion polls, reaching between 37 per cent and 40 per cent throughout the year, while the PSD between 27 per cent and 30 per cent. Among the smaller parties, the BE had 8–9 per cent, the PCP had 7–8 per cent, the CDS‐PP had 6–7 per cent and PAN had 1–2 per cent. This clearly was quite problematic for the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, who clearly were not very competitive, in spite of the mismanagement of the fires.</p>
