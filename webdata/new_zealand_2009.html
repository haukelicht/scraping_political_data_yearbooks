      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss1"><p>MP scandals dominated New Zealand politics in 2010 – especially those relating to political finance and what might be broadly categorised as ‘MP expenses’. Most notably, five MPs suffered severe political consequences for their various indiscretions, while others merely damaged their reputations. In addition, the year was characterised by two national disasters, continued economic recession and a very popular government.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Scandals in politics</h2>
         
         <p>The major political scandal of the year was not related to money but instead to the criminal past of a hard‐line law and order politician. David Garrett, a maverick socially conservative ACT Party MP, resigned from parliament in September after revelations of his criminal past. First it was revealed that he had an assault conviction from a 2002 bar brawl, but then the explosive revelation emerged that in 1984 he had obtained a bogus passport by stealing a dead baby's identity. Garrett made the following statement to parliament to explain his past misdemeanour:</p>
         
         <p>
            
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>Using a method made known by the publication of the novel <i>The Day of the Jackal</i>, I obtained the birth certificate of a child born at around the time I was born, but who had died in infancy. I used this birth certificate to obtain a passport in that child's name. To this day I cannot explain the rationale behind my actions, except to say I was simply curious to see whether such a thing could be done.</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>
            
         
         
         <p>Garrett was replaced in parliament by the next person on the ACT Party list, Hilary Calvert.</p>
         
         <p>Most other significant scandals in politics related to the increased focus on MP and ministerial expenses – partly brought about by the 2009 news of the British MP expenses scandal. It seems that the earthquake of public outrage in the United Kingdom eventually created a tsunami of focus on the pay, allowances and entitlements of cabinet ministers and ordinary MPs in New Zealand. Starting in 2009 with a focus on MP housing entitlements, the media and public became highly sensitive to the possibilities of politicians rorting the system and making pecuniary gains through politics.</p>
         
         <p>The first expenses scandal of 2010 came in February when the credit card spending details of cabinet ministers were released to the media (who had made requests under the Official Information Act). The Minister of Housing and of Fisheries, Phil Heatley, resigned his ministerial warrant when attention was drawn to his personal use of a ministerial credit card to pay for spending on alcohol, takeaways and a family holiday. The Auditor General investigated, and the following month Heatley was partially cleared, allowing him to return as a minister.</p>
         
         <p>Cabinet minister Pansy Wong also fell victim to the new focus on the political probity of politicians. In November it was revealed that her husband had conducted private business activities on a taxpayer‐funded holiday to China. Political opponents alleged numerous other breaches of the rules, and Wong resigned, first from cabinet and then from parliament.</p>
         
         <p>During the year the focus on ministerial behaviour shifted to a retrospective look at the spending details of ministers from the previous Labour Government, with the National Party Prime Minister agreeing to release the credit card records of ministers going back to 2002. As a result, there were all sorts of sensational detail about most previous ministers, but the most damaging was to previous Labour ministers Shane Jones, Chris Carter and Mita Ririnui – all of whom were subsequently demoted by party leader Phil Goff.</p>
         
         <p>Shane Jones earned the most humiliation, as he had apparently made a habit of using his ministerial credit card to pay to view hotel pornographic films. Jones publicly expressed strong regret – which was relatively well received – but his apparent ambitions to eventually become Labour leader and prime minister were widely viewed as being dashed by the scandal.</p>
         
         <p>The revelation of Chris Carter's misdemeanours caused much more significant and long‐lasting damage to his career and reputation. Carter appeared unrepentant about his transgressions, and he took exception to his demotion. He created considerable internal problems in the Labour Party, which came to a head when he was exposed as attempting to foment talk amongst the media of a leadership coup in Labour. The former cabinet minister and confidant of previous Prime Minister Helen Clark, was subsequently expelled from both the party caucus and the Labour Party, and remained in parliament as an independent MP.</p>
         
         <p>The perquisites of politicians became increasingly debated throughout the year – especially the generous international travel subsidies available to all MPs and ex‐MPs. The mood of the public was strongly against the continued existence of the perk, which led Prime Minister John Key to pressure the Speaker of Parliament, Lockwood Smith, to pare back the travel perk considerably. Then a report from the Law Commission recommended that the responsibility for all such perks be transferred from parliament to the Remuneration Authority. The politicians unanimously and quickly agreed to the recommendation – illustrating just how sensitive they had become to the public mood on the issue.</p>
         
         <p>The Prime Minister himself was the subject of speculation about his own financial investments after it was alleged by his opponents that the ‘blind trust’ that looked after his multimillion dollar portfolio of assets was in fact open for John Key to monitor. Nothing came of the minor scandal, but the focus on the Prime Minister's personal finances was characteristic of the mood of politics.</p>
         
         <p>Also related to political finance, the Government finally introduced its promised new legislation to regulate political finance and elections, replacing the previous Electoral Finance Act. The new legislation, entitled the Electoral (Finance Reform and Advance Voting) Act, was the result of an extended consultation process with the public and other parliamentary parties. The resulting multiparty legislation was strongly characterised by compromise, and therefore had many similarities with the previous controversial legislation that it replaced.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> The reforms of the National Government</h2>
         
         <p>The National Government's second year in office was relatively active. With a parliamentary term of only three years, New Zealand governments tend to implement most of their reforms in their second year. To some extent this occurred in 2010, with various noteworthy changes enacted, but mostly the Government kept to its declared style of moving only slowly and trying to ‘take the public with it’ on any changes. This did not mean that it was an easy year for National – the Government was confronted with numerous challenges.</p>
         
         <p>The economy, in particular, was sluggish and underperforming, with high unemployment and low economic growth; the manufacturing and retail sectors were particularly flat throughout the year. Controversially, a number of finance companies went into liquidation, including the large South Canterbury Finance Company, which required a government bailout of NZ$1.6 billion. Unsurprisingly, during this time the Government books declined, and with a forecast operating deficit of more than NZ$10 billion, the Government was forced to borrow about NZ$240 million a week throughout the year.</p>
         
         <p>The Government's responses to the continuing economic slump were mostly found in its annual Budget delivered in May. Substantial changes were made in the tax system, bound up in a package referred to as a ‘tax switch’ whereby income tax rates were cut (including the former top rate of 39 per cent) and the comprehensive goods and services tax (GST) was increased from 12.5 to 15 per cent. Loopholes were also closed that previously allowed landlords to claim large tax rebates on their investments.</p>
         
         <p>The GST increase was the major issue – media monitoring shows that it received more media mentions than any other political story during the year. The increase in the tax was sold as being part of a ‘tax switch’ in which income taxes would be cut, with the promise that ‘the vast bulk’ of people would be better off due to the corresponding reduction in income taxes. The Government's opponents made much of the fact that the GST increase broke a pre‐election promise from National and that the whole tax switch amounted to a shift of income from poor to the rich. Yet the change was largely accepted by the public without any obvious backlash.</p>
         
         <p>Government spending cutbacks were also instigated in the public sector, with some government departments making significant reductions in employee numbers. The changes were configured so that the resources were retained by the departments to be transferred ‘from the back office to the frontline’ with the idea that bureaucracy was being reduced in favour of enhanced services for the public. This strategy of supposedly getting ‘better value for money’ for the public service epitomised the Government's approach of carefully making its cutbacks in areas in which there would be the least public concern. This method ensured ongoing high popularity while implementing what previously might have been very unpopular cuts to public expenditure.</p>
         
         <p>The Government also made some significant changes to employment law – in particular extending the 90‐day probation period to all businesses and allowing employees to cash in their fourth week of annual leave. Again, although there were fierce debates in parliament and trade unions threatened action against employers using the provisions, these changes caused relatively little public disquiet.</p>
         
         <p>The Government also sided with employers when a (spectacular) dispute broke out between an actors union and studio producers about the upcoming filming of Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit</i>. The studio bosses threatened to shift production offshore, but the Government intervened, met with executives from the Warner Bros studios, and agreed to change employment laws and to contribute a special additional subsidy to the filming if it stayed in New Zealand. The negotiations were deemed a success and the production remained in the country. The Government's actions appeared to be popular, yet subsequent debate raised issues about whether the public had been misled about the dispute, and about the propriety of letting a multinational negotiate subsidies and employment law.
         </p>
         
         <p>One major area where the Government seriously misread the public mood was in its proposal to allow significant new mining on conservation land, including in iconic spots. The Government attempted to sell the proposal as a means of creating substantial economic growth and revenue for the country, but environmentalists rallied strong public opposition to the idea, and the Government backed down.</p>
         
         <p>Mining was also the cause of a major national tragedy when in December there was an explosion in the Pike River mine on the West Coast of the South Island, killing 29 of 31 miners. The disaster unfolded over many days, and during this time the Prime Minister received kudos for the way he was perceived as handling the disaster.</p>
         
         <p>Another tragic disaster struck in September, with a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in New Zealand's second biggest city, Christchurch, and the wider Canterbury region. No loss of life occurred, but considerable chaos and destruction resulted (another earthquake in February 2011 killed 181 people). Again, Key's calm and measured handling of the disaster was said to be purely prime ministerial. Christchurch Member of Parliament and cabinet minister, Gerry Brownlee, also received praise for his handling of the Government's response to the Canterbury earthquake. The Government passed a significant piece of legislation to deal with the rebuilding of the city: the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act. Although the parliament voted unanimously in favour of the law, there were many critical voices – especially law academics – who complained that the emergency legislation granted the Executive too much power. Essentially the new law gave the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery, Gerry Brownlee, the power to suspend or repeal around 2,000 laws if they proved inconvenient.</p>
         
         <p>In terms of foreign relations, the highlight of the year for the Government was the visit in November of United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The two governments signed the ‘Wellington Declaration’, which recognised the bilateral cooperation that had developed in recent years. In May, Prime Minister John Key also visited New Zealand troops serving in Afghanistan. And in August, New Zealand suffered its first fatality in the war in Afghanistan.</p>
         
         <p>The National Government remained incredibly popular throughout 2010. Opinion polls suggested that the National Party had the support of at least 50 per cent of voters throughout the year, despite – or perhaps, because of – having to deal with a number of serious challenges. The Government, and Prime Minister John Key, proved remarkably adept at staying within the parameters of the public mood. So even though it sometimes pushed the boundaries in policy changes, it mostly was about tinkering and retaining the status quo. In general, the Government continued to be very incrementalist in nature – pushing reform in a rightward direction, but only very slowly, and only in a very pragmatic fashion. The Government ministers most in line with this approach were also the most influential and, apart from John Key, the strongest performing ministers appeared to be Steven Joyce, Bill English, Simon Power and Tony Ryall. The Cabinet was also joined by Hekia Parata, a female Maori list MP (after the November resignation of the Minister of Women's Affairs, Pansy Wong).</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Other parties in parliament</h2>
         
         <p>The main opposition party, Labour, continued to struggle against a popular government. Leader Phil Goff, although relatively competent, failed to compete with the Prime Minister, and the party ended the year with opinion poll popularity of about 33 per cent, which was the same as when the year began. The party appeared to shift leftwards, with a more hands‐on approach to economic policy, and it also increasingly picked up on concern about traditional left‐wing issues such as economic inequality, unemployment and the rising cost of living. Labour constantly pushed its new slogan ‘For the Many not the Few’, and accused the Government of favouring the wealthy. The status of up‐and‐coming MPs such as Grant Robertson, David Cunliffe and David Parker continued to improve, leading to continued speculation about their future leadership potential.</p>
         
         <p>Labour had to fight a by‐election in November, when the MP for the safe seat of Mana, Winnie Laban, resigned to take another job. Although the party retained the seat, its 6,155 majority was slashed to 1,406 due to a strong showing by National's candidate Hekia Parata. The 6.6 per cent swing to the governing party was widely viewed as an indication of Labour's poor political health.</p>
         
         <p>The Greens had another year of transition – with the resignation from parliament of founding co‐leader, Jeanette Fitzsimons. She was replaced by the next Green candidate on the party list, Gareth Hughes. Later in the year, MP Sue Kedgley announced that she would not be standing for re‐election in the 2011 general election, drawing attention to the almost total replacement of the original Green caucus elected in 1999.</p>
         
         <p>The fourth biggest party in parliament, ACT, had a disastrous year, mainly due to internal factional warfare – mostly between leader Rodney Hide and deputy leader Heather Roy. The two MPs represented two basic factions of the right‐wing party: Hide and supporters favoured a more pragmatic and often populist approach; Roy and supporters were keen to stick to original principles and a focus on policy. The collision was particularly vituperative, and the party came close to a full meltdown. Roy was sacked as deputy and removed from her ministerial role in the Government, after which a dossier was leaked from the Roy camp, which made damaging allegations about leader Rodney Hide's behaviour. Hide was marred by the infighting, but had already been extremely damaged from, first, an MP expenses scandal, and then from his involvement in the scandal involving his colleague David Garrett who resigned when his past criminal convictions were uncovered. The ACT Party and its leader Rodney Hide therefore finished the year looking very weak and unpopular.</p>
         
         <p>The Maori Party also faced internal difficulties – particularly over its proposed legislation to replace the Foreshore and Seabed Act. The existing legislation had been passed by the previous Labour Government, and caused considerable anguish amongst Maori, leading to the creation of the Maori Party. As part of its support agreement with the National Government, the Maori Party put forward the Marine and Coastal Area (<i>Takutai Moana</i>) Bill to replace the Foreshore and Seabed Act. Much of Maoridom opposed the proposed legislation because it was deemed to be too unfavourable towards Maori interests in coastal resources. One of the party's own MPs, Hone Harawira, was particularly vocal in his opposition to his party's own legislation. Harawira was increasingly a controversial figure in public and a source of tension within the party. The party did have some other ‘policy wins’– especially with its persuasion of the Government to finally affirm the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and its creation of a devolved Maori‐focused welfare service delivery model entitled ‘Whānau Ora’.
