         <p>The year 2013 was an eventful one in Austrian politics. It began with a referendum on defence policy in January, followed by two popular initiatives and four regional elections in the spring. The year's high point was the national parliamentary election in autumn, and it ended with the formation of a new cabinet in December.</p>

         <p><i>Land</i> elections in Lower Austria and Carinthia took place on 3 March. Lower Austria – the largest of the nine Austrian <i>Länder</i> – is a People's Party stronghold. In 2008, long‐time <i>Land</i> governor Erwin Pröll and his party won 54 per cent of the votes, 31 of 56 seats in the <i>Land</i> diet and a majority in the <i>Land</i> government. The <i>Land</i> government is proportionally elected by the diet. Apart from the People's Party (ÖVP), the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) (15), the Freedom Party (FPÖ) (6) and the Greens (GA) (4) were represented in the old diet. The continuation of ÖVP single party rule in Lower Austria was threatened by the national party's weak performance and by the new party Team Stronach (FRANK). Nine lists ran in the election. The ÖVP election campaign was built around its popular <i>Land</i> governor Pröll, who collected 267,842 preference votes. The next‐ranked candidates in terms of preference votes, Josef Leitner from the Social Democratic Party (39,706 preference votes) and eccentric Austro‐Canadian billionaire and party leader Frank Stronach (29,728) trailed far behind. The latter's campaign, however, was quite successful in presenting him as the main challenger to ÖVP hegemony. Team Stronach won 9.8 per cent of the votes, five seats in the Land diet and a seat in the <i>Land</i> government. However, the real winner was the ÖVP. Despite losses, it preserved a majority. It collected 50.8 per cent of the votes (–3.6 per cent) and 30 (–1) seats. The Social Democratic Party dropped to 21.6 per cent (–3.9 per cent) and 13 seats (–2), the Freedom Party to 8.2 per cent (–2.3 per cent) and four seats (–2). The Greens' vote share increased to 8.1 per cent (+1.2 per cent). They remained at four seats. Turnout was 70.9 per cent (–3.6 per cent). The new <i>Land</i> government is composed of six members from the ÖVP, two from SPÖ and one from Team Stronach. Pröll was elected <i>Land</i> governor for the sixth time in a row since 1992.
         </p>
         
         <p>Large‐scale political change loomed in Carinthia where early elections provided voters with an opportunity to settle scores with the party of former <i>Land</i> governor Jörg Haider (see Jenny <span><a href="#epdy12038-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12038-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 25–27). In 2009 his party, labelling itself the ‘Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) – The Freedomites in Carinthia’ ran a very successful election campaign of political hagiolatry of Haider who had died half a year before, and won almost 45 per cent of the votes and the <i>Land</i> governorship. The <i>Land</i> party left the BZÖ national party organisation shortly after that election, named itself ‘The Freedomites in Carinthia (FPK)’ and concluded an agreement of loose cooperation with the Freedom Party a few months later.
         </p>
         
         <p>The FPK held 17 out of 36 seats in the diet. The SPÖ had 11, ÖVP six and the Greens two. A coalition of FPK and ÖVP had the majority in the <i>Land</i> government, which is proportionally elected by the diet. The spectacular run‐down of the former <i>Land</i> bank Hypo Alpe Adria in the Haider era and several other scandals implicated the FPK's current leadership group. The regional People's Party was hurting, too, from participation in the coalition and its ex‐leader's involvement in a party finance scandal. State secretary Wolfgang Waldner was sent from Vienna to run as candidate for the <i>Land</i> governorship. The SPÖ, led by Peter Kaiser, wanted to regain the position as largest party that it had held in the pre‐Haider era. The Greens, presiding over a committee of inquiry on the Hypo Alpe Adria affair, expected vote gains, too.
         </p>
         
         <p>Ten lists ran in the election, including BZÖ and Team Stronach. The voters' verdict was harsh. The FPK dropped from 44.9 to 16.9 per cent of the votes (–28.0 per cent) and was reduced to six seats (–11). The ÖVP got 14.4 per cent (–2.4 per cent) and five seats (–1). The Social Democratic Party increased its vote share to 37.1 per cent (+8.4 per cent) and 14 (+3) seats, the Greens to 12.1 per cent (+5.2 per cent) and five seats (+3). Team Stronach received 11.2 per cent and four seats, BZÖ 6.4 per cent and two seats. A single postal vote decided a seat in favour of the Greens and against the BZÖ. Turnout was 75.2 per cent (–6.6 per cent). The FPK lost one of its two seats in the federal chamber to the SPÖ. The new <i>Land</i> government is made up of three members from the SPÖ and one member each from ÖVP, Greens, FPK and Team Stronach. SPÖ, ÖVP and the Greens concluded a coalition agreement and elected SPÖ party leader Kaiser as <i>Land</i> governor. The national Freedom Party exerted pressure on prominent FPK MPs to resign from the diet and successfully managed a reunion of FPÖ and FPK before the national election.
         </p>
         
         <p>The regional election in Salzburg on 5 May was also an early election. A speculation scandal in the <i>Land</i> government's finance department brought a premature end to the coalition between SPÖ, which held the portfolio, and the ÖVP. Polls predicted a close race between Social Democratic <i>Land</i> governor Gabrielle Burgstaller and her ÖVP rival, deputy <i>Land</i> governor Wilfried Haslauer. The Social Democrats had been ahead by a single seat in the last election and both party leaders issued resignation threats if the party did not win first place. In addition to the parliamentary opposition – the Freedom Party with five seats and the Greens with two – three lists, including Team Stronach, ran in the election. The Greens' party leader, Astrid Rössler, had chaired the diet's committee of inquiry into the scandal and polls predicted gains for her party, for the FPÖ, as well as entry to the diet for Team Stronach. The polls underestimated the voters' reactions, however.
         </p>
         
         <p>The SPÖ vote share dropped from 39.4 to 23.8 per cent, giving it only nine seats (–6). Burgstaller immediately stepped down from office. The vote share of the People's Party decreased from 36.5 to 29.0 per cent, which translated into 11 seats (–3) and first place. The Greens jumped from 7.4 to 20.2 per cent of the votes and seven seats (+5). The Freedom Party's share increased from 13.0 to 17.0 per cent and six seats (+1). Team Stronach got 8.3 per cent and three seats. Turnout was 71.0 per cent (–3.4 per cent). The People's Party, the Greens and Team Stronach formed a three‐party coalition government, and ÖVP party leader Haslauer was elected <i>Land</i> governor. The <i>Land</i> election result also provided the Greens and the Freedom Party with a seat each in the national parliament's federal chamber, which had been lost by SPÖ and ÖVP.
         </p>
         
         <p>The last <i>Land</i> elections took place in Tyrol on 28 April. Tyrol had traditionally been a stronghold of the People's Party, but a party split‐off deprived it of its majority in the election in 2008. <i>Land</i> governor Günther Platter, a previous federal minister, took the reins of the ÖVP after its dismal result and headed a coalition government with the SPÖ. The ÖVP had 16 out of 36 seats in the diet. SPÖ and List Fritz Dinkhauser had five seats each. The latter initially had seven seats, but two members left and formed a separate grouping (‘BürgerKlub Tirol’). FPÖ and Greens had four seats each. The campaign issues fought over were small compared to the issues of the Carinthian or Salzburg elections. The ÖVP hoped to re‐attract voters from List Fritz Dinkhauser, which suffered not only from quarrelling but also lost its populist leader due to health reasons. Yet in 2013 the ÖVP confronted even more competition from ex‐party cadres. A new important rival list was ‘vorwärts Tirol’, led by the mayor of the <i>Land</i> capital and a former <i>Land</i> government member. It also included an ex‐<i>Land</i> government member from the SPÖ. After a string of successes, Team Stronach stumbled in the run‐up to the Tyrolian election. Three rival groups submitted candidate lists to the electoral authority, each claiming to represent the party. The electoral authority accepted the first list sent in, which was not the one with the party founder's backing. These two groups managed a reunion. The remaining one engaged in ‘negative’ campaigning and advised against voting for Team Stronach.
         </p>
         
         <p>Eleven lists competed in the <i>Land</i> election. The ÖVP obtained 39.4 per cent (–1.2 per cent), and preserved its 16 seats. List Fritz Dinkhauser dropped to 5.6 per cent (–12.7 per cent) and two seats (–5). The Social Democratic Party achieved 13.7 per cent (–1.7 per cent) and again five seats. The Freedom Party dropped to 9.3 per cent (–3.1 per cent) but remained at four seats. The Greens had a slight increase to 12.6 per cent (+1.9) and five seats (+1). Bürgerklub Tirol (4.8 per cent) and Team Stronach (3.4 per cent) failed to enter the diet. Turnout was low at only 60.4 per cent (–5.4 per cent). ÖVP and SPÖ decided to continue the coalition, and Platter was again elected as <i>Land</i> governor. The Greens took over a federal chamber seat previously occupied by List Fritz Dinkhauser.
         </p>
         
         <p>The national parliamentary elections took place on 29 September. The previous election in 2008 brought losses for the largest parliamentary parties, SPÖ and ÖVP, which ruled in a ‘grand coalition’ government. Polls again predicted losses. In spring, the oppositional Freedom Party was ahead of the ÖVP in some polls and the combined vote share of the two government parties was less than 50 per cent. However, when the election campaigns started in July, the People's Party leaped ahead of the FPÖ again.</p>
         
         <p>On many economic indicators Austria had fared better than most EU Member States during the European economic crisis, but of course the crisis had taken a toll. The federal government had to save several banks from collapse and the country lost Standard &amp; Poor's triple‐A rating in 2012. The number of unemployed, while low in comparative terms with an International Labour Organisation rate of 5.1 per cent in 2013, hovered just below an historical postwar maximum. During the last period parliament passed a total of 647 federal laws, but critics bemoaned the lack of structural reforms, citing intra‐coalition blockades and a lack of political will to take on entrenched interest groups. Discontent with the country's political elite was also fuelled by a parliamentary committee of inquiry, which highlighted corruption scandals and malpractices that implicated politicians from almost all parties except for the Greens (see Jenny <span><a href="#epdy12038-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12038-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 25–27).
         </p>
         
         <p>The national elections were held under modified rules. Preferential voting was introduced to all three levels of the electoral system and the existing thresholds were lowered. Regional electoral districts were reduced from 43 to 39 due to administrative district mergers in Styria. The <i>Land</i> government's plan to merge small municipalities into larger ones stirred election boycott calls by local party chapters of SPÖ and ÖVP, which also ruled in Styria. New campaigning restrictions set expenditures ceilings for parties at €7 million for a party and €15,000 for candidates during the campaign period starting about 80 days before the election. Team Stronach, backed by its wealthy party leader, declared that it was going to disregard the limit and pay the fine for over‐spending. The market research company Focus Media Research put total party expenditures for campaign advertising in the national election at €32.5 million, of which almost a third (€10.7 million) was attributed to Team Stronach. SPÖ expenditures were estimated at €7.1 million. With price discounts factored in, the sum spent was within the limit, the party claimed. The estimates for the ÖVP expenditures were €5 million, FPÖ €3.5 million, Greens €2.9 million, BZÖ €2.1 million and NEOS €942,000.
         </p>
         
         <p>Both government parties laid out familiar and opposing policy positions in their election programmes. The SPÖ called for a wealth tax and general introduction of comprehensive schools, which were both strongly opposed by the ÖVP. The SPÖ categorically ruled out a coalition with the FPÖ, while the ÖVP did not commit itself during the campaign. The Freedom Party called on the SPÖ to end its ostracism, which was only benefiting the People's Party. The FPÖ set a target of 20 per cent of votes. It faced a new rival in Team Stronach, as both parties were populist and Eurosceptic, though Team Stronach was more liberal on immigration. In 2013, the Freedom Party softened its rhetoric without giving up its nativist policy positions. Loaded terms (‘foreigners’) were replaced by less offensive sounding ones (‘<i>Inländerfreundlich</i>’). A central issue of the Greens' campaign was the fight against corruption, on which they had built a track record as leaders of parliamentary committees of inquiry at the national and regional level. The Greens declared their interest in joining a government coalition. Campaign appearances by Stronach harmed his own party's claim to seriousness, such as when he advocated the death penalty for professional hitmen. A recruitment coup by his party in the midst of the campaign disintegrated within days. A former general director of the Austrian public broadcasting corporation ORF, Monika Lindner, had agreed to run as number three on the national list. Without her consent, the party shortly afterwards declared her a ‘spearhead’ against ORF and ÖVP – the institutions that had supported her career. Lindner resigned, but the list was by then already fixed. After the election a media storm broke when she changed her mind and took the seat as an independent MP.
         </p>
         
         <p>Televised debates were important and frequent campaign events (18 pairwise and roundtable confrontations between party leaders took place). Debates on state television were restricted to parliamentary parties and thus excluded NEOS (‘The New Austria’) – a new party founded by a group of liberal‐minded, urban, middle‐class citizens. Several of them had previously been active in the ÖVP, among them party leader Matthias Strolz, a management consultant with an esoteric streak. The party agreed with the older liberal party Liberal Forum to run a joint list. The cooperation secured financial support from building tycoon Hans Peter Haselsteiner, a former liberal MP, who figured as a ministerial candidate for NEOS in the final weeks of the campaign. NEOS's stated goal was to end the coalition's parliamentary majority and to participate in the next government. Polls taken during the campaign put the party constantly below the 4 per cent entry threshold before a strong upswing came in the final days of the campaign.</p>
         
         <p>The election's outcome brought losses for the government parties. The SPÖ obtained 26.8 per cent (–2.4 per cent) of votes, the ÖVP 24.0 (–2.0), the Freedom Party 20.5 (+3.0) and the Greens 12.4 (+2.0). The new parties Team Stronach and NEOS gained 5.7 and 5.0 per cent, respectively. The BZÖ dropped from 10.7 to 3.5 per cent and out of parliament. The new seat distribution is 52 (–5) for the SPÖ, 47 (–4) for ÖVP, 40 (+6) for FPÖ, 24 (+4) for the Greens, 11 for Team Stronach and nine for NEOS. Turnout in the election was 74.9 per cent (–3.9 per cent).</p>
         
         <p>NEOS was euphoric about the outcome. The other opposition parties' level of frustration varied as, despite gains obtained, the SPÖ‐ÖVP majority had not fallen. The Greens won less than expected because of NEOS, the FPÖ because of Team Stronach and the latter's leader was deeply disappointed with his party's single digit result. He had financed the election campaign through ‘credits’ to the national party headquarters amounting to €13.6 million, which was distributed to regional party organisations. After the election, Stronach asked the <i>Land</i> party organisations to pay the money back.
         </p>
         
         <p>The rank order of the ‘traditional’ parties remained intact, but relative differences shrank again. The combined vote share of the government parties fell from 55.2 per cent (108 seats in 2008) to 50.8 per cent (99). Parliament now consists of three mid‐sized and three small parties, and the effective number of parties, based on vote shares, stands at the new maximum of 5.2 (4.8 in 2008). The net index of volatility for 2008–2013 was 16.8, the third‐largest value after 16.9 for 2006–2008 and the maximum value of 21.0 for 1999–2002.</p>

            <p>A consultative referendum on 20 January was on abolishing conscription, which had been an SPÖ campaign pledge in the Vienna <i>Land</i> election of 2010 (Jenny <span><a href="#epdy12038-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12038-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 27). The coalition was at loggerheads on the issue and finally resorted to asking the electorate, whose majority opinion would be accepted as binding. Voters had a choice between introducing a new system with a professional army plus voluntary community service open to both sexes, or keeping the current system of general conscription and alternative civilian service for males. The second option was the ÖVP position, which was also supported by the FPÖ and to the dismay of the SPÖ, also by Federal President Heinz Fischer. The Greens supported abolition. Team Stronach remained neutral and the BZÖ urged voters not to participate. A clear majority of 59.7 per cent of valid votes opted for keeping the current system. Turnout was 52.4 per cent. Post‐referendum polls suggest that the ÖVP strategy of widening the issue to include social policy and disaster relief succeeded. Young voters of both sexes favoured a professional army. Middle aged and elderly voters – the primary clients of the alternative civilian service – preferred the status quo.

            <p>Two popular initiatives failed in mid‐April to collect the 100,000 signatures required for consideration by parliament. The initiative ‘Democracy Now’ collected 69,841 signatures (1.10 per cent). It had been introduced by the group ‘My Austria’, which described itself as a citizens' movement agitating against ‘reform blockade’ in Austrian politics. It included a number of prominent former politicians, variously depicted as elder statesmen or, as one of them noted self‐deprecatingly, the pair of old hecklers in the television series <i>The Muppet Show</i>. ‘Democracy Now’ advocated radical institutional reform, including a mixed‐member electoral system for the national parliament's first chamber and abolition of the second chamber, stronger direct democratic procedures and reduced legislative powers for the <i>Länder</i>. The second initiative, ‘Against Church Privileges’, called for a strict separation of state and (Catholic) church, an end to public subsidies and for inquests into past abuse in church‐run institutions. It was signed by 56,660 citizens (0.89 per cent of the electorate). The two initiatives rank at the bottom of the 37 popular initiatives introduced so far.

         <p>Social Democratic Defence Minister Norbert Darabos stepped down on 11 March and was replaced by Gerhard Klug, an MP in the parliament's federal chamber. He had turned into a political liability after the lost referendum and returned to party headquarters to manage the upcoming election campaign.</p>
         
         <p>The government resigned after the election. SPÖ leader Faymann held a sounding out talk with FPÖ leader Strache to silence a few intra‐party critics. The stated goal was to continue the coalition with the ÖVP. The ÖVP held bilateral talks with all parliamentary parties before it agreed to negotiations. President Fischer tasked Faymann as leader of the largest party with forming a new stable coalition government. He also expressed a wish for continuity. The coalition negotiations lasted two months. Fixing medium‐term budget projections became a major sticking point. Experts had revised pre‐election budget outlooks downwards which reduced the leeway for the implementation of costly campaign pledges. The parties in the end agreed on a 114‐page work plan for the government (‘Arbeitsprogramm der österreichischen Bundsregierung 2013–2018. Erfolgreich. Österreich’). They promised a ‘new style of governing’ – as they had done in 2008 – and set a ‘structural zero budget deficit’ as a target to be reached in 2016. The coalition treaty included a short‐term increase in family allowances and promised to relieve income taxpayers from inflation‐caused fiscal drag that ate up payment rises as soon as allowed for by the budgetary situation. Unsurprisingly, the coalition treaty was a set of policy compromises that received lukewarm reception in both parties. The leader of the small SPÖ <i>Land</i> party organisation of Vorarlberg voted against the coalition treaty. The Styrian <i>Land</i> governor absented himself from the vote and resigned as a deputy to the national party leader. His Styrian colleague from the People's Party likewise left his own party's session before the vote on the coalition treaty.
         </p>
         
         <p>The cabinet consisted of 14 ministers, seven from each party as before, but the number of state secretaries went from two to one for each party. The SPÖ team continued almost unchanged. The Minister of Education, Claudia Schmied, resigned and was replaced by the previous Minister for Women and Public Service, Heinisch‐Hosek. The ÖVP exchanged half of its team. Vice‐Chancellor Spindelegger had been Foreign Minister in the previous cabinet and now took the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry for Foreign and International Affairs was handed to former state secretary Sebastian Kurz. At 27, he became the country's youngest minister. The Minister for Agriculture and Environment and the Minister for Justice were also replaced.</p>
         
         <p>Critically received in the reshuffling of ministerial responsibilities was the abolition of the cabinet post for Science and Research. The ÖVP minister who had held it was informed on short notice by his party leader that he was no longer needed. The responsibilities moved to the Minister for the Economy. In exchange, Youth and Family Affairs were split off from the latter and turned into a new cabinet post. The designated minister, Sophie Karmasin, was not a party member and had not held political office before. As owner of a polling firm, she had frequently commented on television during the last election campaign.</p>
         
         <p>The new government was sworn in on 16 December, 74 days after the election. Changes in ministerial responsibilities went into effect in March 2014. The former Minister for Science and Research Karlheinz Töchterle, now an MP, voted against the ministries bill. Styrian ÖVP MPs left the plenary ahead of the vote. The new and old federal chancellor Werner Faymann and vice‐chancellor Michael Spindelegger indicated that they would continue a gradualist approach towards policy reform. Faymann stated that ‘there is no need to reinvent Austria’. As the traditional synonym for the coalition between SPÖ and ÖVP – ‘grand coalition’ – no longer fits, the new label ‘mid‐sized coalition’ (‘<i>mittelgroße Koalition</i>’) was coined. The new government had a less than optimal start. Polls at year's end ranked the Freedom Party in first place and estimated a combined vote share of the coalition parties below 50 per cent.

         <p>Against a background of high party cohesion in parliament, Austrian media usually praise the virtues of the free mandate in the rare instances when a single or a few MPs vote against the party line. In the case of renegade Team Stronach MP, Monika Lindner, commentators uniformly agreed that a lone MP can do almost nothing in an assembly populated by disciplined parliamentary parties and that she had to give the seat back to her party. After serving only 29 days as MP, Lindner caved in to the intense public pressure and resigned. Party leader Stronach ended his career in parliament after only three months.</p>
         
         <p>News reports drawing on Edward Snowden's leak of United States National Security Agency (NSA) files suggest that an Austrian military intelligence agency cooperated with the NSA and that there was even a memorandum of agreement between them. To the fury of opposition parties FPÖ and Greens, Defence Minister Klug refrained from answering any questions in the standing sub‐committee specifically tasked to control the military intelligence agencies.</p>
