         <p>In his annual New Year's speech, Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen dealt with the extremely tense situation that had emerged in relation to the Muslim world as a result of the publication of 12 cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in <i>Jyllands‐Posten</i>, a Danish daily newspaper, on 30 September 2005. The Prime Minister denounced any statement, action or any kind of expression aimed at demonising groups of people on the grounds of their religion or ethnicity. At the same time, he emphasised that there is a healthy tradition in Denmark of asking critical questions of all those in authority, whether political or religious, and it is this relaxed relationship to authority, including the use of humour and satire, that has contributed to progress in Danish society. Freedom of speech is therefore so important that compromises cannot be made. This was beyond discussion and not subject to negotiation. However, everyone is responsible for exercising their freedom of speech in a manner that does not incite hatred or splinter the community that has been one of Denmark's strengths.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 4 January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received an official protest about the cartoons from the League of Arab States, following a resolution passed on 29 December 2005 that urged the Danish government to take action. Delegations of Muslims residing in Denmark travelled to Egypt, Syria and Lebanon in order to create international pressure on the Danish government to issue an apology for the publication of the cartoons. On 26 January, Saudi Arabia called its ambassador home for consultation, while at the same time Saudi religious and political leaders encouraged the boycott of Danish goods – a call that was met and quickly and efficiently spread to other Muslim countries. On 29 January, demonstrators burned the Danish flag in Nablus on the West Bank. A very pressed Danish Prime Minister reiterated the government's principled position in the case, but he added that because of his respect for the religious convictions of others, he would never portray Mohammed, Jesus or any other religious figures in a manner that could be found offensive. <i>Jyllands‐Posten</i> issued a statement via all of the news agencies in the Middle East in which the newspaper apologised for violating the sentiments of Muslims.
         </p>
         
         <p>At a meeting of Foreign Ministers in Brussels on January 30, Denmark received the support of the European Union (EU) countries should the conflict with the Muslim world over the cartoons develop into an official trade boycott of Danish goods, and the Foreign Ministers condemned the threats and attacks on Nordic citizens. The Danish government intensified its diplomatic offensive, while at the same time more flags and images of the Danish Prime Minister were burned amid demands for a clear and unequivocal official apology from the Danish government.</p>
         
         <p>Almost 150 newspapers from throughout Europe published all or some of the <i>Jyllands‐Posten</i> cartoons, claiming to be defending freedom of speech. This further exacerbated the conflict inside and outside of Europe. The situation was so serious that the government took two unusual steps. First, Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen gave an interview on 2 February on <i>Al‐Arabiya</i>, the Arab news channel; and second, the government invited all of the diplomatic representations in Copenhagen to a meeting on 3 February in order to brief them on the opinion and position of the government. On 4 February, demonstrators burned down the Danish Embassy in Damascus, the Syrian capital; the next day, the Danish consulate in the Lebanese capital of Beirut was also burned down after violent unrest; and the day after that, it was the turn of the Danish Embassy in Iran. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Per Stig Møller, Denmark stood in the midst of its worst foreign policy crisis since 1945. The Danish public was simply shocked.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the following week, there were signs that the crisis had passed its peak. As newspapers in many other countries had also published the cartoons, the focus was no longer only on Denmark. The diplomatic measures taken by the EU also appeared to have had an effect. The same can be said about the written declaration signed by 41 of the world's most influential Muslim scholars and muftis, issued on 13 February, in which they condemned the recent violent protests and the burning of embassies. Friday prayers were not used to escalate the crisis. In the course of the months that followed, the outcry gradually abated. The Danish public was deeply shaken and found themselves with a radically different international image in large parts of the world – hardly something to which the people of Denmark were accustomed. The goodwill that Danes normally meet when abroad could no longer be taken for granted in all countries. Danish travellers removed the Danish flag from their backpacks. The cartoon crisis and the presence of Danish military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan meant that Denmark was no longer just a cute little country playing by itself in the corner. Denmark had been thrust directly into the centre of one of the great global dimensions of conflict.</p>
         
         <p>The crisis led to a polarisation of domestic politics. The immediate reaction of the electorate was in the form of increased support to the Danish People's Party, the Socialist People's Party and the Social Liberals. The Danish People's Party insisted on a thorough investigation of the role played by the imams in Denmark and the Egyptian government. This received the support of the opposition, which also called for an independent investigation into the government's handing of the affair. However, the Danish People's Party saw no reason for such a probe. This proposal thus proceeded no further, and the opposition instead had to content itself with posing critical questions to ministers in Parliament. On the legal level, the crisis was resolved on 15 March by the Danish Director of Public Prosecutions (<i>Rigsadvokaten</i>), who ruled that the caricatures of Mohammed did not violate either the blasphemy or the racism sections of the Danish Criminal Code. The crisis also led many Danish Muslims to declare that they neither agreed with, nor felt themselves represented by, the perspectives that a number of Danish imams had stood for and worked to realise – supposedly on behalf of the Muslim community.
         </p>
         
         <p>On other matters, the Social Democrats accepted in January the government's so‐called ‘tax‐stop’– an ongoing attempt to halt what some see as an almost institutionalised growth in taxation. However, they also insisted they would introduce a stop on increasing user fees for public transport, childcare institutions and continuing education. The party would work for tax reform, with lower taxes on work, an unchanged tax rate and a simplification of the taxation system. The reform was intended to be based upon broad political consensus, which effectively afforded the right‐of‐centre parties a veto. The Social Democratic leadership believed that the state, due to the huge budget surplus, did not lack money. Instead of the tax reliefs the government would try to introduce immediately prior to the next election, it should make massive investments in the public sector in order to increase the quality of welfare. The difference between the Social Democrats and the government was therefore drawn more sharply: increased welfare or taxation relief, public sector or private sector.</p>
         
         <p>The increased distance between the Social Democrats and the Social Liberals in relation to important political issues – distance that had previously developed gradually – now became clearer as the Social Liberals were strongly opposed to a tax stop. In April, the Social Liberals issued their so‐called ‘Freedom Letter’: the party would no longer automatically maintain its alliance with the Social Democrats. Generally speaking, the Social Liberal votes in Parliament could no longer be counted on by the groups to the left or the right. Despite this disagreement, in June, the government, the Social Democrats, the Danish People's Party and the Social Liberals engaged in a comprehensive settlement concerning welfare reform. The question that created the greatest conflict had been about whether the early retirement allowance scheme ought to be abolished. It was retained as a right that could still be received for five years. The age for early retirement was gradually increased from 60 to 62 years, and eligibility for state retirement pension was increased from 65 to 67 years of age as of 2022, though there was a clause that the age for early retirement and ordinary retirement ought to increase in line with the average age of the population. If the standard life expectancy continued to increase at the same rate as had previously been the case, this could mean that the age for retirement and early retirement in 2025 could be 68 years and 63 years, respectively.</p>
         
         <p>There was also agreement about investing 10 billion DKK (US$1.8 billion) in research, the strengthening of education programmes and continued education, and a fund of 3 billion DKK (US$0.55 billion) was established for the prevention of physical and psychological fatigue, just as the monitoring of work environments was strengthened. The later retirement age, together with the other initiatives for the promotion of employment included in the settlement, convinced the parties behind the settlement that by increasing labour market participation and economic dynamism, they had built a solid foundation for the maintenance of the welfare society for decades to come. One must always be cautious when describing events as ‘historic’, but this settlement definitely belongs in this category. The settlement was entirely unusual in terms of the fact that it encompassed social, education, research, labour market, integration and immigration policies, as well as the fact that it was to be in effect for an unusually long period of time and had a very broad parliamentary majority behind it. This testified to a mature and well‐functioning party system, which despite the constant struggle between parties over votes, could transcend short‐sighted interests.</p>
         
         <p>The year ended with a minor crisis between the government and its support party. The leading Conservative politicians had repeatedly made critical statements about the dependence of the government on the Danish People's Party because they found that it damaged the reputation of Denmark abroad. When the opposition to the left of the government presented a vote of no confidence in the Conservative Minister for Family and Consumer Affairs in April over failure to police food standards, the Danish People's Party refrained from voting for the proposal after being pressured by the Prime Minister. Yet when an independent investigation later in the year again revealed failures by agencies under the Ministry for Family and Consumer Affairs, the patience of the Danish People's Party was spent. It now had opportunity to retaliate against the criticism earlier delivered by the Conservatives by demanding the Minister's exit, and this time the Prime Minister gave in – to the great dismay of the Conservatives.</p>
         
         <p>The year 2006, then, included a number of very important events. Fundamental principles in a democratic society had been subject to comprehensive public debate. Denmark had experienced what it was like to suddenly find itself in international crossfire, with undesirable consequences. The most important of these for domestic politics was a polarisation of a central policy area and soul‐searching in the Muslim community. Ditches were dug and fences built, but the cohesion between the political parties remained robust enough for a large historical settlement on welfare policy to be passed by a broad majority in the Parliament. The pattern of cooperation remained fundamentally unchanged, but the small movements that could be traced after the 2005 election were further reinforced. Most importantly, the Social Liberals gave up committing themselves in advance to a Social Democrat‐led government. Nor was it without significance that the Conservatives and the Danish People's Party were increasingly on a collision course: many Conservatives would like to look towards the Social Liberals. The year also included internal dissent within Venstre – both as regards the top‐down steering of the party and the ties to the Danish People's Party. By and large, the Social Democrats managed to pull themselves together, and after a violent drop in the opinion polls in the beginning of the year, they were again on their way forward with a newly formulated welfare policy.</p>
