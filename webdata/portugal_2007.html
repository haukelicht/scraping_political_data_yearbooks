         <p>Throughout 2008 the Portuguese government continued on the path of reform, which was constrained by the stability and convergence programme agreed with the European Union. At the forefront was the reform of public administration through its two main programmes: the programme for the restructuring of the central administration of the state (PRACE) and the programme for the simplification of administrative procedures (SIMPLEX). The government expanded its network of citizens’ shops across the country to bring public administration closer to the citizen.</p>
         
         <p>In health and education, several problems emerged as the government attempted to implement its austerity and modernisation programmes. The crisis in the health sector (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Oliveira et al. 2005</a></span>) was reinforced by growing protests both by the general public and by the medical and nursing professions. Many measures led to major cuts in night‐time emergency services in the smaller urban centres. The government had to revise its modernisation programme for the education sector, which envisaged a change from the seniority principle to performance‐related pay. Two demonstrations in March and November comprising 80,000 and 120,000 teachers, respectively, put the government under pressure. Furthermore, a general strike on 3 December 2008, in which teachers were particularly involved, led finally to further negotiations between government and the trade union confederations. It was agreed that the new model would not be introduced until 2013 in order to avoid inequalities between different groups (Naumann &amp; Lima 2009).
         </p>
         
         <p>The government also negotiated a new labour law code with the social partners. The main intention was to make labour dismissal procedures more flexible and to introduce more flexible forms of work. Provisions to achieve better work‐life balance in enterprises were also included. Probationary periods for new employees were raised from 3 to 6 months. The new labour code was supported by the main employers’ organisations and the second largest trade union confederation, the socialist‐social democratic General Union of Workers (UGT). The largest union, the Communist General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP‐In), vehemently opposed the new labour code and staged several protests across the country during the year. In the end, the new labour code was approved by Parliament on 7 November 2008 with only the votes of the Socialist parliamentary group. The right‐of‐centre parties abstained, while the Communists and the Bloc of the Left voted against. The labour law was sent to the Constitutional Court, which required the introduction of more stipulations regarding probationary periods. As a result, the labour law did not come into force on 1 January 2009 as intended (Naumann &amp; Lima 2009).</p>
         
         <p>In the second half of the year, the Socrates Government had to deal with the impact of the global financial crisis on Portugal. As in other countries, some Portuguese banks were in dire straits and had to apply for public funds in order to continue in business. Among these institutions were two private investment banks: the Millennium‐Banco Comercial Português (Millenium‐BCP) and the Banco de Negócios Português (BNP). The BNP was nationalised by the government in November 2008. It was discovered that the bank had losses of €700 million, and was engaged in dubious business dealings (Naumann &amp; Lima 2009). The main opposition party demanded a committee of inquiry into the alleged supervisory failure by the Bank of Portugal. The government introduced several measures, including the increase of security deposit amounts for banks and individual accounts, in order to tighten the regulation of Portuguese finance markets.</p>
         
         <p>During December, in the light of the strategy on the financial crisis adopted at the European level, the government presented a recovery programme comprising 29 measures and costing €2.18 billion, which included also EU structural funds. The programme also included the acceleration of existing infrastructure projects so that further demand could be injected, Keynesian‐style, into labour market. The overall stimulus package comprised 0.8 per cent of GDP. Finance Minister Teixeira dos Santos predicted an increase in the budget deficit from 2.2 per cent to over 3 per cent, so that the Stability and Growth programme had to be revised until 2011. Overall, the Portuguese economy continued with major difficulties throughout the year, worsened by the finance crisis. GDP growth stagnated throughout 2008, and it is expected to contract 0.8 per cent in 2009 (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Torres 2009</a></span>; <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">European Commission 2009</a></span>).

         <p>On 30 January 2008, Prime Minister José Socrates reshuffled his cabinet. The main reason was that there was growing criticism of the health reform policy implemented by Minister António Correia de Campos, which involved substantial cuts in important services like emergency wards. The public staged several protests throughout 2007 and 2008 against both the cuts and Minister Correia de Campos, leading to the latter's replacement by Ana Jorge, a pediatrician at the D. Estefania hospital in Lisbon. Her appointment led to mixed reactions because of her support for Manuel Alegre, who, as a candidate in the presidential elections of 2006, ran against the official candidate of the Socialist Party, Mário Soares.</p>
         
         <p>In the same reshuffle, Prime Minister Socrates replaced Minister of Culture Maria Isabel Pires de Lima (who resigned because of growing criticisms of the substantial cuts in the sector) with José Antonio Pinto Ribeiro, who was close to the Socialist Party and director of the Contemporary Art Foundation Berardo.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Party politics: Negotiation of the bill on public financing of political parties and change of leader by the PSD</h2>
         
         <p>Throughout 2008, the main political parties, PS and PSD, were engaged in negotiating a revised version of the 2003 law on party financing. The new law is supposed to allow for more public funding for presidential elections, particularly in relation to the eventual second round, and the local elections. The negotiations with the smaller parties were not completed at the end of the year, but it was foreseen that the new law had to be ratified before the electoral cycle of 2009, which comprised European, legislative and local elections.</p>
         
         <p>After the resignation of PSD leader Filipe de Menezes on 17 April, new primaries were held in the PSD. Although no official reasons were given, it seems that Filipe de Menezes lacked the necessary support within the party to continue in office. He decided to call for new primaries, which were scheduled for 31 May. In the primaries, there were four candidates, among them former prime minister Pedro Santana Lopes and former finance minister Manuela Ferreira Leite, who was apparently de Menezes' main critic before his resignation. Manuela Ferreira Leite won the elections with 37.9 per cent. Pedro Passos Coelho and Pedro Santana Lopes, two supporters of Filipe de Menezes, came a distant second and third with 31.1 and 29.5 per cent, respectively. In spite of this leadership change, the party was unable to make significant gains in the opinion polls and its internal factionalism continued to weaken it considerably. Moreover, a large number of PSD MPs missed crucial votes in parliament, thus weakening the position of party leader Manuela Ferreira Leite.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Institutional conflict between government and the President of the Republic: The reform of the divorce law and the revision of the Regional Autonomy Statute of the Azores Islands</h2>
         
         <p>The Socrates Government came into conflict with President Anibal Cavaco Silva over several bills that were intended to reform particular laws. Probably the most salient issue was the reform of the divorce law. The Assembly of the Republic approved the new bill with the votes of the Socialists, Communists and the Bloc of the Left, while the right‐of‐centre parties, the Social Democrats (PSD) and Democratic Social Centre (CDS‐PP) voted against it. The law envisaged a modernisation of the present divorce law, which is based on the guilty party principle. The reform wanted to facilitate divorce and no longer use the guilty principle as reason for it. The period for litigation was reduced from three years to one. However, President Cavaco Silva refused to sign it into law and sent it back to the Assembly of the Republic in order to restore some of its original intentions. He was supported by the right‐of‐centre parties and the Catholic Church. On 16 September, the new law was approved with the votes of the left‐wing parties and eleven PSD MPs.</p>
         
         <p>Since 1976, the Portuguese Constitution has granted regional autonomy to the island archipelagos of Azores and Madeira. During 2005 and 2006, the Legislative Assembly of Azores has been working on the third revision of the Political‐Administrative Statute, which was approved on 31 October 2007. The revised document was sent to the Portuguese parliament, which approved it in June 2008. This was sent to President Anibal Cavaco Silva for final ratification. However, he deemed some new provisions unconstitutional and sent it to the Constitutional Court. The Court ruled that eight revised articles were unconstitutional, so the document was sent back to the parliament for revision. After removal of the unconstitutional articles, Parliament voted again, with a two‐thirds majority of votes for the revised statute. However, on 27 October, President Anibal Cavaco Silva vetoed the draft statute because it still contained two articles (114 and 240.2), which he regarded as unconstitutional. Article 114 obliged the President of the Republic to consult first, along with the legal‐advisory council of state and the represented parties in the legislative assembly, the regional government. Article 240.2 limited MPs’ power of legislative initiative in relation to future revisions of the statute.</p>
         
         <p>In spite of this veto, the Assembly of the Republic decided to override the presidential veto and, after consultation among the chairmen of the parliamentary groups, to approve the statute with a simple majority on 19 December 2008. This naturally led to a major institutional conflict between, on one side, the President of the Republic and the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, and, on the other side, the ruling socialist government and party, which had hitherto attempted so‐called ‘strategic cooperation’ with the President. In the end, President Cavaco Silva had no choice but to approve the new statute. However, the possibility of future checks on its constitutionality may remain on the cards for some MPs.</p>
         
         <p>In the December vote, the PSD urged their parliamentary group to abstain from the vote. However, two MPs from Azores voted for the statute. Other MPs were forbidden to vote against. This was due to a major conflict between the new leader of the PSD, Manuela Ferreira Leite (who was for the statute in its present version), and former leader Felipe de Menezes (who had already promised President Cavaco Silva before March 2008 that the PSD would vote against that version). The inconsistent position of the PSD, which voted first for and then abstained, became a major problem for the credibility of the party. Moreover, there was a growing rift between the PSD‐Azores, which sided with all the other parties, and the national PSD, which was split between supporters and opponents of the last version of the statute.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> The regional elections in Azores on 19 October</h2>
         
         <p>This institutional conflict had a spill‐over effect upon the electoral campaign to the regional elections in Azores on 19 October 2008. The socialist regional government under President Carlos César was able to exploit the conflict over the regional statute to discredit the intentions of the PSD, the main opposition party. The PSD was unable to present a consistent discourse over regional autonomy. For Prime Minister Socrates the regional elections were regarded as a test ahead of elections in 2009. He intensively supported the electoral campaign of regional president Carlos César. On election day, the PS was able to secure an absolute majority with 49.92 per cent and 30 votes; however, its electoral support declined by almost 7 per cent and led to the loss of one seat. The main opposition party, PSD, got only 30.27 per cent of the vote and 18 seats, though in the previous elections the party had run a coalition list with the conservative CDS‐PP. Nevertheless, the PSD regarded this as a major defeat due to the wide gap of 20 per cent between it and the winning Socialist Party.</p>
         
         <p>The big winners of the regional elections were the smaller parties, which were able to achieve representation in Parliament. The conservative CDS‐PP was able to win 7.9 per cent and three more seats in comparison to the elections of 2004, when the party formed an electoral coalition with the PSD. On the left, the Bloc of the Left (BE) tripled its share in comparison to 2004 and got 2.9 per cent of the vote and two seats, while the Communist‐Green electoral coalition (PCP‐PEV) returned to the legislative assembly after getting no seats in 2004. The PCP‐PEV got 3.14 per cent, but just one seat. Both left‐wing parties obtained seats from the compensatory regional constituency pool (five seats). The contest also saw the election of one member of the Monarchic People's Party (PPM) – a small party that played an important role in the coalition governments of the early 1980s in continental Portugal. One of the negative aspects of the regional elections was the low turnout of just 46.6 per cent. The high level of abstention certainly contributed to a better result for the smaller parties. The electoral results weakened the position of PSD leader Manuela Ferreira Leite and led to the resignation of regional leader Carlos Costa Neves. He was replaced by Berta Cabral.</p>

         <p>In spite of all these problems, the government of José Socrates ended the year with favourable opinion poll ratings. New PSD leader Manuela Ferreira Leite was unable to make an impact; on the contrary, opinion polls were very unfavourable. This was in no small part down to the sequence of mistakes related to the divorce law, the Azores regional statute and the regional elections in Azores. In spite of his vetoes, President Anibal Cavaco Silva had the highest approval rating of any politician and remained an important pillar of political stability in the country.</p>
