         <p>Italy is probably the only European country where politics has not been shaped in any way by the economic crisis. The dramatic downturn in GNP (−5.1 per cent at the end of 2009) did not affect the political debate. The topic rarely surfaced in the political arena, first because the centre‐right government was able to soft‐pedal the issue in the media, spreading optimism and confidence in an imminent and repeatedly announced economic recovery, and second because of the weakness of the opposition, which did not promote any initiatives while the government placed other issues on the agenda. The trade unions were bitterly divided, with the left‐oriented (and by far the largest) CGIL more militantly oriented, and the other two (CISL and UIL) more accommodating.</p>
         
         <p>Political confrontation thus had another axis around which everything rotated: Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. He was the alpha and omega of every event all throughout the year, dominating the headlines in the independent media and the main public television channels, as well as, of course, his own channels. As a result, the time devoted to the centre‐right on all television channels was dramatically greater than that devoted to the centre‐left. The Prime Minister was at centre stage not only for the usual political debate (plus his usual wrangling with the courts), but also because of two particular events.</p>
         
         <p>One occurred in April: the earthquake in central Italy which caused 289 deaths. Berlusconi immediately involved himself in the recovery planning (thanks to the skills acquired when he was in the construction industry) and projected an image of managerial efficacy and human participation. His approval ratings that month reached their highest point, jumping from 52 to 56 per cent. Moreover, for first time ever, Berlusconi participated in the commemoration of Italy's liberation from fascism (25 April 1945) in a village hit hard by the earthquake (and where the Nazis had killed many civilians during the war). The location of the G8 meeting in the main town of the area devastated by the earthquake represented another <i>coup de theatre</i> to impress world leaders and emphasise the government's role in the reconstruction – a process which at the time was not seen, as it was by the end of the year, as being plagued by problems and delays.
         </p>
         
         <p>This magic moment ended quite brutally in the face of the second event – namely the beginning of a series of sex and ethical scandals. A few weeks before the European elections, from within Berlusconi's new party, the Freedom People – Popolo della Libertà (PdL) that had celebrated its founding conference in March, and, indeed, from within the entourage of the co‐founder of the party, Gianfranco Fini, former head of National Alliance – Alleanza Nazionale (AN), there began to emerge criticism concerning the composition of electoral lists ‘full of show‐girls, with no quality other than their looks and beauty’. At the same time, Mr Berlusconi's wife reacted badly to her husband's unexplained visit to the eighteenth birthday party of a girl whom, it turned out, had taken to calling him daddy. The nature of their relationship – which was not one of father and daughter – was never fully clarified, but had clearly being going on for some time. It opened up a Pandora's box on the Prime Minister's private life. Later in the year, an escort revealed that she and others were often invited to his private residence in Rome to participate in parties. One escort had documented her visit – and her overnight stay – with an audio‐video recording and, in revenge for having been excluded from the party's list at the European elections, released it to the media.</p>
         
         <p>Those elections had already seen a drop in support for Berlusconi's party, although they had not provoked an electoral earthquake. In the autumn, however, the pressure on the Prime Minister increased when the impact of the sex scandals was heightened by his dealings with the courts. In 2008, the Italian Parliament had passed a law granting immunity from prosecution to the highest political offices, including the prime minister. In this way, Mr Berlusconi wanted to shield himself from any judicial problems – not least the trial against him and the British lawyer, David Mills, who was charged with perjury in favour of Mr Berlusconi in a multi‐million euro financial transaction. In January, the court sentenced Mr Mills to four years and six months in prison for having been corrupted; but the man doing the corrupting – Mr Berlusconi, according to the court – could not be sentenced. In October, however, the Constitutional Court declared the bill providing immunity unconstitutional and thus the trial against Berlusconi was re‐opened.</p>
         
         <p>By the end of the year, rumours of resignation were circulating and Fini seemed increasingly keen to distance himself from Mr Berlusconi. Then, however, an unaccounted, and dramatic, event occurred to turn around the political atmosphere. After a political rally in Milan, the Prime Minister was hit in his face by a metal object thrown by a mentally disturbed man. The image of the bloody visage of Berlusconi, and then his hospitalisation, provoked a wave of compassion that overwhelmed all the previous criticism. It was as if Berlusconi's suffering had helped him atone for his ‘sins’.</p>
         
         <p>The opposition parties did not play much of a role during 2009. The smaller one, the Union of Centre – Unione di Centro (UDC), which was a former ally of the centre‐right coalition, maintained its role of moderate opponent. However, by the end of the year, especially after the government proposed a bill reducing journalists' freedom to report, the UDC came closer to the other opposition parties (PD and IdV) in a sort of common front against the government. The main party of the left, the Democratic Party – Partito Democratico (PD), was shaken by internal rows all through the year and proved incapable of articulating anxiety about the economic crisis and outrage over the Prime Minister's unethical behaviour. The PD leader, Walter Veltroni, finally resigned in March. He was replaced by the vice‐secretary, Dario Franceschini, who, unlike Veltroni, who was a former communist, had a Catholic and Christian Democracy Party (DC) origin. The change seemed to revitalise the party and Franceschini. However, the earthquake in Abruzzo (and its ‘management’ by the government) reduced his room for manoeuvre.</p>
         
         <p>The PD's modest result at the European elections depressed its mood even further. After the European election, the process of selection of a new secretary through a primary contest (open to all voters) began. Three candidates threw their hats into the ring: Franceschini himself, backed by the former secretary; Ignazio Marino, an MP and a well know physician on a secular and quite radical agenda; and Pierluigi Bersani, former minister and representative of the bulk of the PCI‐PDS‐DS lineage, allied with a large component of the Catholic DC‐PPI. Bersani came out as the winner with 51 per cent of the vote. Beyond all that, once more, the mobilisation of the left‐wing voters overcame every forecast. An astonishing 3.1 million people participated in the leadership contest. Whether the party leadership would be able to capitalise on their enthusiasm, however, was a moot point.</p>
         
         <p>The third opposition party, the Italy of Values – Italia dei Valori (IdV), run by former prosecutor of the Clean Hands investigation, Antonio di Pietro, was the most vocal in confronting the government and especially the Prime Minister. Its tenacity, compared to the PD's navel gazing, was criticised by the media but rewarded by the electorate at the European elections. The other parties of the radical left did not recover from the brutal defeat of the 2008 general elections and, in addition, were not willing to merge their forces – an attitude that condemned them to the political fringes.</p>

         <p>Italy proved once more quite enthusiastic about the European elections. The turnout reached 65.1 per cent – the highest among the larger countries, even if it was 6.6 percentage point less than in 2004. As everywhere, the European elections had no European content: the campaign ranged around national issues. Since the general election had occurred the year before, the general expectation was a good score for the majority and some difficulties for the PD. In fact, the PD suffered a heavy blow, dropping 7 percentage points compared to the 2008 general election. Berlusconi's party, quite surprisingly, also reduced its share of the vote compared to the year before. The leaks about the Prime Minister's private life and the furore over the candidatures offered to the showgirls disconcerted some moderate‐Catholic voters of the party's traditional constituency. The two real winners were the most radical components in both the government majority and the opposition. On the right side, Umberto Bossi's Northern League – Lega Nord (LN) surpassed the 10 per cent threshold doubling its score compared to 2004 and with a substantial increase compared to the last general election. Its aggressive campaign against immigrants and for law and order went down well with voters. On the left side, Antonio Di Pietro's IdV collected disillusioned PD voters in search of a tougher opposition. Only another party were rewarded with MEPs: the UDC, whose moderate opposition meant its support stayed firm but did not increase. Overall, Italian representation in Strasbourg shrank dramatically: from 15 parties to just five. This was due to the new electoral law that introduced a 4 per cent threshold and to the reduction of Italy's quota of MEPs to 72 – a change which meant that the minor lists of the right and the left (and also the Radicals) gained no representation at all.</p>
