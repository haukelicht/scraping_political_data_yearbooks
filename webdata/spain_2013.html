         <p>Although economic issues were visible during 2013, other events were also included in the debate. The government of Mariano Rajoy had to fight high unemployment despite the labour market reform undertaken the previous year. Moreover, political corruption was a large concern, with scandals involving the royal family and politicians from national and regional parties. Parliament approved many laws related to the government's reforms, and it also renewed the Constitutional Court. Although there were no elections in 2013, the Catalonian parliament approved a declaration explicitly promising a self‐determination vote set for November 2014.</p>

         <p>Parliament validated 17 bills approved by the government, mostly concerned with economic and social reforms. Alongside these, the Spanish parliament passed a controversial reform of the education system, which was not backed by any other party or the vast majority of teachers' unions and associations. Only the small Spanish nationalist parties UPyD and Foro Asturias (a splinter group of the PP's regional Asturias branch) abstained. All the others voted against it. This is the first centre‐right education law to be implemented since the Transition.</p>
         
         <p>Parliament also approved 27 laws mainly linked to the government's political reforms, including the New Transparency and Access to Information Law, which aims to tackle corruption and boost democratic regeneration, and applies to all public institutions, as well as the King's House, political parties, trade unions and private entities that receive more than €100,000 per year of public money. In addition, a law to reform local administration was approved and is aimed at strengthening budgetary discipline and public transparency, streamlining the public sector, improving efficiency and the effectiveness of the public administration services, and changing the administrative culture to one focused on the beneficiary. Parliament also approved a law to improve the electricity sector. Its main goal was to limit the tariff deficit and replace the support schemes for renewable sources. Moreover, the parliament approved a market unit law that establishes the principles and rules guaranteeing the market so as to create a favourable environment for competition and investment.</p>

         <p>During 2013, Spain sought to emerge from a prolonged economic crisis. Hence the economy remained the key issue, and fixing it had an adverse effect on perceptions of democracy. The public had serious doubts about the policy response to the crisis in terms of effectiveness and burden‐sharing. The most worrisome aspect of the crisis and the one most unique to Spain is the spectacular increase in unemployment. The expected decrease in public employment as a result of fiscal consolidation added to the destruction of private‐sector jobs. Thus, the unemployment rate peaked at more than 27 per cent of the labour force. For the under‐25 age group, the figure exceeds 40 per cent. Consequently, the executive has had to confront the general impoverishment of society. Such a high increase in unemployment means a decline in the disposable income of many families, and deteriorating conditions for the lowest income groups. Although the Government claimed that ‘the worst was over’ and that Spain was on the road to recovery, there was no evidence of new jobs. Meanwhile, the black market thrived during the year, especially in those areas most affected by unemployment and the burst housing bubble. It was only thanks to the black market, along with family support and charity, that there has not been widespread social unrest.</p>
         
         <p>Although the government's adjustment package from the previous year calmed tensions in the sovereign debt markets and averted the intervention that the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) had made in other European countries, the management of the economic downturn was perceived by most citizens as erratic and contradictory, with far too much improvisation and an unfair distribution of sacrifices. It is not surprising, therefore, that this led to a simultaneous deterioration in political indicators. Confidence in government and the opposition declined over the year and most Spaniards felt pessimistic about the future. With the jobless rate still at an ‘alarming level’, unemployment remains the main problem. Survey respondents were equally downbeat about the political situation.</p>
         
         <p>After unemployment, the main concern of Spaniards is corruption. The perception of corruption had an extraordinarily strong impact in 2013. Although corruption is not very widespread (relatively few people are implicated), large sums of money are involved, affecting not only political parties but also the son‐in‐law of the King, Iñaki Urdangarín. He appeared in court accused of misusing millions of euros in public funds. Nevertheless, the great corruption scandal involved the party in government. Newspapers published handwritten ledgers from a former party treasurer, Luis Bárcenas, which showed payments through secret accounts from managers of building companies to members of the party, including President Rajoy. The affair was seen as breaking Rajoy's control of parliament or as grounds for an early election as demanded by the Socialist opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba. In response to allegations of political corruption, Rajoy defended his reputation and denied he or his party had accepted illegal payments, though opposition leaders called for him to quit. Rajoy faced an unprecedented crisis of national confidence and the scandal damaged his credibility and eroded voter support for the PP.</p>
         
         <p>Corruption scandals also affected regional parliaments. The son of the former president of the Catalan government, Jordi Pujol, who was regional deputy and general secretary of the Catalan Nationalist Coalition (CiU), resigned after being charged of bribery in several public concessions. Corruption scandals also involved the Andalusian Socialist government. Citing the need for a generational change, Socialist José Antonio Griñán stepped down as premier, but in fact, the Andalusian government was hit by a scandal involving the misappropriation of public subsidies for struggling businesses (the ERE case). Griñán's decision was seen as a way to ensure a new party leader was in place in case he had to call early elections. Susana Díaz, 39 year‐old chief of the premier's office and regional equality commissioner, became the first woman premier in Andalusia – a Socialist stronghold for 31 years. Also in this region, the biggest corruption case in the history of Spanish trade unions took place. The Andalusian chapter of the left‐leaning General Union of Workers (UGT) was accused of misusing at least €1.8 million in public money intended to develop training programmes for unemployed workers. Although the union denied any wrongdoing, the scandal led to the resignation of the union's regional head and a judge opened a criminal investigation into the chapter's finances. An additional corruption scandal in Andalusia centred on whether the region's governing Socialist politicians, in concert with union officials, paid millions in fictitious early retirement benefits to affiliates and family relatives in Andalusia.</p>
         
         <p>Recent corruption scandals involving both left‐wing and right‐wing parties prompted Spain's government to propose a law to control party finances more tightly. The law bans legal and corporate entities from donating to parties, and banks may no longer cancel their debts or offer them discounted interest rates. Senior officials in the state administration must file a declaration listing their assets and wealth.</p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, the aforementioned scandals affected Rajoy's struggles to combat a deep recession, a huge budget hole, high unemployment, sporadic protests against cuts in health and education spending, and a growing separatist movement in Catalonia. In January, the Regional Parliament of Catalonia approved the ‘Declaration of sovereignty and the right to decide of the Catalan people’, facilitating a self‐determination referendum. The text was supported by 63 per cent of parliament. Support came from the centre‐right Catalan Nationalist Coalition (CiU), the left‐wing Catalan Independence Party (ERC), the Catalan Green Socialist and Communist Coalition (ICV‐EUiA) and the radical left‐wing and independence party CUP. The CiU has run Catalonia since 2010, and the ERC offers the CiU stable parliamentary support. Both parties held talks with the ICV‐EUiA, the CUP and the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) to gather greater support. The day before the vote, the PSC registered its own declaration, stating Catalans' right to self‐determination within the Spanish legal framework. The CiU, ERC and ICV‐EUiA's text declared Catalonia a ‘sovereign political and legal entity’, while the Spanish constitution states that ‘sovereignty is rooted in the whole of the Spanish people’. This was too much for the PSC and they decided to vote against the declaration presented by the other parties, although five of their members abstained, alongside two MPs from the radical independence CUP</p>
         
         <p>In December, the regional president announced the questions for the referendum to be held in November 2014. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Catalans held hands in a 400‐km (250‐mile) human chain across their region on Catalan national day (11 September), aiming to draw international attention to the independence movement. Catalan separatists were watching closely a planned September 2014 Scottish referendum on independence from the United Kingdom, hoping it will promote self‐determination for regions within EU countries. Demonstrators highlighted the deep recession and cuts in public spending taken by regional government and also showed discontent with the central government in Madrid. They wanted to press the Spanish government to let them vote on breaking away and forming their own country. Rajoy indicated that a referendum on Catalan independence would be unconstitutional and pledged to block it in the courts. Hence, Catalan President Mas threatened to call an early election and use it as a plebiscite on secession. This is seen as a risky move because it could spur protests in other autonomous regions such as the Basque Country. That is why Rajoy has offered Catalonia better fiscal treatment.</p>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, the tension between Madrid and Catalonia reached a new peak with the announcement by the Catalan president that he plans to hold an independence referendum on 9 November 2014. Flanked by leaders of parties that hold two‐thirds of seats in the region's parliament, President Mas launched the biggest challenge to Spain's internal structure in recent history. Rajoy's position on Catalonia had the backing of the Socialists, who also rejected the proposed referendum. And even within the CiU there is a strong sector opposed to outright independence. With his coalition divided, President Mas was increasingly dependent on the separatist ERC for support. ERC props up his minority government and would have forced elections if he had reneged on his promise of a referendum on independence next year. The independence row has fractured Catalan politics, driving voters towards parties more clearly defined as pro‐ or anti‐independence. President Mas is expected to declare the next Catalan regional elections as a plebiscite on independence, but they elections might not be held until 2016. It is impossible to predict the outcome, especially as the national government may have changed by then.</p>
         
         <p>Also at the end of the year the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered the release of an ETA member. The ECHR also told Madrid to pay €30,000 in compensation to Ines del Rio, who was jailed in 1989 for her role in 23 assassinations and car bombings by the Basque independence movement ETA. Del Rio had been scheduled for early release in 2008, but courts extended her detention and those of dozens of other ETA members. Upholding an earlier ruling that Spain had appealed, judges at the ECHR overwhelmingly decided her rights had been violated by the retroactive changes to sentencing rules. Groups representing victims of political violence called on the government not to comply with the sentence and not to allow it to set a precedent.</p>
         
         <p>Spanish Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz‐Gallardón said Spain's High Court would have to go through dozens of cases to see if anyone else would have to be released. About 600 ETA members are in prison in Spain. Of those, 61 have had their early release cancelled. ETA, which killed more than 800 people over more than four decades, many with car bombs, proclaimed a unilateral ceasefire two years ago. The group has been severely weakened by hundreds of arrests and flagging political and social support in the Basque Country.</p>
         
         <p>A conflict in Gibraltar caused some tension between Spain and Britain. The 1.2‐km border between Spain and Gibraltar has been a frequent source of conflict with Britain in its three centuries of sovereignty over the territory. Fishing rows and disputed waters are among the biggest sources of conflict. This boiled over in late July when boats from Gibraltar dumped concrete blocks into the bay to form an artificial reef. As a consequence, small commercial fishing boats that regularly cross into Gibraltar waters to fish could not access that area. In retaliation for this environmental disaster, Spain implemented a sporadic ‘go slow’ policy at the narrow border crossing, occasionally causing long delays to border checks against smuggling and tax evasion. Britain demanded that the European Commission urgently send a team of monitors to see whether the tight controls broke European Union law. Officials from the European Commission found no evidence that they did. Gibraltar is not part of the EU's Schengen Area, so travellers between Spain and Gibraltar are subject to passport and customs checks. The EU recommended practical ways to improve the flow of people through the border crossing.</p>

            <p>The renewal this year of the Constitutional Court (TC) produced an ideological shift in Spain's top legal body from progressive leftists to the right. The General Council of the Judicial Power (CGPJ) named two magistrates to the 12‐member bench, while the government also provided two and will name a new president soon – the first such instance since 2004. The cabinet put forward Pedro González‐Trevijano, a law professor, and High Court Judge Enrique López – both conservative. The appointees replace progressive magistrates Manuel Aragón and Pablo Pérez Tremps. The CGPJ selected José Antonio Xiol, a progressive and president of the Civil Law chamber of the Supreme Court, and Santiago Martínez Vares, a litigious judge in the Supreme Court's administrative chamber. Moreover, in November, PP, PSOE, CiU, PNV and IU agreed on the renovation of the CGPJ. The law clearly states that the CGPJ president is freely chosen by members of the council, but traditionally presidents alternate between the government and opposition. The only exception is the current President, Gonzalo Moliner, chosen a year ago after the resignation of Carlos Divar, who had been nominated by President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.</p>

            <p>A new political party, <i>Partido X</i>, emerged from the social protests, and is aimed at breaking the political hegemony of the PP and PSOE who have lost voters since the crisis began. <i>Partido X</i> positions itself as a force for political change. Like many new parties, it is light on policy proposals in some areas, but has its sights set on tackling fraud and corruption, and proposes more participatory democracy, with regular referendums. The party promises to provide financial aid for Spain's small businesses, increase the minimum wage and introduce a maximum wage. These, and various other measures, may be dismissed by the financial sector, but could appeal to those left on the margins. Unlike traditional parties in Spain, <i>Partido X</i> understands the power of the Internet, and its members have used social media to spread their message and gather funds and ideas. The party refuses, however, to state whether it is left or right. It describes itself as ‘progressive’ – a rejection of old‐style politics. <i>Partido X</i> had not yet committed to fielding candidates in the 2014 European elections or 2015 general election, but believes it could have millions of supporters by then – mainly disaffected voters. Simona Levi, actor and long‐time political activist, has become a spokeswoman for the party. <i>Partido X</i> eschews traditional forms of leadership, but Levi is an increasingly recognisable face. The party is supported by Hervé Falciani, a whistle‐blower on tax evasion in Switzerland. An adviser is Tarso Genro, governor of the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul and ally of ex‐President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
