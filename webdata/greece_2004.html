         <p>On 8 February 2005, the Greek parliament elected Karolos Papoulias as the new President of the Republic with a record 279 votes (ND and PASOK). This unprecedented show of unanimity had nothing to do with his personal qualities or popularity. To avoid premature elections in case no candidate received the required 180 votes, Prime Minister Karamanlis came up in December 2004 with a name that George A. Papandreou could not possibly refuse since Papoulias had been a loyal crony of Papandreou's father and a trusted friend of the family. Nobody seemed bothered by the odd fact that the wife and children of the new head of state reside permanently in Germany.</p>
         
         <p>For his part, Papandreou completed the restructuring of the party according to his wishes. On 20 February, 4,000 delegates to the PASOK Congress were elected by 303,000 people. Of these, only 45 per cent were party members, while the remaining 55 per cent were ‘friends’, including immigrants (i.e., non‐citizens). The PASOK Congress was eventually held in early March, with 5,628 participants. The party's Central Committee was replaced by a National Council twice as big. Of its 300 members, half were appointed <i>ex officio</i> and half were elected by the delegates, with a fixed quota for women (40 per cent). Of those elected (90 men and 60 women), about 50 per cent were new faces. All factions and currents were represented. The Party Executive was replaced by a Political Council of 20 members. Out of the 20 nominated by Papandreou, 17 were duly elected. His choice as new Party Secretary (Marilisa Xenogiannakopoulou) was also approved by an overwhelming 82 per cent.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, in February, an avalanche of judicial and church scandals began, involving corrupt judges, bishops and peculiar clergymen. It was to occupy public opinion for the rest of the year. The popularity of Archbishop Christodoulos inevitably suffered and opinion polls indicated, for the first time ever, a popular majority for the separation of Church and State (see, on this issue, <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2003</a></span>). Nevertheless, Christodoulos and his entourage were eventually successful in containing the crisis, sacrificing a few scapegoats in the process.
         </p>
         
         <p>Following a perfunctory debate (in contrast to what happened in other Member States), the Greek parliament approved the European Union (EU) constitutional treaty on 19 April by an overwhelming majority of 268 (ND and PASOK) against only 17 (KKE and SYN). Nonetheless, 135 MPs demanded that there also be a popular referendum, although 180 are constitutionally required for this. These included 115 PASOK, 12 KKE, 6 SYN and 2 independents elected on PASOK tickets. It was obvious that their only common denominator was the wish to embarrass the Karamanlis Government at a time of waning popularity.</p>
         
         <p>To redress public finances, the government was forced to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate by 1 per cent in May. Moreover, its image was also marred by various ethics issues that kept cropping up. Its deteriorating image spurred the government into action against vested interests in the public sector, starting with telecommunications (OTE, on which see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 1997</a></span>: 7–9). By striking an overgenerous deal providing for early retirement of OTE employees, it was successful in splitting PASKE (PASOK's party organization in the unions), embarrassing PASOK and regaining public confidence. On 8 June, Papandreou reacted with a motion of no confidence against Minister of the Economy and Finance G. Alogoskoufis. This is a procedure rarely invoked against individual ministers, and was last used in 1999 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2000</a></span>: 399). Once again, Papandreou was outmaneuvered by Prime Minister Karamanlis, who demanded and got a resounding vote of confidence on 12 June.

         <p>In May 2005, the special court with jurisdiction over elections suddenly upset established practice by ruling that blank ballots must be counted for the allocation of seats according to the corrected proportional system in force. The practice of assimilating blanks to invalid ballots was ruled unconstitutional. Although the ruling technically applied to a single district, it had a domino effect that increased ND seats by one at the expense of PASOK, and sent the Prime Minister's uncle A. Karamanlis to parliament. Although he later resigned his seat, the ruling remained a time bomb for future elections.</p>
         
         <p>It has often been said that Karamanlis imitates the tactical successes of his opponents. He imitated the tactics of Simitis in 1999 by proposing Papoulias as President of the Republic and thereby averting the automatic dissolution of parliament. He also imitated the tactics of A. Papandreou in 1995 by suddenly proposing a new constitutional revision at the end of the annual parliamentary debate on the budget in late December 2005. The only concrete reason for initiating another revision right after the previous one (completed in 2001) seemed to concern private universities, which are constitutionally prohibited in Greece.</p>
