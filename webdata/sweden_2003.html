         <p>After the dramatic and traumatic year 2003, when the Euro was resoundingly rejected in a referendum and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was assassinated, 2004 was more low‐key. The Social Democratic Party continued as a single‐party minority government, relying on parliamentary support from the Left and Green parties. This arrangement, in place since the 1998 election, has survived longer than expected. Still, there are built‐in tensions, which were increasingly apparent towards the end of 2004. In addition, the Social Democrats were showing signs of weariness. This was reflected in a disappointing performance in the election to the European Parliament (EP), as well as in negative poll ratings for the party and its leader, Prime Minister Göran Persson. Meanwhile, the four opposition parties were busy preparing a coordinated effort to unseat the Social Democrats in the election scheduled for 2006.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Elections to the European Parliament</h2>
         
         <p>On Sunday, 13 June, Sweden held its third EP election after a fairly lacklustre campaign. The participation rate of 37.9 per cent continued a negative trend for European Union (EU) elections, and was well below the overall turnout of 45.5 per cent. The Social Democratic strategy, to attack the opposition parties from the left, was not successful. Among other things, the party expressed reservations against a draft proposal of the EU service directive, presented by the EU commission early in the year. Emanating from the so‐called ‘Lisbon goal’, set in 2000 to make the EU the world's most competitive economy by 2010, the directive is an attempt to create a harmonised framework across the EU for service providers. The Social Democrats argued that the draft directive threatened to undermine Swedish labour market agreements and regulations. In an attempt to appease trade unions and EU sceptics within the party, the Social Democrats attacked the Moderate Party for supporting the directive.</p>
         
         <p>The Social Democratic result of 24.8 per cent was the party's worst performance in a nationwide election since the introduction of universal male suffrage. The party's split on EU‐related issues, a major factor in the Euro referendum, continues to be a source of unrest. EU sceptics criticised the fact that only EU‐positive candidates were placed in high positions on the party list (all parties presented one list for the whole country). The controversy was highlighted by the case of Anna Hedh. An EU critic, Hedh had been placed as number 31 of 35 candidates on the Social Democratic list, but she conducted a personal campaign in which she presented herself as the EU‐critical alternative and received enough personal preferences to get elected.<a href="#en1" class="scrollableLink"><sup>1</sup></a> However, the opposition parties also performed disappointingly. The Moderate Party was not able to capitalise on the Social Democratic problems. The People's Party Liberals and the Christian Democrats also lost support, but for the latter party, the results were a relief, opinion polls having indicated that it might lose its representation. The only established party to buck the negative trend was the Centre Party, which registered a small increase compared to 1999. The Centre Party had been active in the ‘No’ campaign in the Euro referendum, but now presented an essentially pro‐EU message, arguing for a common EU defence policy and a division of power between EU institutions and the Member States.
         </p>
         
         <p>With the pro‐EU but anti‐Euro Centre Party as a marginal exception, the EU‐positive parties suffered losses. However, the unequivocally EU‐critical and anti‐Euro Left and Green parties also fared badly. On the other hand, the only real success story was the EU‐critical June List. Formed in February 2004, the June List was initiated by independents from the ‘No’ campaign in the Euro referendum. The party's eight candidates represented a broad range of political and professional backgrounds. The chairman and top candidate, Nils Lundgren, is a former chief economist at the Nordea Bank and a longstanding member of the Social Democrats, without having held senior positions in, or on behalf of, the party (he was threatened with expulsion due to his candidacy for the June List). The June List is opposed to the Euro and the proposed new EU constitution, but does not advocate Sweden leaving the EU. It has not politicised immigration, and the criticism of the established parties is relatively mild‐mannered in comparison to several EU‐critical parties in other countries. Despite its comparatively moderate programme, however, it seemed clear that the June List owed much of its success to anti‐establishment protest votes. The rationale behind the formation of the party was that EU critics not supporting the Green or Left parties needed a platform. Partly in order to avoid infiltrators and extremists, the June List is organised as an Internet‐based network, without a traditional party organisation.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Aside from the election, other EU‐related issues played a key role in the political debate. A hotly debated topic was transitional regulations for immigrants from the new EU Member States after enlargement on 1 May 2004. The Social Democratic government had previously declared that it would not introduce any restrictions on immigration from the new EU nations, but reconsidered this view when other ‘old’ member nations declared their intentions to introduce transitional regulations. The fear was that migrants would enter Sweden to benefit from the welfare system. The government proposed, among other things, that employment in Sweden for ‘new’ EU citizens be subject to a work permit, only issued to those who could produce an offer of full‐time employment. There seemed to be a clear parliamentary majority in favour of regulations, with the Moderates and the People's Party Liberals expressing similar ideas. However, these parties chose to present different proposals, with less rigorous control systems. In the end, despite attempts to reach a compromise, no proposal was accepted by Parliament. Thus, Sweden joined a minority of ‘old’ EU countries without transitional regulations on immigration from the ‘new’ countries. Another difficult issue for the government was the proposal for a new EU constitution, finally agreed in June 2004. The government supports the proposal, despite question marks regarding, for example, the implications for Swedish security policy. The government declared that it will not subject the constitution to a referendum.</p>
         
         <p>Two parties changed leaders in 2004. The Left Party congress appointed Lars Ohly leader in February after a period of interim leadership following Gudrun Schyman's resignation in 2003. The Left Party is split between socialist ‘traditionalists’ and pragmatic ‘renewers’. Ohly belongs to the former faction, and calls himself a communist (claiming to represent a different form of communism from that of the Soviet Union), but is positive toward cooperation with the government and the Green Party. However, his appointment led to internal unrest, and there were several reports of ‘renewers’ leaving the party. Indeed, former leader Gudrun Schyman announced in December that she was leaving the party, and would sit in Parliament as an independent. There were suggestions that she was planning the formation of a feminist party. Meanwhile, Göran Hägglund succeeded Alf Svensson as leader of the Christian Democrats at a party congress in April. In charge since 1973, Svensson had taken his party from its position as a primarily Free‐Church‐based extra‐parliamentary minnow to an established member of the non‐socialist ‘bourgeois’ bloc. In the process, he became one of the country's most popular politicians. Hägglund's appointment was widely regarded as representing political continuity. At least initially, however, he lacked Svensson's charisma, and the party slumped in the polls following his appointment.</p>
         
         <p>The four‐party opposition bloc, consisting of the Moderates, People's Party Liberals, Centre Party and Christian Democrats, started preparations for the election scheduled for September 2006. The coordination effort was given the label ‘Alliance for Sweden’. Six working groups were formed with a view to a government programme in the 2006 election. There are many issue areas where the opposition parties differ, but there were signs towards the end of 2004 that the opposition parties were growing in confidence. A contributory factor seems to have been the de‐radicalisation of the Moderate Party. Fredrik Reinfeldt, Moderate Party leader since 2003, has moved his party towards the middle by, for example, toning down earlier demands for tax cuts. The public response was positive and Reinfeldt's party improved steadily in the polls despite disappointment in the EU election. In the second half of 2004, several polls reported that the opposition parties had more support than the government bloc, while Prime Minister Göran Persson saw his popularity decline.</p>
         
         <p>The main budget, presented to Parliament on 20 September, was agreed after tough negotiations between the government and the Left and Green support parties. Especially the Left Party was difficult to get on board, and only did so after a last minute promise of more money to local and regional councils. The budget contained a number of unpopular measures, including increased road and fuel taxes. On the other hand, there were tax cuts, including lower income tax for low and medium earners and elimination of taxes on inheritance and gifts. There were increases in, for example, child allowances, parental benefits and foreign aid. The expansionism relied on the belief that the economy had taken a positive turn. Certainly, GDP grew by 2.9 per cent in 2004, an improvement of 1.3 percentage points compared to 2003, according to a report published in March 2005 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER). A marginal increase to 3.0 per cent was projected for 2005.</p>
         
         <p>The opposition parties argued that the budget was not funded. The government envisaged loans amounting to SEK200 billion (approx. €22 billion) up to 2007 in order to pay for the measures which, according to the opposition, were taken with eyes set on the 2006 election. According to figures presented in January 2005, the fiscal deficit for 2004 amounted to SEK55 billion (approx. €6 billion), or 2 per cent of GDP. The national debt amounted to SEK1,257 billion (approx. €140 billion), or 49 per cent of GDP. Another problem was the fact that unemployment stayed above the government target of 4 per cent. According to statistics from the Swedish National Labour Market Administration, the annual average unemployment for 2004 was 5.4 per cent of the workforce, compared to 5.0 in 2003. A further 2.4 per cent were involved in labour market schemes, which meant a total unemployment rate of 7.7 per cent – an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2003. Inflation declined, constantly staying below the <i>Riksbanken</i>'s (central bank) target of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly rate of inflation (12 month changes in the Consumer Price Index) never exceeded 0.8 per cent.

         <p>The death of his likely successor Anna Lindh meant that Göran Persson was more or less forced to carry on as party leader and Prime Minister, at least until the 2006 election. In preparation for the election, Persson announced a major reshuffle on 21 October, but other changes had been made earlier. In total, there were four departures and the same number of new entries, plus several internal moves. The gender balance remained 50 per cent, while the average age went down in comparison to 2003 to 46.9 years (figures from 31 December each year).</p>
         
         <p>The departures were largely uncontroversial. Gunnar Lund had concentrated on issues related to European Monetary Union (EMU) and was considered redundant after the rejection of the Euro. Lars‐Erik Lövdén was considered a limited success as Minister for Housing and Local Government. Lars Engqvist, Minister for Social Welfare, was criticised for failure to deliver major social reforms. Before departing, however, Engqvist served four months as Deputy Prime Minister, a post that had been abolished in 2003, but was re‐instated from the start of June. All three were lined up for prestigious non‐political positions. The fourth departure was the Minister for Culture, the EMU‐critical Marita Ulvskog. She took the important, and difficult, position as secretary of the Social Democratic Party in order to appease EU sceptics in the party. The newcomers were Jens Orback (whose portfolio includes gender equality and ethnic integration), Sven‐Erik Österberg (local government and financial markets), Ibrahim Baylan (schools and comprehensive education) and Ylva Johansson (health and care of elderly). Johansson had previously served as Minister for Schools between 1994 and 1998. Baylan, born in the Kurdish part of Turkey, is the first immigrant Swedish minister. A notable absentee from government was Margot Wallström. Sweden's representative on the EU commission since 1999, Wallström was offered a place in government by Persson in the spring of 2004. To Persson's dismay she declined, preferring to stay on the commission. Persson eventually nominated Wallström for a second term as commissioner, but there were media reports of a rivalry between the two. Wallström is regarded by some as a possible successor to Persson.</p>
         
         <p>At least as important as the entries and departures were the internal moves. Pär Nuder was appointed to the key post as Minister of Finance. An educated lawyer, Nuder was first appointed to government as recently as in 2002, but has extensive experience from more junior positions in the government organisation. His predecessor Bosse Ringholm became Deputy Prime Minister. Mona Sahlin was moved from the Department of Industry, Employment and Communication to take charge of the Ministry of Environment, which was, on 1 January 2005, re‐created into a Ministry for Sustainable Development. Lena Sommestad stayed as Minister for the Environment, but lost the position as head of ministry. Thomas Östros was moved from education to head the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communication, exchanging positions with Leif Pagrotsky, who was also charged with culture. Pagrotsky heads the new Ministry of Education and Culture, created as of 1 January 2005. Most commentators did not interpret the October reshuffle as a major change of political direction, although critics in the Social Democratic Party claimed that the government had moved to the right. Another criticism was the loose link between government and parliament. In total, 11 out of 22 ministers after the October reshuffle had been elected to Parliament in the 2002 election (one other member having earlier parliamentary experience).</p>
