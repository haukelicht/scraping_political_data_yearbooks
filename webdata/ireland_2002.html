         <p>This promised to be an exciting year in Irish politics and a difficult year for the Government. Dissatisfaction with the Government for allegedly misleading the electorate about the state of the public finances seemed to offer an opening for the new leaders of the major opposition parties and the new opposition parties to make their mark. Yet 2003 was a relatively quiet year.</p>
         
         <p>While it was by no means easy for the Government or its <i>Taoiseach</i> (Prime Minister), Bertie Ahern, the opposition failed to damage Government morale. In fact most of Ahern's major headaches came from within his own party: Fianna Fáil, the major Government party, showed uncharacteristic lack of discipline by displaying its divisions openly. Rumours abounded that Ahern might be deposed as he no longer seemed Fianna Fáil's prime electoral asset. The high profile wedding of his daughter to a pop star, which featured in the United Kingdom edition of <i>Hello</i>! magazine, made his claims to be an ordinary Dubliner look baseless. He was loudly booed at a high‐profile Gaelic football match. By the end of the year, Ahern had to make three pleas to his party for loyalty in as many months.
         </p>
         
         <p>A number of policy issues highlighted the dissatisfaction with the Government generally, and more interestingly, among the Government backbenches. The threatened reduction of funding for a Community Employment Scheme (CES), which pays otherwise unemployed people a supplement to work on various projects in their community, was unpopular. A former cabinet minister led backbench opposition by accusing the government of losing touch with ordinary people.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The Defence Minister, Michael Smith, publicly criticised Government‐approved proposals for reform of the health services. When his comments to a constituency meeting outlining his opposition to the reform were publicised, Ahern was slow to reprimand him. The event not only made a mockery of the principle of collective cabinet responsibility, but also showed Ahern to be a weakened <i>Taoiseach</i>. In his eventual letter to the <i>Taoiseach</i>, the minister did not withdraw the remarks: he merely apologised for any embarrassment caused. Ahern's failure to reprimand Smith caused annoyance to Government backbenchers asked to sell the policy in the country and to the Minister for Health, Micheál Martin, who expected cabinet unity on the issue to be enforced.
         </p>
         
         <p>The proposed ban on smoking in public places, including bars and hotels, also caused revolt. Micheál Martin once again looked to the <i>Taoiseach</i> for backing and, once again, received only equivocal support. However, if opposition to the reorganisation of hospitals and the CES was based on genuine concern for the opinions of their constituents, backbench opposition to the ban on smoking was purely self‐interested. TDs (MPs) in Ireland have close connections with the licensed vintners’ trade. Many TDs are publicans themselves and most TDs use bars as meeting rooms and constituency clinics. The minister's failure to get the <i>Taoiseach</i>'s unqualified support just gave encouragement to those TDs.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government had difficulties with the wider public about the use of Shannon Airport as a refuelling stop by American military planes en route to the Middle East. Polls make it clear that a majority of people in Ireland were against the invasion of Iraq. An anti‐war protest in February brought over 100,000 people onto the streets of Dublin. Given that the organisers only predicted 20,000 marchers, this was an impressive turnout. The size of the protest failed to change the stance of the Government, who were no doubt anxious not to upset American interests in Ireland. Despite this, by the end of 2003, the Government managed to claim that it was anti‐war all along.</p>
         
         <p>By the end of the year, the economy provided some good news for the Government. The growth rate was above the European Union average. The predicted crisis in the public finances never materialised. This raised suspicions that the Government had forecast the crisis to curtail spending and also make the eventual budgetary figures appear to be an improvement on the forecasts. In the budget, the Government also announced a broad programme of decentralisation of whole government departments out of Dublin. This move was broadly welcomed in the areas identified as possible centres for decentralisation.</p>
         
         <p>The success of Sinn Féin in the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly worried all the parties, but especially Fianna Fáil, who were seen as particularly vulnerable electorally. The local elections in 2004 may give Sinn Féin an even stronger base to fight the next general election. Sinn Féin's popularity, measured in opinion polls, rose in 2003, as did the Labour Party’s. This was mainly at the expense of Fianna Fáil.</p>
         
         <p>Opposition parties failed to embarrass the Government in spite of the favourable circumstances. The new leaders of Fine Gael and Labour spent the year finding their feet in their new jobs. Perhaps because the next general election was not likely until 2006, at the earliest, the leaders decided not to waste too much ammunition on the Government now, but to spend their time in re‐organising their own parties for the interim elections in 2004. It seems evident that most parties have succeeded in increasing their membership – Fine Gael, in particular – and it remains to be seen if this will have much impact on either turnout or the respective parties’ electoral success.</p>
         
         <p>In preparation for these elections, the new boundaries for the European Parliament elections were set by the Boundary Commission in the autumn. It opted to retain four constituencies, although the number of Irish seats was reduced, due to enlargement, from 15 to 13. Some of the new electoral legislation introduced before the 2002 election was also tested in the courts. In the King case, the requirement for 30 signatures as a means of ensuring a candidate's <i>bona fides</i> was found to be reasonable, as was the exemption for registered parties from this requirement. The law requiring candidates to declare all campaign expenditure and keep spending within set limits was also explored in the Sinnott case, although the court found that the Minister for Health, Micheál Martin, had not overspent as Sinnott claimed. Even so, the way in which spending is allocated between candidates and parties is likely to be made more transparent in future.
