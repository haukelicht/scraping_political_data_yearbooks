         <p>In January 2007, a rocket launched at the United States Embassy in Athens apparently sought to destroy the complacent assurance that domestic terrorism had ended with the trial and incarceration of the ‘17 November’ group in 2003 (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2004</a></span>: 1015). There was no sequel, however. During February, several votes in the parliamentary committee on proposed constitutional changes revealed that not only PASOK, but also ND, was divided on key issues. Procedural dirty tricks by ND provided a welcome pretext for Papandreou to withdraw from the constitutional debate and ask for elections (which in practice would imply starting all over again). This was a major setback for the Government's project of constitutional revision since it ended the prospect of mustering the required majority of 180. The Government persisted, nonetheless, in the vain hope that such a majority would materialise in the next parliament, and kept denouncing Papandreou's gross inconsistency, especially on the issue of allowing private universities.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, the conflict over university reform (<span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2007</a></span>: 963–964) resumed and escalated, with ‘occupations’ again paralysing the universities, and weekly demonstrations paralysing the centre of Athens. Occupations served to mask the fact that only a minority of the faculty was willing to strike. That minority continued to receive full pay, since they, like everybody else, were in any case prevented by brute force from doing their work. On the other hand, demonstrations became increasingly violent since they allowed anarchist groups to attack the police and torch buildings. This culminated in the desecration of the Monument to the Unknown Soldier in early March. The police appeared reluctant or, in any case, unable to control the situation. An added obstacle was the so‐called ‘university asylum’ (instituted by PASOK in 1982), which prevents the police from entering university grounds without the consent of the university authorities (which is practically never given). Once again, this served as a sanctuary for both occupiers and anarchist commandos. Nevertheless, the Government was unwilling to go beyond minor procedural changes on this critical issue. More generally, the new university law was far less comprehensive and radical than the reform actually required, which could have hardly generated more opposition. A set of half‐measures had an exorbitant cost in terms of social upheaval, which subsided only in late March after the new law was passed. The lingering war between the anarchists and the police was to flare up again in May with a series of raids on police posts.

         <p>The next crisis faced by the Government was a scandal over dubious investments by pension funds (whose administrators are mostly appointed by the Government). The uproar centred on the hapless S. Tsitouridis, Minister of Employment, who was forced to resign for the second time in his career (cf. <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2005</a></span>: 1032) because of one of his associates. On 30 April, he was replaced by V. Magginas.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another issue in education was the uproar caused by a new history textbook for elementary schools. Ill‐conceived and poorly written, it was widely denounced as anti‐national and unpatriotic, and was to cost Minister of Education M. Giannakou her parliamentary seat in the next election.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The parliamentary election of 16 September 2007</h2>
         
         <p>On 16 August, Prime Minister Karamanlis announced the premature dissolution of parliament and the holding of elections on 16 September. Once again, the official pretext given was hardly convincing, and once again the constitutional clause seeking to limit the abuse of dissolution proved ineffective. Evidently, Karamanlis sought to pre‐empt the further erosion of electoral support for his government, and ensure the shortest possible electoral campaign. In fact, the campaign was shortened even further by an unprecedented wave of destructive forest fires, which swept Southern Greece in the latter half of August and completely sidetracked the electoral contest. Despite official allusions to a sinister plot, the protracted natural disaster created a universal impression of state inefficiency and incompetence, at the expense of both major parties, and to the benefit of minor parties, which have never been in government (except for a brief spell in 1989). Nevertheless, the Karamanlis Government was able to redress the situation, at least in part, by the swift payment of compensation to those affected. In the remaining first half of September, the PASOK campaign was characterised by blunders, ineffectual personal attacks against Karamanlis, and the almost childish posturing of Papandreou as ‘the next Prime Minister’, outbidding ND in electoral promises of all kinds.</p>
         
         <p>The issue that came to dominate the last days of the campaign was whether a single‐party majority would result from the election, which was to be held under a new version of ‘corrected’ proportional representation (PR), originally voted by the PASOK majority before 2004, and making it harder for the party with a plurality of votes to achieve a majority in seats. Karamanlis judiciously emphasised that conditions for a coalition government simply did not exist, and that a new election would become inevitable if this one failed to produce a parliamentary majority. Fear of such an outcome no doubt stemmed the erosion of ND support, and secured a bare majority of 152 seats. In effect, Karamanlis proved his staying power, and was given a ‘second chance’ to implement his programme of reforms. Otherwise, however, the electoral outcome signified widespread dissatisfaction, if not exasperation, with both major parties (ND and PASOK), which have alternated in power since 1974. Not only did PASOK not benefit from ND losses, it also dropped to its lowest vote share since 1981. Together, the two major parties lost 6 per cent, to the benefit of the three minor parties, on both ends of the party spectrum (KKE and SYRIZA on the left, LAOS on the right). These three also profited from the demise of DIKKI (which had polled 1.8 per cent in 2004). Beneficiaries of what was essentially a protest vote, all three could feel vindicated in their diverse respective perspectives: the KKE for its hard orthodox line, SYRIZA for its unreserved sponsorship of the violent opposition to university reform, and LAOS for its ultranationalist and populist positions. LAOS was no doubt the most successful minor party since it won parliamentary representation at last (and was to make full use of it). Remarkably, this was regarded as a positive development by a majority of public opinion. Finally, another sign of widespread disaffection with the existing party system was the increase in abstention by an estimated 2.6 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The overall electoral outcome should not mask the sharply divergent choices made by younger and especially new voters (see the Public Issue/VPRC exit poll in <i>Kathimerini</i>, 18 September 2007). Among the latter, PASOK triumphed over ND, with 42 per cent against 32 per cent. SYRIZA also won 10 per cent, twice its overall strength. This was probably a consequence of the bitter conflict over university reform, indicating that it had opened an ominous gap between the ND Government and the younger generation. As the following months would show, SYRIZA was far better prepared than PASOK to exploit this gap and the apparent radicalisation of youth.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Government and Opposition</h2>
         
         <p>The new Karamanlis Government was sworn in on 19 September, and received a vote of confidence in the early hours of 1 October. The catchphrase calling for a ‘small and flexible’ cabinet had remained a dead letter for many years. This time, at least, two ministries were fused with others (Public Order with Interior, and Aegean with Merchant Marine) reducing the number of ministerial posts by two. On the other hand, the creation of a new Ministry for the Environment, universally demanded in the wake of the August catastrophe, was postponed because of the stubborn opposition of G. Souflias, Minister of Environment, Planning and Public Works.</p>
         
         <p>In its composition, the new Karamanlis Government reflected a balanced mix of continuity and renewal: nine ministers (including the Prime Minister), amounting to one half of the new cabinet, retained their posts; two (M. Liapis and G. Voulgarakis) were moved around; three hitherto vice‐ministers (Chr. Folias, A. Kontos and E. Stylianidis) were promoted; and four new faces entered the Government as ministers (K. Hatzidakis, S. Hatzigakis, A. Spiliotopoulos and M. Tzimas) and 13 more as vice‐ministers. Among those leaving the cabinet, Dimitris Sioufas, hitherto Minister of Development and a trusted associate of the Prime Minister, was to become the Speaker of the new Parliament. The former Minister of Education M. Giannakou and one of her vice‐ministers were not re‐elected, paying the price of the controversies in education. The colourful former Minister of Public Order V. Polydoras, although re‐elected, also paid the price of his consistently unfortunate pronouncements.</p>
         
         <p>On the whole, the new government was well‐received, and no one appeared disturbed by the sharp reduction in the number of women from three (four if one includes the Speaker of Parliament) to one (plus a single vice‐minister). ND managed to project initially an image of a dynamic new beginning, despite its reduced parliamentary majority. Nevertheless, this image soon faded away as the Government was not prepared to move swiftly on its agenda, and benefit from PASOK's disarray. Shaken by its second consecutive electoral defeat, PASOK entered a protracted and bitter crisis. On the night of the election, Papandreou stated that he would seek confirmation of his leadership. Immediately, Evangelos Venizelos (no relation to the great statesman Eleftherios Venizelos) announced his challenge in the most aggressive manner, as befits his character. A former PASOK minister, a professor of constitutional law, a formidable speaker and a match for Karamanlis in many respects, he seemed to promise electoral recovery and victory next time. If the leadership contest had taken place immediately, he was certain to win. Papandreou, however, managed to delay it for almost two months, to his advantage. The delay was partly justified on technical grounds. According to the precedent set by Papandreou's unanimous election in 2004 (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2005</a></span>: 1025), not just party members but also ‘friends’ would be entitled to vote throughout the country. Only, this time, it was to be a true primary, requiring better organisation and agreed safeguards. To stem the polarisation threatening party unity, the likeable K. Skandalidis, former PASOK party secretary and minister, presented himself as a third contender.
         </p>
         
         <p>This campaign aroused far more interest than the previous one for the parliamentary election. As the weeks went by amid bitter recriminations, support for Papandreou increased at the expense of Venizelos. Apart from the latter's blunders, which confirmed an image of inordinate aggressiveness and arrogance, there were also deeper problems that favoured Papandreou. One was the problem of <i>charismatic succession</i>, which is often resolved by recourse to <i>familial</i> charisma, on the assumption that charisma is somehow inherited. PASOK originated as the following of a charismatic leader: Andreas G. Papandreou. As demonstrated in 2004 and again in 2007, party loyalists remain attached to these origins, allowing his son George to claim the party as a family heirloom. In contrast, Venizelos, a latecomer to PASOK, was rejected as an outsider that external forces (specific mass media) tried to impose on the party. Another problem had to do with party patronage and machine politics, and involved the vested interests of the PASOK cadres entrenched in occupational interest groups (see <span title=""><a href="#b1%20#b2" id="#b1 #b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 1993, 1997</a></span>). Venizelos was rash enough to denounce and challenge them, provoking a violent reaction that culminated in an unprecedented joint public statement by the five PASOK presidents of the peak confederations of labour (GSEE), civil servants (ADEDY), farmers (PASEGES and GESASE) and small business (GSEVEE).
         </p>
         
         <p>The PASOK leadership contest was held on 11 November. Some 738,000 persons were said to have voted (compared to 1 million in 2004). G. Papandreou won with 55.6 per cent, against 38.5 per cent for E. Venizelos and 5.8 per cent for K. Skandalidis. According to all opinion polls, many of those voting for Papandreou had no illusions about his ability to lead the party to electoral victory. Nonetheless, he interpreted the outcome as a personal triumph, and proceeded to dismiss all elected party bodies, replacing them with provisional bodies appointed by him until the next party congress (in early 2008). Venizelos supporters were generally excluded. Despite the many provocations, however, Venizelos was not prepared to split the party.</p>
         
         <p>The Government waited until the PASOK leadership contest was over before it began to unfold its plan for pension reform – a top priority. This reform provoked the universal opposition of the vested interests affected, which was sponsored and manipulated by the Opposition parties. Despite the Government's efforts, there was no constructive dialogue, either inside or outside parliament. Under attack, the responsible Minister of Employment V. Magginas was forced to resign on account of his private misconduct (violations of building regulations and employment of uninsured immigrants). On 17 December, he was replaced by a woman, F. Palli‐Petralia, a minister in the previous government. Also on 17 December, another scandal broke out, following the attempted suicide of Chr. Zachopoulos, secretary‐general of the Ministry of Culture, under blackmail for his affair with a female aide. The matter assumed major proportions only because of his close personal association with the Prime Minister.</p>

         <p>In the wake of the parliamentary election, a radical overhaul of the electoral system was briefly debated, with references to the German model from both ND and PASOK indicating a possible consensus of the two major parties. In the end, however, ND merely amended the existing system of ‘corrected’ PR, increasing the bonus to the strongest party from 40 to 50 seats. Constitutionally, this is to take effect only after the next election.</p>
