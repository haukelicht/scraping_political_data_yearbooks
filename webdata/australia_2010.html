                     Notes: Voting and counting is according to the single transferable vote form of proportional representation. Senators from states serve fixed six‐year terms (beginning on 1 July following election) and rotate, with half being elected every three years. The numbers shown are those in the <i>whole Senate</i> from 1 July 2011. The August 2010 half‐Senate election result was 18 for Liberal‐National, 15 for Labor, six for the Greens and one for the Democratic Labor Party. Note the lack of a plus or minus sign for ‘Other’. The reason is the lack of comparability for ‘Other’ as aggregated for previous elections. n.c. = no change. <sup>a</sup> The Senate consists of 12 senators from each state and two from each territory. <sup>b</sup> Senators are elected from states/territories which serve as multi‐member constituencies.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss1-title"> Federal leadership changes in 2010</h2>
         
         <p>The only important leadership change occurred at the very top. On 24 June, the caucus of the governing Labor Party accepted the resignation of Kevin Rudd as leader and installed Julia Gillard without a vote being taken. The resignation of Rudd, however, was forced by the fact that Gillard had issued a challenge to his leadership the previous day. Rudd set the caucus meeting for the morning of Thursday, 24 June, but discovered overnight that he enjoyed so little support it was not worth putting his name forward. A total of 112 caucus members attended and it is worth speculating what the numbers would have been if there had been a contest. My estimate is that 90 votes would have been cast for Gillard and 22 for Rudd. Rather than advertise the extent to which his support within the Labor Party had collapsed, Rudd decided to go without a contest. He immediately retired to the backbench and trivial changes were made to the cabinet pending the general election. So Rudd was Prime Minister from 3 December 2007 to 24 June 2010 and he was then a private member until the full Gillard cabinet was sworn in on Tuesday, 14 September. After that he was Foreign Minister – a post he still holds.</p>
         
         <p>On the afternoon of Saturday, 17 July, Gillard announced that the general election would be held on Saturday, 21 August. That meant there would be a five‐week campaign. The election would be for the House of Representatives and half the Senate (the normal type of Australian federal election) and not the double dissolution type of election I suggested as quite likely in this journal last year. The dissolution of the 42<sup>nd</sup> House of Representatives occurred at noon on Monday, 19 July.
         </p>
         
         <p>The result of the election was that the Labor Government lost its majority in the House of Representatives but it remained the largest single party. After some three weeks of negotiations with minor parties and independents, it was announced on Tuesday, 7 September, that the Gillard Government would continue as a minority government. Thus Julia Gillard became a so‐called ‘elected’ Prime Minister – as well as having the distinction of being Australia's first female Prime Minister. She is unmarried and childless, but has a male partner who lives with her and is presented with her at official functions. She is Australia's 27<sup>th</sup> Prime Minister.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is a technical point about Australian elections that overseas readers may not understand. Under our system of full preferential voting, a statement of first preference votes for the House of Representatives (such as in <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a> above) sometimes does not give a meaningful interpretation of the popular vote. A much better guide is the so‐called ‘two‐party preferred vote’ which is counted out officially for information purposes. At this election, the two‐party preferred vote was as follows: 6,216,445 votes for Labor (50.12 per cent) and 6,185,918 for Liberal‐National (49.88 per cent). At the 2007 election the percentages had been 52.70 for Labor and 47.30 for Liberal‐National. Consequently, the swing in 2010 was 2.58 per cent (away from Labor and towards Liberal‐National).

<p>At the end of the year, the Rudd Government was facing a dangerous opponent in the form of the new leader of the Liberal Party, Tony Abbott. In terms of preferred Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd is, nevertheless, ahead of Abbott by about two to one in the opinion polls of preference for the top job. There is much uncertainty about who will win the next general election, very likely to be held in August, September or October of 2010. It is true, however, that one needs to go back to December 1931 to find a case of a government defeated after only one term. On that basis, 2010 would see Rudd winning a second general election. On the other hand, 2010 is likely to see serious problems for Rudd in respect of asylum seekers and climate change policy. In these circumstances it would be unwise to make any predictions about the type of election and its result.</p>

            </blockquote>
            
         
         
         <p>Like almost every other commentator I underestimated the degree of personal hostility in the Labor Party caucus towards Kevin Rudd. (This is best described in the book <i>The Party Thieves</i> by well‐known journalist Barrie Cassidy.) Nevertheless, just as Rudd was facing serious problems on these policies so they became serious headaches for his successor, Julia Gillard. Since climate change is more important than asylum seekers I take it first. After discussing these two policies I consider another policy difficulty which beset the Rudd–Gillard Government.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Climate change</h2>
         
         <p>It was climate change policy which nearly brought an end to the Labor Government and nearly restored climate change denial as the de facto official policy of the Australian government. In my review last year (pp. 871–874) I mentioned that 2009 was dominated by this subject and, in particular, the parliamentary debate on Kevin Rudd's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme – the official title of the proposed emissions trading scheme. I also mentioned that on 3 December 2009 the legislation was rejected in the Senate by a margin of 42 votes to 34 (p. 873). I should have mentioned that the Greens joined the Liberals and Nationals in rejecting the legislation. As with several issues, the Labor position lay in the middle. The Liberals and Nationals were against the legislation because they are climate change deniers. The Greens were against the legislation because it did not go far enough. Due to the need for compensation for losers, the Greens tried to argue that the legislation was a kind of massive bounty to what they called ‘the big polluters’.</p>
         
         <p>Just what motivated this cynical gang‐up of left and right against the centre was debated by commentators. Some argued that the Senate merely rejected bad legislation. I argued that these three parties were cynically engineering the result to the 2010 election they wanted. Anyway, they succeeded. As the party in the middle, Labor bled votes and seats to the left and right (See <a href="#t1%20#t2" class="scrollableLink">Tables 1 and 2</a>). In the House of Representatives election there was a swing of 2.6 per cent from Labor to Liberal‐National in the two‐party preferred vote. For the elections in both houses the shares of the first‐preference vote for the Greens rose by 4 per cent. As I mentioned last year, however, Rudd did have another option. He could have called an early double dissolution election.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the morrow of the Senate rejection Rudd went to the Copenhagen climate change conference. He took with him sixty advisers, much to the derision of Abbott and his party. The conference turned out to be an absolute calamity for Rudd and his supporters. Consequently, when he returned to Australia he was in a bad mood. He and his advisers discussed the possibility of a double dissolution with polling day for the election set down as Saturday, 20 February 2010. A minority of his advisers favoured this option. They argued that any failure to do that would show Rudd to be without conviction. Rudd had repeatedly referred to climate change as ‘the great moral challenge of our time’. He could not back away from this fight, they claimed. However, the majority of his advisers thought otherwise. They thought Labor would lose such an election. Ultimately, Rudd did not proceed to the election. In the end he was not even a Prime Minister given the chance to name an election date. (My description about Rudd's advisers above was not known at the time. We pundits speculated about it all but we actually knew nothing then.)</p>
         
         <p>Late in April came an important leak. Lenore Taylor of <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> published a front page article titled ‘ETS off the agenda until late next term’. The article began: ‘The Rudd government has shelved its emissions trading scheme for at least three years in a bid to defuse Tony Abbott's “great big new tax” attack in this year's election campaign.’ The next sentence read: ‘The cabinet's strategic priorities and budget committee has removed the scheme from the four‐year forward estimates, a decision that saves $2.5 billion because household and industry compensation would have exceeded the revenue generated by the scheme in its early years.’
         </p>
         
         <p>During the election campaign Julia Gillard tried to finesse the climate change issue – but with limited success. The impression created was that Labor was not serious about climate change. That is an important reason for the rise in support for the Greens (see <a href="#t1%20#t2" class="scrollableLink">Tables 1 and 2</a>). In the end, however, Australia finished up with a government that does believe that there is global warming going on and does think something should be done about it. After the election was over and Labor needed to form a minority government, the deals it did with the Greens and independents included the imposition of some form of carbon tax, to be implemented no later than 2012.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Asylum seeker boats</h2>
         
         <p>Back in the days of the Howard Government there were developed the toughest policies to deter refugees arriving on Australia's shores by boat. These various policies, though vile from a humanitarian point of view, were, nevertheless, largely successful in stopping these arrivals of self‐selected refugees. Howard and his ministers would damn them as ‘queue jumpers’, ‘illegal immigrants’, etc., etc., thereby ensuring that such refugees would know they were not welcome. Under the Labor Government, however, some of the nastier Howard‐era features were repealed. The coalition predicted that the boats would start coming again.</p>
         
         <p>They were right. That they were right was fully exploited by Abbott and his party during 2010. His most common slogan throughout the year was ‘Stop the Boats!’ This slogan was uttered by him even more often than his other favourites: ‘Stop the Waste!’ and ‘Stop the great big new Taxes!’ (During the election campaign itself Abbott's television advertisements had him saying: ‘We will stop the boats, stop the great big new taxes, end the waste and pay back Labor's debt.’) That such a ridiculous assertion as ‘the Australian government has lost control of its borders’ (repeated many times by Abbott and his supporters) could gain such currency would surprise many foreign observers. Some more detail is needed to explain this paradox.</p>
         
         <p>For many years Australia has had an annual intake of 13,750 refugees. In an ideal world this would mean 13,750 people (established as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and invited to Australia by the Australian government) would come to Australia by the so‐called ‘front door’. However if, say, 3,000 come as boat people and are given permanent residency as refugees, then only 10,750 can come in by the ‘front door’. In 2010 there were a record 6,232 refugees coming by boat, leaving only 7,518 refugees coming in by the ‘front door’. The boat people refugees were 2,877 Afghans, 1,120 Iranians, 688 Iraqis, 537 Sri Lankans, 96 Burmese, 61 Kuwaitis, 43 Palestinians and 810 ‘others’. (Most of the ‘others’ could not be identified by country and so were listed as stateless.)</p>
         
         <p>I mentioned last year that forty boats arrived in 2009. The pace quickened in 2010. It was reported in late March as follows: ‘The 100<sup>th</sup> asylum boat to arrive since Kevin Rudd took office sailed directly to Christmas Island yesterday, arriving quietly at Flying Fish Cove before those aboard phoned authorities, requesting to be picked up.’ During the election campaign Gillard advanced a number of policy options designed to give the impression that Labor would be tougher in the future. These plans, however, did not satisfy Abbott or his party. His comment was: ‘You've got to be tough to protect our borders, and this government is not tough enough to do it.’
         </p>
         
         <p>In the end, however, the main deterrents to people arriving by boat seem to be the need for a lengthy stay in detention (while refugee claims are assessed) plus the number of boat people (unknown but thought to be about a hundred a year) who drown on their way to Australia. A particularly bad incident occurred on 15 December when a boat crashed into rocks on Christmas Island, killing 48. In January 2011 not a single boat arrived.</p>
         
         <p>This argument could well continue for a long time. Supporters of ‘Stop the Boats!’ argue that the punitive policy of nastiness towards boat people is really humanitarian policy because it saves lives. Others, including me, argue that discriminating against boat people is a policy contrary to international law. These refugees have a right under international law to seek asylum. People of my way of thinking ask the ‘Stop the Boats!’ crowd to provide some evidence that boat people make bad Australian citizens. They cannot because all the evidence is that boat people make very good citizens. The slogan ‘Stop the Boats!’ is not motivated by humanitarian concerns. It is simply explained. ‘Stop the Boats!’ is a vote‐winning slogan.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> Proposed Mineral Resources Rent Tax</h2>
         
         <p>Kevin Rudd had commissioned the Secretary to the Treasury, Ken Henry, to undertake a full review of Australia's taxation arrangements. The review was published on 2 May and provoked this comment from Ross Gittins of <i>The Sydney Morning Herald:</i></p>
         
         <p>
            
            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>If history is any guide, pretty much all the nasty changes proposed in the Henry tax review will be implemented. We shall end up with a congestion tax on cars, much higher tax on wine, land tax on the family home, higher tax on capital gains, cutbacks in negative gearing, a tax on bequests and annual increases in petrol tax.</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>
            
         
         
         <p>However, as Gittins and others pointed out, neither Prime Minister Kevin Rudd nor Treasurer Wayne Swan were interested in all that. The item in the Henry review which really excited their interest was for a tax on the mining industry, described at the time as the proposed Mineral Resources Super Profits Tax. It would have been worth AUS$12 billion a year and would have been used to boost the retirement savings of workers, lower business taxes and build infrastructure.</p>
         
         <p>The mining industry responded by spending AUS$22 million on a television campaign against the government. It had its effect and was one of the reasons why Rudd lost his position as Prime Minister. Gillard then moved in to fix the problem politically. The proposed tax was re‐named as the ‘Mineral Resources Rent Tax’ and changes to it meant that the government would get ‘only’ AUS$7 billion a year. The change was enough to enable Labor to win the election. The mining states, Queensland and Western Australia, voted solidly against Labor – but not enough to stop the party from winning. The election was won for Labor in the non‐mining states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss6-title"> The drought breaks</h2>
         
         <p>Australia's most distinguished poet, Dorothea Mackellar (1885–1968), famously described Australia as a ‘sunburnt country’ and as a land of ‘droughts and flooding rains’. For the most part Australia has been a land of droughts. In eastern Australia there has only ever been one lengthy wet period: the years 1945–1956, inclusive. No one expects that ever again. Since the infamous ‘Federation Drought’ (1895–1903), the pattern has been one of lengthy droughts (described as ‘major’ or ‘devastating’) followed by short wet periods. The years when John Howard was Prime Minister (1996–2007) were drought‐plagued, and the ‘devastating drought’ continued in 2008 and 2009. The drought broke in 2010. The actual month of the breaking depended on the declarations of the states, but it broke first in Queensland and last in Victoria. The <i>Australian</i> newspaper commemorated the ending of the drought in a special supplement on the weekend of l3–14 November.
         </p>
         
         <p>In terms of the weather Western Australia has always been a different country. Consequently the position for 2011 is very predictable. The south of Western Australia (including the Perth metropolitan area and virtually the entire agricultural region) will continue to suffer devastating drought. For the rest, Australia will be a land of flooding rains.</p>
         
      </div>
      
      <div class="article-section__content" id="ss7">
         
         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss7-title"> The Australian states</h2>
         
         <p>The nine Australian jurisdictions (the Commonwealth, six states and two territories) saw an essential stability in terms of government leadership in 2010. Seven jurisdictions saw no change at the top. Only the office of Prime Minister and Premier of Victoria changed. In the case of Victoria, the premiership changed on 2 December from John Brumby (Labor) to Ted Baillieu (Liberal). Brumby had been Premier since 30 July 2007 but had never won a general election, succeeding the three‐times election‐winning Steve Bracks in a smooth transition within the Labor Party. Baillieu, an architect by profession, was born in July 1953 and may best be described as a patrician, being very tall and from a famous Victorian family.</p>
         
         <p>There were three state general elections in 2010. In chronological order they were in South Australia and Tasmania (by chance on the same day: Saturday, 20 March) and in Victoria on 27 November. Victoria has a fixed term of Parliament, elections being fixed to be held on the last Saturday in November every fourth year. Consequently, recent elections have been on 30 November 2002, 25 November 2006 and 27 November 2010.</p>
         
         <p>The interesting psephological feature of the simultaneous South Australian and Tasmanian lower house elections lies in their very different electoral systems. The South Australian system is like that for the federal House of Representatives – preferential voting in single‐member constituencies. Tasmania's system is known in Australia as ‘Hare‐Clark’, but is essentially the same as the Irish system which is known in that country as ‘proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote’. Not surprisingly, the translation of votes into seats was very proportional in Tasmania and very disproportional in South Australia. In Tasmania the Labor and Liberal parties each won ten seats with the Greens five, in a total House of Assembly of 25. In South Australia Labor won 26 of the 47 seats, the Liberals 18 and three independents were elected, in a total House of Assembly of 47. South Australia's senior premier, Mike Rann (Labor), continued in office leading a majority government. This type of electoral system typically over‐represents Labor. Federally, the over‐representation is 10 per cent (see <a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink">Table 1</a> above), while in South Australia it is 18 per cent.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Tasmania the effect of the electoral system was that Labor lost the majority it had previously enjoyed. After three weeks of uncertainty, the existing Labor Premier, David Bartlett, was sworn in again but in a coalition government with the Greens whose leader, Nick McKimm, became Minister for Consumer Protection and Climate Change.</p>
         
         <p>The Victorian election on 27 November was conducted according to substantially the same electoral rules as those applying federally, save only that upper house members (unlike federal senators) do not rotate. The same four‐year term applies to both houses. The lower house is known as the ‘Legislative Assembly’ (88 members) and the upper house as the ‘Legislative Council’ (40 members).</p>
         
         <p>In November 2006, in the Legislative Assembly election, Labor won 55 seats, the Liberals 23 and the Nationals nine. One Independent was elected, in the seat of Gippsland East. In November 2010, Labor won 43 seats (a loss of 12), the Liberals 35 (a gain of 12) and the Nationals 10 (a gain of a single seat). The Independent member for Gippsland East was defeated by a National. All of the Labor, Liberal and National parties have enjoyed over‐representation in terms of their votes converting into seats. The Greens, other minor parties and independents (whose votes added up to 19 per cent of the total first‐preference vote) have seen all these votes convert into no seats at all.</p>
         
         <p>In November 2006, in the Legislative Council election, Labor won 19 seats, the Liberals 15, the Nationals two, the Greens three and another minor party won a single seat. In November 2010, Labor won 16 seats (a loss of three), the Liberals 18 (a gain of three), the Nationals three (a one‐seat gain) and the Greens also three (no change). The other minor party member lost his seat to a National.</p>
         
         <p>The coalition government of Liberals (led by Ted Baillieu) and Nationals (led by Peter Ryan) was sworn in on 2 December. On the same day, John Brumby announced that he would resign as Labor leader. The Labor caucus elected Daniel Andrews as the new leader. He now becomes the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss8-title"> Conclusion</h2>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, the Gillard Government was looking reasonably successful. Notwithstanding being in a minority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate it was, nevertheless, able to get parliamentary approval for all its legislation in the session which ran from late September to early December. Unfortunately for Gillard, however, significant doubts remain about her ability. She has plenty of people who wish her ill. These are mainly supporters of the Liberal and National parties, but also include some Labor supporters still resenting the way in which she replaced Kevin Rudd.</p>
         
         <p>This latter type of ill‐wisher is best illustrated by well‐known media commentator, Phillip Adams, who had resigned his life‐long Labor membership in protest when the leadership change occurred. Writing in <i>The Weekend Australian</i> early in February 2011 he asserted: ‘The failure of Gillard truly to replace Rudd is agonisingly obvious. Her tenure in the job is tenuous. Senior members of her Cabinet see her as a flop. They are talking about dumping her. Sooner rather than later.’ Later in the article Adams wrote: ‘Having lost so much talent in the Gillard‐led election disaster, the pickings are not merely slim but skeletal. Nonetheless, Gillard will go down in history as . . . a footnote? A foolish mistake. Certainly she'll go down in history. Straight down.’ What am I to say about that line of thinking?
         </p>
         
         <p>My take is to deny absolutely the view that the election result was a disaster for Labor. The election was very close but Labor won and is, therefore, still in government. If Rudd had been leader, Labor would have lost. I cannot prove that assessment but I have strong support for this view in the book <i>The Party Thieves</i> by Barrie Cassidy, to which I referred above.
         </p>
         
         <p>Back in August 2008 I had an article published in <i>The Weekend Australian</i> in which I ranked the then 26 holders of the office of Australian Prime Minister in order of greatness. I had four ‘greats’ (Robert Menzies, John Curtin, Alfred Deakin and Andrew Fisher), nine ‘high average’, nine ‘low average’ and four ‘failures’. I placed Rudd among the nine cases of ‘low average’– admittedly high up in that category. When Gillard loses office (perhaps in October 2013 but perhaps later than that) I shall re‐write that article. I expect that I shall place her in the ‘high average’ category, perhaps at number 11 out of 27. In other words, I think she will rank in the top half. Time will tell!
