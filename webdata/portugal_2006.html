         <p>Throughout 2007, the Socrates Government continued on the path of reform upon which it had set out at the beginning of its term. At the core of all the reforms was an ambitious programme to modernise public administration and the public services – particularly the education sector. The Government's agenda in relation to the modernisation of public administration has two main objectives. On the one hand, it wants to achieve a slim public administration with fewer civil servants and bureaucratic structures. On the other, it wants to simplify and speed up administrative processes in which citizens may have to engage. In this sense, the Government completed about 280 of the 333 measures of the Simplex programme, which intends to simplify administrative acts. In 2007, the Government was in the process of creating a network of citizen's one‐stop shops across the country, which will concentrate all relevant administrative services in one place. Among the services to be offered were divorce, inheritance, foundation of new enterprises and all kinds of certificates by way of an ambitious programme to conduct administrative acts online (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">GSEMA 2007</a></span>). All of these measures are part of an overall European effort to simplify administrative processes, but it gains special importance in the Portuguese case because of the government deficit that was still at 3 per cent of GDP at the end of 2007.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Portuguese economy continued to be the main problem for the Government. At the end of the year, the unemployment rate was still at 7.9 per cent, of which half was unemployed for more than a year. The cuts and below‐inflation adjustment of salaries of 2.1 per cent among civil servants led to a general strike in July and a major demonstration organised by the trade union confederations on 30 November 2007. However, the general strike was only organised by the communist General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP‐In) and without the support of the socialist‐social‐democratic General Confederation of Workers (UGT). In economic terms, small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises, of which there are perhaps too many inefficient examples in Portugal, were the ones suffering most under the bad economic conditions.</p>
         
         <p>Although he introduced measures targeted to reduce public employment, Prime Minister Socrates continued to enjoy high levels of approval by the population, even if they were lower than at the beginning of his term. The Government continued to work with the main opposition party towards a reform of the Assembly of the Republic in order to gain control over the high level of absenteeism and increase the rights of scrutiny of parliament over the government, particularly at committee level. The new standing order was approved before the Summer and came into force in September 2007. Prime Minister Socrates also had to deal with accusations that during his time as a student of civil engineering at the private University Moderna in the northern city of Covilhã he was seldom seen in classes and his degree was suspect. In the end, it was discovered that the university had misplaced his files, so it was therefore difficult to come to a conclusive answer.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Small reshuffle of the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>On 17 May 2007, Minister of Interior Antonio Costa, a close ally of Prime Minister José Socrates, was replaced by Constitutional Court judge, Rui Carlos Pereira. Since judges of the Constitutional Court have to commit themselves to neutrality when it comes to party politics, this appointment was heavily criticised by the opposition parties. However, Rui Carlos Pereira has considerable executive experience: he was a junior minister in the second Guterres Government between 2000 and 2002.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> The abortion referendum</h2>
         
         <p>In January and February, the referendum on the voluntary termination of pregnancy was the major issue in political terms. Yearly, an average of 6,000 women go to the Spanish border cities of Merida, Cáceres and Badajoz to obtain an abortion in a private clinic. The main reason is that the Portuguese law on abortion is one of the most conservative of the European Union (EU). The referendum on 11 February 2007 intended to de‐criminalise any abortion up to ten weeks, as long as the patient has spoken to the doctor in the National Health Service and was informed about possible physical and psychological consequences. In the event of a ‘yes’ vote, the Government intended to pay for such treatment in private clinics, should the public hospitals not be able to deliver. The law also contemplated several exceptions in which abortion could take place beyond ten weeks. At the same time, the Government would strengthen the mechanisms of monitoring and implementing the law. The pro‐choice camp was supported by the three parliamentary left‐wing parties – BE, Communists (PCP) and Socialists (PS) – while the right‐wing parties tended to support the pro‐life camp. However, there was general discontent in the PSD and CDS‐PS due to the lack of engagement in supporting the ‘no’‐camp. Although PSD leader Marques Mendes was personally against liberalisation of the abortion law, he described it as his personal choice and argued that members of the party should follow their conscience. There were 15 citizens' groups campaigning in the ‘no’ camp and five in the ‘yes’ camp. The actual campaign was between 30 January and 9 February 2007, although the majority of citizens' groups started their campaigns much earlier (see <i>Expresso</i>, 13 January 2007, p. 10; 20 January 2007, pp. 2–4; 27 January 2007, pp. 10–11). The result was an overwhelming victory for the ‘yes’ camp, quite different from the ‘no’ result of the 1998 referendum. However, the result is not binding on the Government because it did not achieve the required 50 per cent participation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Prime Minister José Socrates was content with the result, but announced that he would be working with the opposition parties towards a consensus in order to avoid a potential veto by the president or his sending an eventual law to the Constitutional Court (<i>Expresso</i>, 17 Feburary 2007, pp. 10–11). In spite of the further improvement of the law on abortion, Portugal still remains one of the most conservative countries on this question compared to, for example, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> The regional elections in Madeira and the local by‐elections in Lisbon</h2>
         
         <p>The president of the autonomous regional government of Madeira, the Social Democrat Alberto João Jardim, resigned in March 2007 due to the new Law of Regional Financing introduced by the central government. The new law sets limits to the deficit spending of the regional budget in a quest to control the budget deficit of the whole country. Regional President Alberto João Jardim had been in power since 1976, and as a result the island is allegedly dominated by a web of clientelism, patronage and corruption. The real amount of the regional budget deficit is not known, but it is calculated to be €2 billion – twice as much as the annual budget. In spite of calls for a thorough and transparent management of the regional budget, charismatic leader Alberto João Jardim used populist language against Lisbon.</p>
         
         <p>On 6 May 2007, the PSD was able to win a substantial victory against the PS. Jacinto Serrão, PS leader in Madeira, lost considerable support compared to the previous election. The PSD under Alberto João Jardim was able to expand its absolute majority from 53.7 to 64.24 per cent and win 33 seats out of 47. The PS lost 12 per cent by achieving only 15.42 per cent and seven seats. The CDS‐PP was able to achieve 5.35 per cent and hold on to its two seats. The Communists scored almost the same result as in 2004 with 5.44 per cent and two seats, while the Bloc of the Left dropped from 3.7 to 2.98 per cent and one seat. A big surprise was the entry of two new political parties into the regional assembly. The ecological Movement Party of the Earth (<i>Movimento Partido da Terra</i>, MPT) got 2.26 per cent and one seat, and the New Democracy Party of former CDS‐PP leader Manuel Monteiro was also able to get representation with 2.08 per cent and one seat.
         </p>
         
         <p>After the collapse of the PSD‐led government under Mayor Carmona Rodrigues in April, by‐elections were called to elect a new government in Lisbon. The state of finances of the capital were very bad and many corruption scandals related to the lack of competition processes for major municipal projects were uncovered by the Public Prosecutor (<i>Expresso</i>, 9 June 2007, p. 6; 16 June 2007, p. 10; 30 June 2007, p. 5, 14 July 2007, pp. 2–3, 28 July 2007, p. 4). The PS leadership decided to nominate Minister of the Interior Antonio Costa as its candidate for mayor of Lisbon. The PSD was represented by Fernando Negrão. Both main parties had to deal with independents who were former members of the respective parties. Former socialist MP Helena Roseta led a list called ‘Citizens for Lisbon’, while former PSD mayor Carmona Rodrigues also decided to take part in the elections.
         </p>
         
         <p>The elections took place on 15 July 2007. Although the PS under the leadership of Antonio Costa won the elections with 29.49 per cent and got six councillors, this was not enough to form a stable government. The PSD list obtained 15.8 per cent and three seats, while the former mayor and his list ‘Lisbon with Carmona’ was able to surpass the PSD vote with 16.63 per cent and three seats. Helena Roseta and her ‘Citizens for Lisbon’ got 10.27 per cent and two seats and the Communists 9.44 per cent and two seats, while the Block of the Left got 6.83 per cent and one seat (CNE 2007). Socialist mayor Antonio Costa formed a minority coalition government with the Block of the Left. Participation was only 36.7 per cent (<i>Expresso</i>, 4 August 2007, p. 5).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> The Portuguese presidency of the European Union</h2>
         
         <p>After Germany, it was Portugal's turn to take over the rotating presidency of the EU in the second half of 2007. The agenda was already set out by the German presidency, which had revived the prospects of a reform of the Constitutional Treaty, after a period of reflection after the two ‘no’ decisions in the French and Dutch referendums in May and June 2005. Throughout the second half of 2007, the Portuguese presidency was able to renegotiate and water‐down the Constitutional Treaty to what then became known as the ‘Lisbon Treaty’. This can be regarded as big success for Portuguese diplomacy, in spite of the continuing resistance of vast groups of citizens in Portugal and across Europe against the Constitution or any version of it. Due to its watered‐down nature, most countries could claim to be able to ratify it simply in parliament. Probably among the most controversial issue of the presidency was the invitation of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe to the EU–Africa summit in Lisbon, which ended up with strong criticisms of his running of his country by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was part of the EU Presidency troika.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss6"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss6-title"> The political parties</h2>
         
         <p>The PSD leader Marques Mendes had to deal with growing opposition inside the party. In June he tried desperately to reshuffle his team in order to regain momentum, but the bad results in the municipal elections in Lisbon contributed to the strengthening of the opposition inside the party. His main opponent became the mayor of the northern town of Vila Nova de Gaia, Luis Felipe Menezes. On 21 July, the party decided to call for primaries in order to find out who the members of the PSD wanted as leader. From the very beginning there were major issues about which members had the right to vote. Although the PSD allegedly has 145,568 members, only about 63,031 have the right to vote because they have paid all the membership fees. Both Marques Mendes and Luis Felipe Menezes denounced irregularities in the process. In the end, Luis Felipe Menezes won the primaries (<i>Expresso</i>, 29 September 2007, pp. 2–3; 6 October 2007, pp. 2–4). The thirtieth party conference took place soon after the primaries on 12–14 October in Torres Vedras. It was used to endorse the team of new leader Menezes – particularly his number two: former Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes. However, the party continued to be plagued by internal strife, which undermined the new leadership. The membership issue has contributed to a deterioration of the image of the party (<i>Expresso</i>, 29 September 2007, pp. 2–3; 6 October 2007, pp. 2–4, 20 October 2007, pp. 10–11).
         </p>
         
         <p>In the CDS‐PP, leader Ribeiro e Castro was replaced by the charismatic former Defence Minister Paulo Portas, who won the party primaries on 21 April 2007 with an overwhelming 74.6 per cent of the vote. He started immediately as leader of the party and appointed a new team, which was endorsed by the party conference on 18–20 May 2007. Portas advocated a change in the ideology of the party towards liberalism and used the examples of Nicolas Sarkozy's Union of the People's Majority and David Cameron's Conservatives. In spite of his overwhelming victory, the party remained extremely divided. Portas is a divisive leader and several representatives of the Christian‐democratic roots of the party like Ribeiro e Castro, Manuel Queiró and Daniel Campelo expressed their concerns about this change of ideological direction throughout the year (<i>Expresso</i>, 28 April 2007, p. 5; 5 May 2007, p. 5).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss7"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss7-title"> High level of popularity for Prime Minister José Socrates despite austere reform programme</h2>
         
         <p>According to surveys conducted by the weekly newspaper <i>Expresso</i> in May 2007, Prime Minister Socrates still had a positive rating of over 30 per cent, while his government was quite unpopular with a negative balance of 9.7 per cent. At the end of the year, his positive rating continued to be high at 29 per cent. In spite of leadership changes in the other political parties during the year, he continued to be the most popular politician. Second place was the new leader of the PSD, Felipe Menezes, who had a positive balance of 5.9 per cent. Paulo Portas, the new leader of the CDS‐PP, had only a positive balance of 0.9 per cent and Francisco Louçã, leader of the Left Block (BE), only 0.2 per cent. Communist leader Jerónimo da Sousa ended up the year with a negative balance. The Government ended the year with a negative balance of 0.7 per cent, which was, however, better than in the first half of the year. Moreover, the Socialist Party was able to maintain a considerable lead over the other parties, polling over 42 per cent over the year. In contrast, the main opposition party ended the year with 32.1 per cent. One of the reasons for the continuing success of Prime Minister Socrates was the fact that the main opposition party was not able to make any impact (<i>Expresso</i>, 9 June 2007, p. 12; 8 December 2007, p. 10; 26 May 2007, p. 12).
