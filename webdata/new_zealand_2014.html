         <p>Election years are always tumultuous, but 2014 was especially rocky in New Zealand politics. Scandals and controversies dominated the whole year, testing a popular government at the end of its second term. Despite all that was thrown at the government, it emerged victorious from the general election, albeit with a tarnished reputation.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Parliamentary election, September 2014</h3>
            
            <p>The first strange foray into the election campaign occurred in January when Internet mogul Kim Dotcom announced that he was launching an Internet Party to contest the election. He committed about NZ$4.5 million to the new party, which continued to astonish throughout the year. Promoting Internet freedom and privacy, the party surprised the public by going into an electoral alliance with the left‐wing Mana Party for the election. Dotcom, himself, could not stand for parliament (he is a German national) and instead the first leader was announced on 29 May as former cabinet minister Laila Harre.</p>
            
            <p>The party received significant media coverage – well out of proportion to its actual level of public support – culminating in Dotcom's ‘moment of truth’ public meeting five days before the election. At this large meeting, streamed on the Internet, American journalist Glenn Greenwald, together with fugitives Edward Snowden and Julian Assange (via live links), made allegations about state surveillance of the New Zealand public. Dotcom was also supposed to speak, promising evidence that would ruin Prime Minister John Key, but never did. The meeting was polarising. The Prime Minister dismissed the allegations and convinced much of the public that the attacks were baseless and unfair. Therefore, rather than damaging the government, the ‘moment of truth’ appeared to play some role in boosting National's support in the final week of the campaign, and discrediting the Internet‐Mana Party.</p>
            
            <p>There were many other scandals. The most significant was contained in a book called <i>Dirty Politics: How Attack Politics is Poisoning New Zealand's Political Environment</i>. Written by investigative journalist Nicky Hager, the book was primarily concerned with how the government had allegedly used a blogger, Cameron Slater, to carry out its negative attacks on opponents. The book was based on communications that had been hacked from the blogger's computer. When the book was published on 13 August – just five weeks from the election – it caused a storm, and much of the election debate was concerned with its various allegations, and with the questions it raised about the integrity of the Prime Minister, who was indirectly implicated.

            <p>Opposition parties complained that the focus on scandals left them out of the picture. However, even the main opposition party, Labour, was not immune to some of the stranger elements of the campaign. For example, its leader, David Cunliffe, gained possibly his greatest publicity when he attended a conference concerned with domestic violence and pronounced that he was ‘sorry for being a man’.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, these controversies seemed to produce something of a scandal fatigue for most New Zealanders. In such circumstances, voters revert to what they know and feel comfortable with – and in 2014 that was either voting for National, or not voting at all.</p>
            
            <p>National contrasted the focus on scandal with its own focus on policy. And in this, its focus was strongly on the economy. It argued that the government had managed the country through the global financial crisis and that prosperity was being achieved. National's approach was rewarded with a remarkable election victory. Despite the significant controversy endured during the campaign, it managed to hold onto its previous high vote, slipping only slightly to 47 per cent. This was nearly twice that of the second largest party, Labour, who achieved just 25 per cent. For Labour, this was its worst result since 1922.</p>
            
            <p>There were few upsets in what was essentially a ‘no change’ election. The third largest party, the Greens, slipped slightly, but held onto its 14 seats. The New Zealand First Party, led by Winston Peters, was the only parliamentary party to increase its vote, and its seats increased from eight to 11. The Maori Party lost one seat, falling to two. And the parties of United Future and Act held onto their single constituency seats (albeit with declining support). Colin Craig's Conservative Party failed to reach the 5 per cent electoral threshold, getting just under 4 percent. Yet the main upset was that the Mana Party – in alliance with the Internet Party – not only failed to increase its presence in parliament, but actually lost its leader's seat, with Hone Harawira being beaten in his Maori constituency by the Labour candidate.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Key II cabinet, ending 8 October 2014</h3>
            
            <p>Prior to the general election, there were few changes in the National cabinet. A minor reshuffle occurred at the start of the year, with Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Local Government Chris Tremain resigning on account of his decision to retire at the upcoming general election. His portfolios were reassigned, and his place in cabinet was given to Michael Woodhouse, who was already the Minister of Immigration and Minister of Police, but had held these portfolios as a minister outside of cabinet.</p>
            
            <p>A more significant departure occurred on 30 August – just three weeks out from the general election – when Judith Collins, the Minister of Justice, resigned in relation to the ‘dirty politics’ controversy. Collins’ ministerial position had been tenuous from the moment the book came out, but her position became untenable once the Prime Minister became aware of more damaging evidence about her alleged role in relationship to her ministerial work.</p>

            <p>After the election, ‘confidence and supply’ agreements were negotiated with the three minor parties of United Future, Act Party and the Maori Party, which allowed National to continue in office as a minority government for a third term. As with the previous terms, this agreement provided the minor parties with executive positions outside of cabinet. United Future leader Peter Dunne was given the ministerial portfolio of Internal Affairs (which he had held before the election), Maori Party leader Te Ururoa Flavell became the new Minister for Maori Development, and new Act leader and first‐term MP, David Seymour, was made a parliamentary under‐secretary.</p>

         <p>There were two high‐profile departures from parliament prior to the general election. First, Labour list MP Shane Jones made a shock announcement on 22 April that he would be leaving in May. It was especially controversial because Jones had accepted the newly created role of ‘Pacific Economic Ambassador’ working for the government. The second controversial departure was the leader and sole MP of the Act Party, John Banks, who left after being found guilty of filing a false electoral return for an earlier local government mayoral campaign. Banks resigned on 13 June 2014, and because this was within six months of the upcoming general election, no by‐election was deemed necessary.</p>
         
         <p>The general election brought some demographic changes for parliament, and in terms of ethnicity, there was greater diversity. The number of MPs who self‐identify as being descended from Maori (the indigenous occupants of New Zealand) increased from 22 to 25 – about 21 per cent of the parliament. Proportionately this was greater than the adult population of Maori in New Zealand (18 per cent). The other ethnic minority to improve its representation was Pacific MPs – increasing from six to eight. At about 7 per cent of the parliament, this proportion is similar to wider society. In contrast, parliament continued to be relatively unrepresentative of Asians. The new parliament contained five MPs that identify as Asian, which is 4 per cent of the parliament, compared to 11 per cent of the wider population.</p>
         
         <p>The number of women in parliament has remained stable: the 39 female MPs comprised 31 per cent of the parliament.</p>
         
         <p>The parliamentary library carried out research on the changing occupational backgrounds of MPs, and found that the new parliament was more ‘professional’ than previous ones. Those MPs that identify as being a ‘businessperson’ before entering parliament were now the largest group: ‘28 MPs (23 per cent of all MPs) listed their previous occupation’ as such (Wilson <span><a href="#epdy12101-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12101-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2015</a></span>). On top of this, a ‘further 20 MPs (17 per cent of the parliament) listed their previous occupation as a “manager or administrator”, confirming a recent trend for increasing numbers of these professionals to enter parliament’. In contrast, the same study found that ‘[t]wo percent of MPs in 2014 were previously union workers’ – a new low.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12101-sec-0080-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>In response to considerable controversy and challenges about issues of state surveillance, the government reorganised the lines of political responsibility for its two spy agencies. Essentially, the ministerial responsibility for these agencies was split into two. Traditionally, the Prime Minister held sole responsibility for the agencies, but henceforth a new ministerial portfolio, the Minister of National Security and Intelligence, would be held by the Prime Minister, while the Attorney General would be the Minister Responsible for the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) and Minister in Charge of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS).</p>
         
         <p>Political parties saw some internal changes in 2014. Labour experienced a leadership change, with David Cunliffe stepping down as leader a week after the general election loss. Initially he stepped down with the stated intention of hoping to be re‐elected in a party contest, but later decided to withdraw his nomination. The contest was then between four candidates: Grant Robertson, Andrew Little, David Parker and Nanaia Mahuta. The contest was held using Labour's relatively new system which gave a 40 per cent of the vote to MPs, 40 per cent to party members and 20 per cent to trade union affiliates. Andrew Little was the winner, only marginally ahead of Grant Robertson, and was helped by his strong support from unions.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12101-sec-0090-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Scandals over donations to political parties were a mainstay of the year: Maurice Williamson resigned as a minister in relation to donations received from someone he had advocated for in police proceedings; John Banks was convicted of electoral fraud (later overturned); Minister of Justice Judith Collins faced endless allegations about her involvement with a company that had connections to herself and her party; and Labour Party leader David Cunliffe was embarrassed by revelations of a secret trust he had used when campaigning to become leader. And, of course, the aspiring politicians Kim Dotcom and Colin Craig poured extraordinary amounts of money into their own small parties.</p>
         
         <p>Arguably, however, it was issues of economics and the economy that actually concerned voters most during the year. There were plenty of signs that social and other non‐economic issues did not resonate with voters. Previously such issues had been important, but ever since the onset of the global financial crisis, the electoral pendulum has been swinging back towards traditional concerns. The public's orientation towards economics didn't necessarily make politics more conservative. In fact, surveys showed that the major concerns of voters related to the rising cost of living, house prices and the low minimum wage. What is more, according to some surveys the single biggest concern for voters was economic inequality – traditionally a key concern of the left. The other major economic‐related issue concerned the rising cost of housing. The government answered this with many minor policy changes – especially promising to free up more land for development and introducing a scheme providing small grants to help purchase homes. But the issue continued to be one on which the government remained vulnerable.</p>
