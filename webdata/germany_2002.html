         <p>German politics was dominated by two major themes throughout the year 2003: the German position towards the war in Iraq and attempts to implement neo‐liberal reforms in order to solve Germany's growing economic crisis. While the former tended to work in favour of the red‐green coalition government, the latter plunged the Social Democratic Party (SPD) into one of the worst crises of its 140 year‐long history. As in 1998, the Government had a troubled start after its surprising re‐election in late summer of 2002, which led some observers to believe that the coalition had entered its second term so unprepared because few had believed in the chances for re‐election (see entry on Germany in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>). When the disastrous economic figures became known in autumn 2002, the government reacted with considerable confusion including an unpopular mix of some neo‐liberal reforms and increased taxes and social security contributions. The immediate result was a massive downturn of the SPD in the polls and considerable internal dissent, while its Green coalition partner remained unaffected. The poor opinion poll ratings materialized in two disastrous Land election defeats on 2 February 2003. The SPD lost its absolute majority and some 14 percentage points in Chancellor Schröder's Land of Lower Saxony, while their Hesse comrades lost about 10 percentage points, allowing the Christian Democrats to win an absolute majority in the Land legislature.<a href="#t1%20#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>Shortly after this election day, a dramatic rise in unemployment was announced (4.6 million, 11.1 per cent) and it became increasingly obvious that Germany would again fail to meet the 3 per cent deficit requirement of the stability and growth pact of the euro zone. Chancellor Schröder reacted by announcing that his Government would now pursue an unequivocally neo‐liberal course in a major <i>Bundestag</i> speech on 14 March. After months of meandering between some welfare cuts and elements of Keynesianism, Schröder unilaterally announced a liberalization of the labour market and far‐reaching welfare cuts including substantial reductions in support for long‐term unemployed and general cuts in health provision. Schröder's presidential style of lonely decisions was met with vociferous dissent from all parts of his governing Social Democratic Party and the trade union movement. His so‐called ‘agenda 2010’ was heavily criticized for its alleged one‐sidedness that left high‐income earners and business largely unscathed. The strong mobilization of intra‐party dissent forced the SPD leadership to schedule a special party conference for 1 June, which, after much controversial discussion and some smoothening of the most drastic cuts, approved the Government's programme with a 90 per cent majority. Two weeks later, a Green special party conference followed suit, but again the rank‐and‐file found it hard fully to support leadership's new strategy and pressed for some elements of redistributive policies to be pursued.
         </p>
         
         <p>The government's u‐turn met a somewhat unprepared opposition and revealed rifts within the Christian Democratic parties as to how far welfare reforms should go down the neo‐liberal route. As a first step, CDU/CSU agreed to cooperate with the Government over health reform and used the peak‐level negotiations to inflict further pain on the coalition's traditional left supporters. In an attempt to reduce labour costs and, hopefully, to stimulate the labour market, the compromise included the introduction of a fee for consulting a doctor, higher fees for medication, and the requirement to insure dental care and sick insurance privately. Immediately after the compromise had been reached in July, Green Foreign Secretary Fischer argued in favour of a more fundamental reform through the introduction of a ‘citizens’ insurance’ scheme that would include all forms of income in a national health insurance, thereby extending obligatory health insurance levies to civil servants, the self‐employed and income from capital. Almost simultaneously, a CDU commission led by former federal President Roman Herzog suggested the introduction of a flat‐rate health insurance, a model that was heavily criticized within the CDU and particularly by its Christian Social sister party for its lack of a redistributive element. In the autumn, the CDU pushed further and approved a radical tax reform that would abolish most tax exemptions in exchange for a three‐level tax tariff and overall lower income taxes.</p>
         
         <p>Since the politics of the Federal Republic is heavily geared towards co‐decision of the <i>Bundesrat</i>, where the opposition parties controlled the majority of the votes, much of the second half of 2003 was dominated by ongoing negotiations between Government and opposition. In a nutshell, CDU, CSU and FDP attempted to push the Government further on its neo‐liberal course, knowing that this would make dissenting votes in the Government's camp, particularly within the SPD, more likely. Schröder responded with repeated threats to resign and succeeded, by and large, in keeping his troops to the colours. In mid‐December, a marathon session of the arbitration committee of <i>Bundesrat und Bundestag</i> (<i>Vermittlungsausschuss</i>) finally agreed on a deal including a modest reduction of income tax, a further liberalization of the labour market and harsher conditions for the long‐term unemployed.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Social Democrats were heavily penalized for this course and continued to decline at the polls throughout the year. After the Government had to announce that pensioners would suffer income losses, the SPD hit an all‐time low and continued to be rated below 30 per cent of the popular vote. The Greens, on the other hand, showed remarkable strength in the polls, which might be explained by the fact that the coalition's reforms hit the SPD's core constituency hardest. The only exception to the continuing Social Democratic gloom was the Bremen <i>Land</i> election of May, when the SPD could defend its share of the vote while the CDU lost 7 per cent and the Greens won almost 4 per cent. This contrasted starkly with the Bavarian <i>Land</i> elections of 21 September, where the governing CSU of former Chancellor‐candidate Edmund Stoiber won a two‐thirds majority for the first time in German electoral history.

         <p>Clearly, the SPD did not benefit significantly from Chancellor Schröder's widely popular rejection of the war in Iraq, which gained additional prominence because Germany happened to be a temporary Security Council member during the decisive period leading up to the invasion of Iraq. As in the 2002 national election campaign, Schröder's unequivocal rejection of military action seemed to be motivated at least partially by his desire to score points with his domestic audience during the <i>Land</i> election campaigns of Hesse and Lower Saxony and threatened to isolate Germany internationally. In the end, however, the United States’ uncompromising approach led several other major players, including France and Russia, to side with Germany. Against the public mood and considerable scepticism within her own party, CDU leader Angela Merkel supported the policy of the United States.

         <p>Other major events in 2003 included a bitter conflict over the leadership of the metalworkers union, which ended with a victory of hardliner Jürgen Peters over the more moderate Berthold Huber. Disgraced former Vice‐Chancellor and FDP deputy chair Jürgen Möllemann hit the headlines a final time when he killed himself in early June by manipulating his own parachute so that the reserve could not open after he had disposed of the main parachute in mid‐air. In September, President Johannes Rau announced that he would not seek re‐election in 2004, a move that was clearly inspired by the fact that CDU/CSU and FDP would control the majority of the vote in the federal assembly (<i>Bundesversammlung</i>) that elects the President. This is a special assembly comprising the <i>Bundestag</i> and an equal number of delegates from the <i>Land</i> legislatures who are elected by proportional representation. In November, the first step into a non‐nuclear future was taken when the first nuclear power station was switched off. In December, the Hamburg <i>Land</i> government finally collapsed after the coalition of CDU, FDP and the right‐wing populist Schill Party had limped along for several months. Already in August, Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust had sacked party founder Ronald Schill from his cabinet after Schill had attempted to blackmail him over an alleged homosexual affair with another cabinet member – a clear advance in Germany's aspiration to reach Anglo‐American levels of public scandals.
