         <p>Minister of State Jim Sutton left the cabinet and Parliament in July and was not replaced as the position was transitional prior to his retirement from politics. Otherwise, except for a slight change in the title of Clayton Cosgrove's Building portfolio, the major event in the Cabinet was David Parker's resignation in March and re‐appointment in May. Parker resigned after allegations in <i>Investigate</i> magazine that he had behaved improperly in business activities some years earlier. After an official investigation, Parker was found to have done nothing wrong and was thus reinstated, although he was not re‐assigned the portfolio of Attorney‐General.

         <p>As always, economic issues remained an important background to New Zealand politics in 2006. Unemployment at year's end was only 3.7 per cent, little changed from the year's beginning, and one of the best performances in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Annual calendar year growth was less inspiring at 1.5 per cent. The New Zealand dollar ended the year strongly, at US$0.69, much as it had begun, although its value temporarily dipped by a few cents over the middle of the year to a level more favourable to the country's export sector. Inflation held at 2.6 per cent, but at the cost of some of the highest interest rates in the OECD, based on an official cash rate of 7.25 per cent. That held constant throughout the year, but the housing market continued to remain buoyant. Company tax cuts continued to be advocated in business circles, with the Government conceding there might be some movement on the issue in the unspecified future, coupled with a spill‐over into personal rates.</p>
         
         <p>The most sound and fury in New Zealand politics in 2006 had little to do with the economy. It centred on a series of alleged scandals, some real and some imaginary, all generating much publicity. A fresh flurry of claims emerged about Social Development Minister's David Benson‐Pope's alleged mistreatment of children as a teacher some years before. Exaggerated Opposition charges in the House that he had acted like a ‘pervert’ tipped the balance of public sympathy somewhat towards Benson‐Pope, and the matter subsided.</p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, allegations made just before the 2005 election about the conduct of another Labour MP, Taito Philip Field, intensified in 2006. Field was said to have breached provisions in the Cabinet manual by asking a ministerial colleague to grant a work permit to a Thai briefly resident in New Zealand. The person in question provided manual labour for work on Field's house in Samoa for little payment on the understanding he would be able to return to live in New Zealand as a result of Field's support. An Inquiry by a Queen's Counsel was established, but did not report until July. It found no misconduct, but further allegations led to a police inquiry and Field was given leave from Parliament, with his vote remaining in the hands of his party whips. The Government and its support parties having only 61 seats in the 121‐seat house, the Labour Party was unwilling to take further action, arguing that Field was innocent until proven guilty of breaching the law. Field was also one of three MPs of Pacific Island origin and Pacific Islanders are among of Labour's strongest supporters, but remain under‐represented in the House. Opposition parties continued to raise the issue, and used a trickle of further allegations about aspects of Field's conduct to embarrass the Government and Prime Minister.</p>
         
         <p>The Exclusive Brethren continued to play an unusual role in politics. A private investigator reported that members of the Church had employed him to inquire into the private lives of members of the Labour‐led Government and their families. Allegations by the morally conservative <i>Investigate</i> magazine about Cabinet Minister David Parker were found to be without merit, but only after Parker had resigned from the cabinet for two months, and could then be re‐appointed. <i>Investigate</i> also ran a story about the Prime Minister Helen Clark's husband, Peter Davis, questioning his sexual orientation and inviting readers to help them ‘investigate’ the matter further. Most observers accepted that the claim was false, given the absence of any evidence to support it, the Prime Minister's indignant rebuttal and the obvious bemusement of Davis himself, but the matter received much prurient attention. Those opposed to the Government from the ‘moral right’ were seeking to use such allegations to brand the Government corrupt, immoral, and a focus of ‘sleaze’. The opposition National Party was more than willing to reinforce the theme. The main goal was to diminish the reputation of the Prime Minister, whose popularity remains one of the Government's key assets. Clark was sufficiently irked by the allegations about her colleagues and her husband and the ways in which they were expressed to describe the leader of the Opposition, Don Brash, as ‘cancerous’. Leading politicians were descending into name‐calling that did not reflect well on any of them. The level of rancour between the political leaderships of the two major parties had grown to an extent not seen since the early 1980s.
         </p>
         
         <p>Emphasis in the discourse on the personal behaviour and reputations of persons in public life soon rebounded on the National Party. Beginning among Labour MPs, hints that Don Brash had been having an extramarital affair were taken up in a National Party caucus meeting, and the matter leaked to a newspaper. Brash never admitted the allegation, but he did take some leave from Parliament to tend to his marriage. Most considered all this to be a private matter, but the person alleged to be the other party was a member of the Business Roundtable, an organisation representing conservative business opinion with close ties to many in the National Party, including Brash.</p>
         
         <p>Worse was to hit the National Party and its leader in the form of a book by investigative journalist Nicky Hager, who had obtained large amounts of documentary evidence from within the party that showed, in great detail, the background to its election strategy in 2005, and the extent to which Brash had been supported in his bid to become National Party leader by promises of increased financial support for the party by conservative forces outside National, including many active or former members of the Act Party and the Business Roundtable (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Hager 2006</a></span>). The impact of the book was so damaging that Brash attempted to prevent its publication by legal means. In a different league entirely from the muckraking of the <i>Investigate</i> magazine, the book documented in detail the inside workings of a contemporary political party at the highest levels, attempts both successful and unsuccessful to bypass its normal organisational processes, and demonstrated the extent to which the National Party was prepared to cloak its real objectives while concentrating on strategies designed to maximise electoral support.
         </p>
         
         <p>Hager also further refuted Brash's claim that he had little or no knowledge about a million dollar campaign mounted by the Exclusive Brethren to promote the National Party during the 2005 election campaign (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Vowles 2006</a></span>: 1216). Brash's contact with members of the Church had been even more extensive that had hitherto been revealed. The depth and extent of the material obtained by Hager was impressive, and its veracity was not denied. Hager claimed it had been provided to him by about half a dozen members of the Party. Those operating at high enough levels to have access to all the material in question were a relatively small group, and all denied responsibility. National alleged that the communications had been stolen, and yet another inquiry was set in motion.
         </p>
         
         <p>Political parties also clashed bitterly on the use of taxpayer funding of their parliamentary activities to support electioneering. The question was raised during the 2005 campaign, and subsequently investigated further. In February, the Electoral Commission ruled that, including the use of its parliamentary budget, Labour had breached the legal limits for advertising expenditure during the three‐month campaign period. The matter was referred to the police. National had also breached its broadcasting expenditure limit by failing to include the goods and services tax in its budget, and this too was referred to the police. No action was taken in either case. Making matters worse, the Auditor‐General found that all but one party had breached the rules for using taxpayer funding for electioneering, with Labour and New Zealand First being the worst offenders. The finding was contestable as such expenditures had been accepted in the past, although minor changes to the rules for the 2005 election had made them more questionable. National accused Labour of ‘stealing’ the election, despite having benefited itself from the broadcasting overspending it claimed as an inadvertent error, not to mention the Exclusive Brethren's million dollar campaign against Labour and the Greens that fell outside the letter, but not necessarily the spirit, of election expenditure regulation. Public opinion was stirred up, and it became too politically damaging for Labour to contest the findings, and all parties but New Zealand First pledged to repay the funds. New Zealand First continued to contest the Auditor‐General's ruling, and indicated that it would probably seek a legal review.</p>
         
         <p>Countering claims that it had run out of ideas and energy in its third term of Government, in October the Labour Party launched a new set of policies that would put New Zealand on the path to environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality. Having abandoned the idea of a carbon tax, and with achievement of the country's Kyoto targets increasingly unlikely, the Government hoped to restore its environmental credentials. With little dissent about the desirability of these goals, criticism centred on their extent and ambition, the absence of a timeline for their achievement and the modesty of the specific initiatives proposed. In another major initiative earlier in the year, the Government at last unbundled the telephone system, removing full monopoly control from Telecom, with the objective of enhancing broadband uptake. This belated initiative was intended to be the centrepiece of the annual budget, but key documents were leaked to the company's management, forcing an early announcement.</p>
         
         <p>Despite highly charged politics throughout the year, and the virulence of attacks on the Government and its members, party preferences remained finely balanced during 2006. Polls differed, some giving a consistent edge to Labour, others to the National Party. Most polls indicated that the margin was probably to National, but with some volatility, occasionally slipping back to Labour, but the gap showed signs of widening to National's advantage at year's end. The two main parties remained closely competitive, and of the small parties, only the Green Party was consistently polling above the 5 per cent party vote threshold for representation under New Zealand's Mixed Member Proportional Representation electoral system.</p>
         
         <p>‘One of the most bruising years in New Zealand's political history’ ended, effectively, a few days after the publication of Hager's book, with the resignation of Brash as leader of the National Party and the election of John Key to replace him. Key was widely expected to shift the National's strategy somewhat more towards the centre and to perform more successfully in Parliament than had Brash. While National had been damaged, as the next election looms, a more effective leadership and strategy from the Party could well tilt the balance of political forces more decisively toward the centre‐right. Many New Zealanders would also welcome political actors placing a greater emphasis on discussion of real issues, and less priority given to the politics of character assassination.</p>
