         <p>Théo Stendebach changed parliamentary group from DP (Liberal) to the CSV (Christian‐Social Party). Hence, the CSV group has 20 members and the DP 14, instead of 19 and 15 respectively as at the beginning of the legislature. As these are the two government parties, nothing changed in terms of majority size (34 seats out of 60), but the CSV now represents 59 per cent of the majority (and one‐third of all MPs in Parliament).</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>A number of institutional reforms initiated or debated during the previous years came into being in 2003. First, following the consultation, debates and presentation of a draft bill to Parliament by the Minister of Interior (see the entries on Luxembourg in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i> and <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>), the bill reforming the electoral law was voted on in February 2003. Its main innovation was the granting of voting rights for local elections to European Union (EU) citizens and non‐EU citizens who have resided in Luxembourg for at least five of the seven years preceding the elections.
         </p>
         
         <p>Second, after the introduction of a bill by the Parliamentary Committee for Institutions and Constitutional Reform in 2001 and the drafting of comments by the Government in 2002, the Council of State evaluated the texts that would change the process of constitutional revision in two advisory opinions (February and October). The bill was voted on by the Chamber of Deputies in December 2003. A number of important changes in the process (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>: 1063–1064; <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; De Winter 2003</a></span>) were introduced: first, a parliamentary dissolution is no longer necessary (after a declaration of revision proposal) to reform the constitution. This shortening of the process (as reform proposals will now be allowed to come into being within the same parliamentary term) was accepted by the Council of State as long as other requirements (like the qualified majority) made the process of revising the Constitution more demanding than for passing normal legislation. These requirements were also altered, however: the decision‐making rule for constitutional amendments is now two‐thirds of all MPs (instead of two‐thirds of those voting with a quorum of three‐quarters of all of them). Normally, a second vote has to be taken (with the same decision‐making rule) at least three months after the first one. However, if either one‐quarter of all MPs or 25,000 voters call for a referendum on the revision at hand (within the two months following the first vote of the Chamber), the result of the referendum would be binding and would replace the second vote of the Chamber of Deputies. Thus, voters would have a veto right in constitutional affairs, as a referendum held after a first positive vote of the Chamber that had a negative result would defeat the reform. It must be noted that the Council of State overruled the Government on a number of points: contrary to the will of the latter, the referendum on constitutional matters will be binding and the Government itself cannot call the referendum (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>: 1064).
         </p>
         
         <p>A step further for the introduction of instruments of direct democracy, promised since the governmental agreement of 1999, was taken in 2003 when the Prime Minister presented a draft bill on popular initiative in legislation: 10,000 voters would have the right to introduce a bill to the Chamber of Deputies. If the bill is turned down by the Chamber after the first reading, a (non‐binding) referendum could be held if 25,000 voters ask for it. The Government also introduced a draft bill implementing Article 51 of the Constitution, adopted in 1919, which allows referenda in Luxembourg. Although no law existed on the organisation of referenda, three of these were held in Luxembourg's history; the last one dating back to 1937 (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; De Winter 2003</a></span>). According to the draft bill, if two‐thirds of all MPs decide to call a referendum on a bill or an international treaty, the Government is obliged to organise it. By the end of 2003, no vote was taken on these proposals, although ever since late June the Council of Government decided that a referendum (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; De Winter 2003</a></span>) on the future European Constitution would be held in 2004 after all 25 Member States had signed it. This national referendum would serve as the instrument of ratification for the European Constitution.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, in July, the Chamber of Deputies voted on the creation of the position of mediator (ombudsperson) to facilitate relations and work for the resolution of conflicts between citizens and the civil service (including local administrations). Partly because the size of the country and its civil service permitted personal contacts and was thus supposed to prevent conflicts between citizens and administrative bodies (on this question, see <span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; Varone 2005</a></span>), Luxembourg was the last European Member State to adopt such legislation. Contrary to the French text founding this type of position that served as a template for the Luxembourg draft bill, any citizen can contact the mediator directly (in France, citizens can complain about administrative acts only through a MP) or indirectly. This position of mediator, attached to the Chamber of Deputies but independent from the civil service and the Government, was filled in December by Marc Fischbach, former judge at the European Court for European Rights.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In January François Biltgen, current Minister of Labour, became chairman of the CSV. The former chairperson was Erna Hennicot‐Schoepges, Minister of Higher Education.</p>
         
         <p>Mainly due to a generalised (in Europe) low growth rate, estimated for 2003 at 1.2 per cent in Luxembourg, the Government presented a draft budget for 2004 with a slight deficit (well below the 3 per cent threshold imposed by the stability and growth pact), a feature that is rare for the Grand Duchy. The tax cuts plans (see the entries on Luxembourg in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i> and <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>) were nevertheless implemented entirely. Not only did they not seriously endanger the financial balance of the state, but according to the Government and foreign observers even contributed to the preservation of a comparatively decent growth rate.
         </p>
         
         <p>In April, the bad economic situation and the prospects of cuts in employment in Belgium, France, Germany and Spain in the giant of steel company Arcelor led to violent demonstrations in front of the seat of the multinational company in Luxembourg city. The demonstration was organised only by the Belgian, French and German trade unions. The Luxembourguish trade unions refused to participate in the demonstration. They considered that such demonstrations did not respect Luxembourg's neo‐corporatist social model (institutionalised consultation between the Government, employers and unions at the macro‐social level of industrial relations; see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Allegrezza et al. 2003</a></span>). Unaccustomed to, and thus unprepared for such events, the Grand Ducal police had to be backed by Belgian brigades to maintain order; in particular, they used their anti‐demonstration trucks. On the other hand, according to the November social elections (for the representatives of trade unions in the professional chambers that are consultative bodies in the legislative process; see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Dumont &amp; De Winter 2003</a></span>) record low rate of participation, on average 30 per cent of workers entitled to vote showed up, social unrest did not translate in more conventional forms of protest.
         </p>
         
         <p>Turnout was 34.5 per cent for the Chamber of Private (white collar) Employees and below 30 per cent for the Chamber of Labour (workers). For the latter, the Socialist Trade Union OGBL gained more than 63 per cent of the votes, versus 31 per cent for the Christian Trade Union LCGB and 6 per cent for the FS, a trade union federation of ALEBA (Luxembourg Banking and Insurance Employees’ Union) and the Neutral Union of Luxembourg. Both the FS (18.5 per cent) and the LCGB (41 per cent) as expected performed better for the Chamber of Private Employees, whilst the OGBL (41 per cent) fared as high as the LCGB.</p>
         
         <p>In recent years, a recurrent sensitive field in Luxembourg politics is the sector of education. After having finally voted on a bill on the creation of a proper university (a project that was on the agenda for decades), the Government was forced to react to the bad figures of Luxembourg's students in the international survey PISA (see the entries on Luxembourg in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i> and <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>). In 2003, the project bill for the financing of private schools divided the Council of State to such an extent that it produced two separate and contradictory advisory opinions to the Government. Although only about 5 per cent of Luxembourg pupils would be affected by this bill, the lack of consensus in the legal advisory body of the Government revealed the persistent religious cleavage in Luxembourg's society (in June 2002, the Council of State also issued two separate opinions on the abolition of the teaching of moral or religious courses in public schools). The bill project at hand was intended to give state financing even to private schools that do not follow the country's education programmes (i.e., mainly international secondary schools populated by children of foreign residents working in international banks or institutions). Given that tuition in these private secondary schools can be as high as 15,000 euros per year, trade unions argue that equal access and freedom of choice is a fiction and state financing of these schools would lead to an education system with two speeds. The bill was adopted on 13 June without taking the Council State's negative advice into consideration.
         </p>
         
         <p>Luxembourg institutions took pioneering positions in two fields that are currently debated around the world and in international organisations. First, in January, the National Council of Ethics (a non‐political consultative body composed of scientists, representatives of different religions and beliefs designed to give advice to the Government) issued a very liberal recommendation on the use of human embryos in medical research. Even the production of human embryos, under a number of conditions, would be allowed for purely therapeutic purposes, but reproductive cloning would still be forbidden. If this recommendation is followed by legislation adopting the same views, Luxembourg will be one of the few countries with such a liberal legal stance. Second, the Environment Committee of the Chamber of Deputies adopted a rather uncommon position with regard to genetically modified crops (GMOs): the committee wants Luxembourg to be, like Austria, a GMO‐free zone. If EU legislation does not permit this request, MPs will require strict conditions for the entry of GMOs into the Grand Duchy. In October 2003, the Government declared that a bill project on palliative medicine will be introduced in 2004 and reaffirmed its opposition to legalising euthanasia.</p>
         
         <p>With regard to the sensitive issue of harmonisation of tax policy on savings in the EU, a first formal agreement was signed in June between Member States and Switzerland. The aim of the Directive is to render income from savings, in the form of interest payments made in one Member State to beneficial owners who are individual residents for tax purposes in another Member State, to be taxed in accordance with the laws of the Member State of residence. The automatic exchange of information between Member States concerning interest payments is the means chosen to achieve the effective taxation of these interest payments in the Member State of residence. Member States must therefore take the necessary measures to ensure that the tasks necessary for the implementation of this Directive – cooperation and exchange of banking information – are carried out by paying agents established within their territory, irrespective of the place of establishment of the debtor of the debt claim producing the interest. During a transitional period, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria are not required to exchange the information on savings income covered by this Directive if they apply a withholding tax to this income (at a 15 per cent rate during the first three years of the transitional period, 20 per cent for the subsequent three years and 35 per cent thereafter; Member States levying withholding tax shall retain 25 per cent of this revenue and transfer 75 per cent of the revenue to the Member State of residence of the beneficial owner of the interest; double taxation is forbidden). These three Member States may apply the transitional system until the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Andorra, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Principality of Monaco and the Republic of San Marino ensure effective and complete exchange of information upon request concerning payment of interest, and until the Council agrees unanimously that the United States is committed to exchange of information upon request as defined in the OECD Model Agreement. The Directive does, however, authorise these three Member States to receive information from the other Member States.</p>
         
         <p>Another question of national interest for Luxembourg in the EU concerned the financing of unemployment benefits for people who worked in a country other than the one in which they live, but are now on unemployment benefits. The European Commission had proposed that unemployment benefits should be paid by the country of the (lost) job location, a suggestion that was unacceptable for a country like Luxembourg where 38 per cent of internal employment is filled by non‐residents (from Belgium, France and Germany). A consensus was found in December: although the country of residence will still be the one paying the unemployment benefits, the country of employment will contribute (for at least three months). Moreover, Luxembourg managed to bargain for special treatment and a delay in application.</p>
         
         <p>With regard to the European Convention, there was a meeting in the beginning of April of the heads of State of seven countries (the Benelux countries plus Austria, Ireland, Finland and Portugal) in Luxembourg in order to issue a common position for the European Council in Athens. The Group of Seven called for equal treatment of all Member States in future European decision‐making, and for the maintenance and extension of the Community method. The principal requests were:</p>
         
         <p>• The European Commission guaranteeing the equality of all Member States in both its operation and its composition, based on the principle of equal rotation.</p>
         
         <p>• A Commission mandated with the exclusive right of initiative in legislative matters.</p>
         
         <p>• For the European Parliament, an extension of the co‐decision procedure in legislative matters. Reinforcement of the possibilities for national parliaments to exercise control over their representatives in Council.</p>
         
         <p>• The roles of High Representative for the CFSP and Commissioner for External Relations must be performed by a single person (with a ‘double hat’), who would enjoy the status of Commission Vice President, but operate in the fields of CFSP and CESDP under the authority of the Council.</p>
         
         <p>This coalition also disapproved the creation of new institutions. The Group of Seven rejected Valery Giscard D’Estaing's proposal to give the EU a powerful European Council president, with his own administration and powers. Rather, the Group of Seven pleaded for maintaining rotation of the presidency of the European Council and specialised councils. It also reaffirmed that, in any case, the seven countries would never accept a President elected from outside the Council. In Athens – the European summit that consecrated the enlargement of the EU at the end of April – a number of entering eastern and Mediterranean small countries (Cyprus, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Baltic Republics) joined the Group of Seven's position. In September, after the publication of the draft treaty establishing a constitution for Europe, however, the Benelux states refused to participate at the Prague Meeting of these countries, as they considered the criticisms of the draft from other small eastern and Mediterranean states to be too ‘eurosceptic’ and risked blocking ratification by the European Council in October at Rome. (For more information on Luxembourg, Benelux countries and the Convention, see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fayot &amp; Poirier (2004)</a></span>.)
         </p>
         
         <p>In March 2003, a public opinion survey ordered by the Government showed that 85 per cent of the Luxembourg population believed that the United States’ position in the world would be weakened because of its war against Iraq. A total of 64 per cent thought that terrorism would be fuelled by the war, while 55 per cent declared that the war would not have been avoided even if the EU had been united on the issue, and 51 per cent felt that the Luxembourg Government's position had not been clear before the beginning of the war. Indeed, even though in February 15,000 people had demonstrated in Luxembourg city against the war (this event gathered demonstrators from all over the Great Region consisting of Luxembourg, the French‐speaking Community and Walloon Region of Belgium, the Lorraine region of France, and German Saarland and Rheinland‐Pfalz), the Government's official position on 18 March was that ‘Luxembourg will not participate in the deployment of military troops in Iraq’ but ‘will nevertheless assume its commitments with allies and shares a will for a strong transatlantic relationship’.</p>
         
         <p>We should also note the creation of the Pierre Werner Institute (named in honour of a former Prime Minister who died in 2002, see the entry on Luxembourg in the <i>Political Yearbook 2002</i>) for a better understanding between different cultures, co‐financed by Luxembourg, France and Germany. It is also in 2003 that Luxembourg and the Great Region were chosen to be European Capital of Culture in 2007.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>
