         <p>The biggest conflict facing the Lipponen cabinet and the Finnish parliament during the year 2002 was the decision whether or not to build a fifth nuclear plant. A proposal to build a fifth nuclear plant had already been issued in 1993. At that time, the cabinet proposal was rejected by Parliament, although the majority coalition should have won the vote. The proposal split the cabinet parties and, as a result, the nuclear plant plans were taken off of the agenda. However, representatives for the industry continued to push their aims, and their position was strengthened when the consumption of electric energy continued to increase after the economic recession in the early 1990s. A proposal was raised again over the protest of the Greens in cabinet, including the Left‐Wing Alliance chairman Suvi Anne Siimes who was minister at the Ministry of Finance.</p>
         
         <p>The vote in Parliament took place on 24 May and the proposal was accepted by 107 ‘yes’ votes to 92 ‘no’. As the important vote received much media attention, no Members of Parliament (MPs) were absent, and only the chairman who presided at the session was kept from voting. The vote split all the parties except for the Greens, who all voted against. Nuclear energy is not popular in Europe where governments have faced demands to reduce the number of nuclear plants. In Finland, the result of the vote put the Greens into a dilemma: should they stay loyal to the cabinet or exit. To stay loyal could be hard to explain to their electorate and their sister parties in Europe. To choose to exit, on the other hand, would be, as had already been announced by the Prime Minister, an act of disloyalty, which could be turned against the Greens in the next cabinet coalition negotiations after the 2003 parliamentary elections. Two days after the vote, the Green Party council and the parliamentary party met to consider the situation. Few arguments were found to continue in cabinet and the overwhelming majority favoured an exit against the will of party chairman Osmo Soininvaara. As a result of this meeting, the decision was put into effect immediately.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>When the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) expanded, discussion was raised in Finland about whether to apply for membership. This question had been raised before, but this time the Minister of Defence, Jan‐Erik Enestam, made statements that were understood to be favourable towards membership. His statement was controversial, as a vast majority of the Finnish citizens rejected the idea in polls conducted during the year. As the preparations for the Iraq war continued during the autumn, sentiments against NATO membership grew even stronger. At that point, the Minister of Defence moderated his aims as the campaign for the March 2003 election came closer.</p>
         
         <p>Several ministers resigned during the year for various reasons. The Green chairman, Soininvaara, had to resign in April according to an agreement whereby SFP and the Greens shared the Ministry of Health and Social Service for two years each. The Minister of Transport and Communication, Olli‐Pekka Heinonen, was chosen to be director of the public television channels and was replaced by the Minister of Foreign Trade, Kimmo Sasi. Jari Vilén was chosen to be the new Minister of Foreign Trade after his first three years in Parliament. His reputation was questioned just before he took office, when it was suggested that his Master's thesis had been plagiarised. The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Kalvei Hemilä, resigned and became the director of the Food Industry Association. He was replaced by Raimo Tammilehto, who shortly afterwards resigned in favour of Jari Koskinen. This change was made in conjunction with the Green Party exit from the cabinet. The most dramatic resignation came when the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Suvi Lindén, informed Parliament at the end of May that she would leave her office. Prior to her decision, she had received much negative attention in the media and in Parliament. Lindén had used her position as government minister to give financial support to a golf club. Later on, it appeared that she was a shareholder in that particular club. It was therefore regarded as an unjust use of her position. She was replaced by a veteran MP, Kaarina Dromberg.</p>
