         <p>Renato Ruggiero formally resigned, but one could say that he was dismissed by Prime Minister Berlusconi, because of differences regarding the European Union (EU) and the Euro. While Ruggiero was a Euro‐enthusiast, the rest of the Government and the premier himself were much more sceptical. After a series of quarrels, the scepticism with which many ministers welcomed the Euro at the beginning of 2002 provided the <i>causus belli</i> for resignation. (For the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Claudio Scajola as Minister of the Interior, see the next section.)

         <p>The trend toward greater radicalisation in the political arena accelerated throughout 2002. The main issues around which political and social conflict converged were two: the introduction of new regulations concerning workers’ mobility and the various Government proposals to inhibit the longstanding judicial action against Berlusconi and his closest friends.</p>
         
         <p>The most dramatic outcome of the year, however, was the murder of a university law professor, Marco Biagi, who was killed on 19 March by the revived Red Brigade. This attack recalled the murder of Professor Massimo D’Antona in 1999, as both were consultants for the Ministry of Labour. While D’Antona cooperated with the centre‐left Government led by Massimo D’Alema, Biagi cooperated with Silvio Berlusconi's centre‐right Government. The reaction to the Biagi murder was very different to the general stigmatisation of the ‘attack against democracy and civil liberties’ raised on the occasion of the D’Antona killing. In the case of the attack on Biagi, the centre‐right did not hesitate to accuse the leftist trade union leaders of moral complicity with the Red Brigade. This was because the murder of Biagi occurred in a phase of very harsh confrontation between the Government and the industrialists’ association (<i>Confindustria</i>), on the one hand, and the trade unions (especially the largest one – the leftist CGIL), on the other, with regard to a project to reduce the protection of workers against dismissal provided by Article 18 of the Workers Statute.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The Biagi killing gained even more resonance and emotion when the family declared that the professor had long asked the police for protection, after receiving numerous anonymous threats. In spite of his requests, the Government and the police denied him protection, along with the dismantling of the ‘too generous’ service allocated by the centre‐left Government. Because of these inadequacies of the state apparatus, the Biagi family refused to meet Premier Berlusconi and the Ministry of the Interior, Claudio Scajola, and admitted only the President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, to honour the body of Professor Biagi. Furthermore, the Minister of the Interior, who had not even offered his resignation at the time, at the end of July declared that Biagi was just interested in gaining his honorarium and was, basically, a ‘pain in the ass’. Such an outrageous statement caused the Minister to resign, although not before resisting for a couple of days.</p>
         
         <p>Notwithstanding the Red Brigade assassination, the CGIL decided to maintain the scheduling of a massive rally in Rome, to be held a few days later, against the changes in the workers’ mobility regulations. On 23 March, the CGIL gathered some 3 million people in Rome for the largest demonstration ever to have occurred in Italy. The success and peaceful character of that rally contributed to toning down the acrimonious attacks by the right and, at the same time, in projecting the CGIL's uncontested leader, Sergio Cofferati, as a new, relevant ‘political’ figure, which was particularly significant when one considers that he was going to leave his position in the trade union in a few months.</p>
         
         <p>The very positive outcome of the Rome rally, on the other hand, increased the creeping divisions within organised labour. The other two trade unions – the Catholic‐moderate CISL and the small socialist‐inspired UIL – which had for a long time strictly cooperated with the CGIL, distanced themselves from it. Even if they all jointly organised an 8‐hour general strike on 16 April, which had a very high rate of participation (trade union sources numbered the strikers at 13 million workers) against the Government's economic and social policies (opposition to pension reform and to modification of Article 18 was the unifying glue of the three trade unions), the relationship among the three trade unions remained quite tense. In fact, the two minor trade unions signed a separate agreement on 4 July with the Government on the social and economic programme. This agreement, however, brought neither a decline in social unrest, because of opposition by the CGIL, nor a start up of the economy. Moreover, the industrialists’ association, which had firmly supported the centre‐right Government since the beginning, suddenly raised strong criticism to the state financial budget for 2003. As a consequence, by the end of the year, the ‘<i>concertazione</i>’ and industrial relations had made a leap backward: cooperation among the trade unions reached its lowest level since 1984, and even the solid alliance between government and <i>Confindustria</i> (basically at the heart of the workers’ protest) had been endangered.
         </p>
         
         <p>Such radicalisation of the conflict in industrial relations both horizontally (between trade unions) and vertically (between trade unions and their social and political counterparts) has been paralleled by an analogous trend in the political arena. Italian politics has been suffering since the mid‐1990s a process of radicalisation, mainly fostered by two components of the centre‐right, Umberto Bossi's regionalist‐autonomist <i>Lega Nord</i> and Silvio Berlusconi's neo‐conservative‐populist <i>Forza Italia</i>. On the other hand, the third major component of the alliance, the former neo‐fascist <i>Alleanza Nazionale</i>, precisely because of its origin, acted quite frequently as an agent of moderation. An even more responsible attitude has been displayed by the fourth component of the centre‐right, the Catholic UDC, which gathers the moderate wings of the former DC. Its role has been growing in the course of 2002, by counterbalancing the most radical positions of (mainly) the <i>Lega Nord</i> and by the more assertive role played by the Chairman of the <i>Camera dei Deputati</i>, the UDC leader Pier Ferdinando Casini.
         </p>
         
         <p>On the other side of the spectrum, the centre‐left coalition (the Olive Tree) entered the year 2002 without having yet overcome the shock of its 2001 general election defeat. A dramatic revelation of that status emerged at the end of a rally (2 February) promoted by the centre‐left parties to protest against the Government's repeated attacks on the independence and activity of magistrates. On that occasion, the famous film maker, Nanni Moretti, in front of the entire establishment of the DS and the centre‐left, provocatively denounced their inability to face the situation. The uproar – and agreement – raised in the leftist milieu by Moretti's ‘impolitic’ statement created the climate for the political mobilisation of civil society: a large number of local voluntary associations were either created or reinforced by the alarm bell rung by Moretti. All these groups, basically concerned with the defence or restoration of ‘legality’ endangered by the ‘conflict of interests’ of Mr Berlusconi and by the government bills intended to reduce the magistrates’ activity against political corruption, gave birth to a novel mode of protest: the ‘rally‐around’ (i.e., rallying around symbolic sites, such as a Palace of Justice, a Ministry, the headquarters of the public‐owned television station, and so on). The impetus for this mobilisation, which attracted especially the educated middle class rather than the youngster cohorts, was especially provided by the massive participation in the celebration of the decennial of the Clean Hands anti‐ political‐corruption investigation in Milan. The effect of this original protest movement was threefold: it revitalised the left‐wing milieu; fostered a sort of competition between the rally‐around supporters and the traditional leftist parties’ leadership; and kept alive a tough opposition to the Government, especially regarding the control of information and the attempt at avoiding or delaying the trials where Berlusconi and his friends were under investigation.</p>
         
         <p>The rally‐around movement and renewed trade union militancy shook the larger party of the centre‐left coalition, the DS. The two lines, which had confronted each other in the national congress held in autumn 2001, sharpened their contrast: the reformist majority, represented by the general secretary Piero Fassino and backed by Massimo D’Alema, went under attack by the left faction because of the former's supposedly too mild attitude <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the Government. The cleavage between the two factions deepened to the point of risking a rupture, especially when the CGIL leader, having left his position inside the trade union, joined the leftist faction. Even if the DS was profoundly divided into two mutually hostile factions, it recovered somewhat both electorally, in minor local tests, and politically, being able to confront the Government more vigorously.
         </p>
         
         <p>The more centre‐oriented components of the Olive Tree coalition, on the other hand, coalesced on 24 April into a single party, the ‘Daisy’, led by the prime ministerial candidate from the 2001 general elections, Francesco Rutelli. This new formation, which thus far has reduced the fragmentation within the centre‐left, was basically dominated by the former left‐wing Catholics of the PPI and, to a lesser extent, by the followers of former Premier Romano Prodi. In this way, the dominance of the DS over the other parties was reduced and a sort of balance of power emerged between Daisy and DS leaving to the margin the other components of the Olive Tree (Communists and Greens). Finally, the remaining component of the left outside the Olive Tree coalition, <i>Rifondazione Comunista</i>, tried to profit from the radicalisation process and, in this vein, promoted a referendum to extend to all factories the provisions of the famous Article 18 on workers’ mobility (up to now, limited to factories with more than 15 employees).
         </p>
         
         <p>On the right side of the spectrum, <i>Forza Italia</i> and Berlusconi himself continue to dominate the coalition without exception. The other right‐wing parties attempted to overcome this hegemony in different ways. The most successful has been the <i>Lega Nord</i>. Notwithstanding its poor results in the 2001 general elections, which made its seats superfluous for a majority in Parliament, the party and especially its leader, Umberto Bossi, were able to determine to a certain extent the political agenda, especially on immigration and devolution. On the former issue, a new bill was passed with the aim of stopping the flow of immigration and regularising or expelling clandestine immigrants, in tune with the hard line promised to the party's electoral constituency. Actually, immigration did not diminish and a mass of clandestine people (over 800,000) applied for regularisation, while very few were expelled. With regard to devolution, the <i>Lega Nord</i> had to balance its drive to hyperfederalism with the ‘unitary’ tendency diffused in the majority itself and shared by the President of the Republic. Oddly enough, the <i>Lega</i>'s federalism did not involve the European context: on the contrary, the EU had become a target of the most brutal attacks as it was defined by Bossi himself as ‘a Stalinist superstate . . . the Soviet Union of the West’ during the 4th <i>Lega Nord</i> national congress held in March.
         </p>
         
         <p>The small Catholic‐moderate UDC, as mentioned above, succeeded in gaining the role of the moderate and bargaining‐oriented component, thus acquiring far more relevance in the political arena. Finally, <i>Alleanza Nationale</i> (AN) continued to suffer from its lack of identity and strategy. During 2002, it has been the least visible party in the coalition. No project or bill had its sole and distinctive imprint. The Government vice‐president and party leader Gianfranco Fini took the opportunity of his nomination to the European Convention to gain credibility in Europe. He skilfully played the role of the ‘responsible and accountable’ leader, but neglected both to provide the party with adequate guidelines in the domestic field and to finally eradicate from the party's rank‐and‐file the remnants of fascist nostalgia. The first AN national congress since its foundation in January 1995, held in March, highlighted the gap between Fini himself and other components of the leadership group, as the latter vindicated in congress the old good days of AN's neofascist predecessor the MSI, to which all leaders had belonged. As a result, AN has continued to keep a low profile, as if it was waiting for a post‐Berlusconi setting.
         </p>
         
         <p>Other events are worthy of mention. These include: the question of Government control over the publicly owned television station and the request (rapidly fulfilled) by Prime Minister Berlusconi to fire two prominent anti‐government television journalists; the revealing of the Fiat Company crisis; the approval of a bill that introduced the right of those being prosecuted to change judge for ‘<i>legittima suspicione</i>’– a bill tailored for Berlusconi's lawyer, Cesare Previti, under trial in Milan for judicial corruption, in order to delay the trial and inhibit a court judgement; the doubling of the state's party finance; the address by the President of the Republic to Parliament on the pluralism of information; and the resignation of all of the university rectors protesting the cut in the education budget.
         </p>
         
         <p>In conclusion, during the year 2002 the confrontational or adversarial style in Italian politics was rooted even more deeply than before. While lawmaking in the parliamentary committees appears to remain quite consensual, the two opposing coalitions display a very high level of mutual distrust. The radicalisation of the political discourse continues to permeate the political arena. The centre‐right coalition is led, even ‘dominated’, by Berlusconi, but the relationship between the moderate Catholic UDC and the <i>Lega</i> (which nowadays is the rightmost party in the Italian party system) is quite tense, especially with regard to immigration and the EU. On the other side, the centre‐left suffers from a lack of leadership. The 2001 prime ministerial candidate, Francesco Rutelli, has successfully gathered the more centre‐oriented parties of the Olive Tree into the new Daisy party, but has not maintained a profile of authentic leadership of the whole coalition. The DS is still embroiled in endless internal quarrels and somewhat scared by both the civic mobilisation of the ‘rally‐around’ movement and the growing appeal of the former trade union leader Cofferati.
