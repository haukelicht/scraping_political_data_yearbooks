         <p>For most of 2002, German politics was dominated by the run‐up to the general election in September. In the event, it turned out to be the most exciting election night most political observers could remember and it was after midnight before politicians of the governing red‐green coalition could be reasonably certain that they had managed to hold on to power by the smallest possible margin – they had gained a majority of 4 seats over an absolute majority. One year earlier, few would have predicted such a close race, given that the CDU was still struggling to recover from a major party finance scandal in which former Chancellor Helmut Kohl had played a central role. This was reflected by the hesitant approach of the eventual Chancellor‐candidate, CSU leader Edmund Stoiber, who waited until early 2002 before he declared his intention to stand.</p>
         
         <p>While Stoiber's entering the race improved the Christian parties’ performance in the polls, things started to go wrong for the governing Social Democrats. In March, a major party finance and corruption scandal was exposed in the city of Cologne with the Social Democrats at its centre. Probably even more damaging was the news that unemployment figures reached a four‐year high in June. The collapse of a major building company, which Gerhard Schröder had helped to rescue with state subsidies some two years earlier, undermined belief in the economic competence of the Chancellor further. Similarly, the ill‐orchestrated removal of the chairman of the publicly controlled Telekom in July did little to enhance public confidence in the managerial skills of the Government.</p>
         
         <p>To make things worse, Social Democratic Defence Minister and former party leader Rudolf Scharping was sacked from the Government in July over an affair involving alleged presents and publications fees from a Christian Democratic public relations consultant. Extraordinarily, it took Chancellor Schröder only a few seconds to publicly announce the dismissal. Finally, also in July, politicians of both governing parties found themselves implicated in a scandal over the private use of air miles they had accumulated while travelling on public missions. This led to the resignations of the popular Green Member of Parliament (MP) Cem Özdemir and the former leader of the PDS <i>Bundestag</i> faction, Gregor Gysi. While the swift departure of Özdemir was a successful exercise in damage limitation, Gysi's demise deprived the struggling PDS of its major electoral asset and contributed to the party's failure to overcome the 5 per cent hurdle in the <i>Bundestag</i> elections.
         </p>
         
         <p>It came as a considerable relief to the struggling Social Democrats that the Liberals were unable to contain the news of an affair that involved deputy chairman Jürgen Möllemann. Möllemann had cultivated a relationship with a Syrian‐born former Green Land MP who had been accused of anti‐Semitic tendencies. Möllemann dealt a final blow to Liberal hopes for a good election result when he distributed an election leaflet that was widely perceived to have anti‐Israeli, if not anti‐Semitic, overtones. After election day, the affair led to deep divisions within the FDP and the eventual resignation of Jürgen Möllemann from all party offices. Somewhat later he also ceased being a party member.</p>
         
         <p>Unprecedented levels of personalization reminiscent of presidential election campaigns characterized the election campaign itself. Upon the announcement of Edmund Stoiber's candidature, Gerhard Schröder set the tone by stating that the election would be about a choice between ‘him or me’. The Christian Democrats reacted by subjecting their candidate to substantial image engineering, ‘creating’ a moderate, centrist Stoiber who steered clear of any pronounced positions. The FDP and the Greens followed suit. Quite daringly, the FDP enthroned party leader Guido Westerwelle as Chancellor‐ candidate and Westerwelle went on to tour the Republic in the yellow ‘Guidomobile’ camper van. The Greens, who had started out in the early 1980s as a party highly critical of personalization, officially selected <i>de facto</i> party leader Joschka Fischer as their leading candidate and focused their entire election campaign on him, including a ‘second vote campaign’ which used the slogan ‘second vote is a Joschka vote’.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the absence of significant substantive debate, the personality of the leaders was of heightened relevance. In this context, it was a godsend for the Government that the flood catastrophe in East Germany presented Chancellor Gerhard Schröder with the opportunity to present himself as a capable manager in times of crisis while his contender was relegated to the sidelines. It is not without irony that a flood, arguably not unrelated to global warming, rescued the first national government to have the Green Party at the cabinet table. In the same month, preliminary results of a government commission on labour market reform (the so‐called ‘Hartz Commission’) were presented and helped to improve perceptions of the coalition's economic competence. This coincided with the looming crisis over Iraq, which was also skilfully (and quite ruthlessly) used by Gerhard Schröder to turn electoral fortunes around.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t4" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The presidentialized nature of the election campaign was highlighted by two television debates between Schröder and Stoiber. While the first one was widely considered to be a draw, Schröder clearly ‘won’ the second confrontation, and this coincided with a significant improvement for the SPD in the opinion polls. Still, the overall outcome of the contest remained uncertain. Having said this, the alternatives were clearer than four years earlier because the Social Democrats had unequivocally committed themselves to continuing the incumbent coalition should the result permit it. Nevertheless, a Grand Coalition or a Christian‐Liberal coalition remained a possibility until election day.</p>
         
         <p>In the event, the Government, which was returned with a tiny majority, was rescued by an unexpectedly good performance by the Greens. The party increased its vote by 1.9 per cent (compared to 1998) and managed to win a direct seat (in Berlin) for the first time in its history. A closer look at the results shows, however, that much of the Green gain was at the expense of its Social Democratic coalition partner. According to surveys, about 30 per cent of Green voters stated that the party of their first choice was the Social Democrats. In the light of this finding, it comes as little surprise that coalition negotiations were not hampered by excessive Green demands. They retained their three cabinet posts, while the most conspicuous innovation was the appointment of the North Rhine‐Westphalian Prime Minister Wolfgang Clement as ‘superminister’ for economics and labour.</p>
         
         <p>Shortly after the new government had assumed office, it ran into troubled waters when the deepening budgetary crisis became apparent and it reacted with a series of tax rises. The Opposition responded with allegations of electoral deceit and successfully called for a parliamentary inquiry into whether the Government had been aware of the financial malaise before election day. Not unexpectedly, the outcome of the inquiry was inconclusive.</p>
         
         <p>The Greens, once again, lost a successful party leadership as a result of the insistence of the party congress to maintain the separation of office and mandate. Since both party leaders had won <i>Bundestag</i> seats, they resigned from the party leadership shortly after the <i>Bundestag</i> election. Eventually, it was decided that this issue should be resolved by a membership referendum in 2003. After the election, CDU leader Angela Merkel was also elected leader of the joint parliamentary party of CDU and CSU.
         </p>
         
         <p>Further events throughout 2002 include the following. In January, it became apparent that Germany would be unable to adhere to the 3 per cent budget deficit limit required for members of the Euro‐Zone. In February, it was revealed that the Public Labour Office had vastly over‐reported the number of jobs that they had been able to offer to the unemployed. After long deliberations, in March, the Greens approved a new basic programme that fundamentally revised many of their core positions. Most notably, they now accept the use of military force under certain conditions.</p>
