         <p>The riots provoked by the wanton killing of a teenager by a trigger‐happy policeman in early December 2008 (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 971) continued well into 2009, producing an unprecedented widespread feeling of insecurity.
         </p>
         
         <p>To repair somehow the negative image of his government, Prime Minister Karamanlis proceeded on 8 January to undertake a cabinet reshuffle which failed, once again, to meet expectations and therefore made matters even worse. Economics professor G. Alogoskoufis was replaced as ‘economy czar’ by his hitherto vice‐minister G. Papathanasiou. The latter's prior career as president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry (EVEA) promised better communication with business. In contrast, the prior career of Chr. Folias as president of the National Confederation of Greek Commerce (ESEE) apparently did not guarantee success and/or longevity in the Ministry of Development, where he was replaced. In the Ministry of Education, the replacement of E. Stylianidis by A. Spiliotopoulos signified less conflict, but also less continuity with past policy.</p>
         
         <p>As became clear later in the year, the most consequential change was the return of Antonis Samaras to the cabinet after almost twenty years (most of them spent as leader of the splinter party POLAN until 2004). His responsibility for bringing down the Mitsotakis Government in 1993 could never be forgiven by ND party loyalists and especially by the Mitsotakis family. Others may never forgive and forget the historic responsibility of Samaras as Foreign Minister for ruling out a timely compromise on the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, when such a compromise appeared feasible and compatible with Greek national interest. The entry of Samaras as Minister of Culture allowed him to start immediately revamping his tarnished image thanks to events such as the grand inauguration of the stunning new Acropolis Museum in July. The entry of Samaras also eased the exit of M. Liapis, first cousin of the Prime Minister and a perpetual embarrassment, especially whenever he implied that he had an equal claim to the charismatic legacy of their common uncle, the great statesman Konstantinos Karamanlis (1907–1998).</p>
         
         <p>The image of an exhausted government persisted after the cabinet reshuffle. So did the unfolding revelations of scandals, including primarily the bribes paid by the German firm Siemens to Greek officials and, apparently, to both major Greek parties, mostly before 2004, under PASOK (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 968). Although both major parties were implicated, the ND majority managed to convey the impression of an intended cover‐up on its part by refusing the PASOK demand of a parliamentary inquiry in May. A similar impression was created by the parliamentary refusal to allow the criminal prosecution of A. Pavlidis, Minister for the Aegean in the previous ND Government, accused of soliciting bribes. In sharp contrast, former PASOK minister Chr. Verelis resigned his parliamentary seat as soon as a new scandal was publicised involving his name.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meanwhile, in February, the 18th Congress of the KKE essentially rehabilitated Stalinism, confirming the party's refusal to adapt to contemporary realities.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The European election of 7 June 2009</h2>
         
         <p>In Greece, this was undoubtedly the most indifferent election to the European Parliament (EP) to date, even though PASOK sought to transform it into a ‘referendum’ against the government. The two major parties announced their tickets barely three weeks earlier, on 17 May. On the ND ticket, M. Giannakou returned to the EP, where she had apparently been more effective in the 1980s than as Minister of Education in 2004–2007. On the PASOK side, party spokesman G. Papakonstantinou headed the ticket, but both he and others were evidently intended to be temporary in that capacity. Last on both tickets were two representatives of business: on the ND side, G. Kasimatis, president of the Central Union of Chambers; on the PASOK side, D. Asimakopoulos, president of GSEVEE representing small businessmen (who are an overwhelming majority in the Chambers). Also on the ND ticket was K. Poupakis, secretary‐general of the peak labour confederation GSEE and leader of DAKE (the ND organisation in trade unions). Both major parties casually exhibited their joint penetration of interest groups, undisturbed by the contradictions involved (cf. <span title=""><a href="#b2%20#b3%20#b5" id="#b2 #b3 #b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 1993, 1997, 2007</a></span>: 996).
         </p>
         
         <p>The level of abstention from this European election in Greece was the highest in living memory. If the official rate of 47.3 per cent was false, deriving from the false figure of 10 million registered voters, true abstention was still around 38 per cent. In absolute numbers, no less than 1,783,124 people who voted in October 2009 had not bothered to vote in June. Apart from this overall show of indifference, the electoral results were also disappointing for every party (with only two exceptions). Compared to the previous European election in 2004, ND lost a staggering 10.7 per cent of the vote, but PASOK gained only 2.6 per cent. In terms of the number of seats, they were equal. This did not prevent PASOK from claiming victory and demanding the immediate dissolution of Parliament. For its part, the KKE lost 1.1 per cent instead of increasing its share as it had hoped.</p>
         
         <p>Compared to 2004, SYRIZA (the electoral alliance around SYN) gained a mere half percentage point, but fell below its national average in 2007 (5 per cent). In February 2008, when the youthful A. Tsipras had been suddenly elevated to the leadership of SYN, expectations had been as high as 18 per cent (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 969). Compared to them, the performance of SYRIZA in the European election was a resounding fiasco, which exacerbated internal disputes. In a move that further eroded his credibility, A. Alavanos announced his resignation as chairman of the SYRIZA parliamentary group, only to retract it a few days later.
         </p>
         
         <p>Apart from abstention, there were nonetheless two victors: LAOS, which almost doubled its share and became the fourth party in Greece displacing SYRIZA; and the Ecologists Greens, who won for the first time a seat in the EP and thereby acquired recognition and public financing like LAOS in 2004 (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2005</a></span>: 1031).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> The parliamentary election of 4 October 2009</h2>
         
         <p>On 2 September, in a dramatic televised address, Prime Minister K. Karamanlis announced the dissolution of Parliament and an early election on 4 October, barely two years after the previous one. He invoked two main reasons: the mounting economic crisis and PASOK's declared intention of provoking an automatic dissolution in early 2010 by boycotting the reelection of K. Papoulias as President of the Republic. As in 2007, Karamanlis evidently sought to pre‐empt the further erosion of electoral support for his government, and ensure the shortest possible electoral campaign. This time, however, his decision was openly criticised as disastrous by several ND ministers (including D. Avramopoulos and A. Samaras). It was even attributed to the self‐serving advice of Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyanni, eager to grab the party leadership in the wake of electoral defeat. These recriminations precipitated the formation of opposing camps in the coming leadership contest.</p>
         
         <p>Otherwise the electoral campaign was muted, despite the novelty of a televised personal debate between the two major contenders (Karamanlis and Papandreou). ND sought to capitalise on the lingering popularity of the Prime Minister, despite the widespread exasperation with his government. Belatedly admitting its own mistakes and failures, ND proclaimed the need for responsibility and restraint in the face of the economic crisis, and denounced the irresponsible absence of a concrete programme on the part of PASOK. Apart from the lack of credibility, however, what principally plagued the ND campaign was that it promised only austerity with a view to decreasing the runaway public debt.</p>
         
         <p>In sharp contrast, PASOK offered not only a stimulus package to boost demand, but also the attractively vague prospect of ‘green development’ as a new model for the country – green being also the party's colour and a green sun its emblem (cf. <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 1983</a></span>). Although fully informed about the actual state of the economy and the public deficit, George Papandreou cheerfully proclaimed that the country's problem was not the lack of resources but only their mismanagement. This was enough to hand him the premiership after an overwhelming victory at the polls (see <a href="#t3" class="scrollableLink">Table 3</a>).

         <p>Dropping to its lowest percentage <i>ever</i>, ND was not the only loser in this election. On the left, both the KKE and SYRIZA lost votes and a seat each. Nonetheless, the election may have barely saved SYRIZA from disintegration, which had appeared imminent. Instead, it offered an exit from the escalating confrontation between A. Alavanos and his anointed heir but subsequent foe A. Tsipras (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 969). Alavanos did not run for Parliament, whereas Tsipras was elected to it for the first time. For their part, the Ecologists Greens failed to consolidate their gains in the preceding European election. Falling short of the 3 per cent threshold, they were denied parliamentary representation. LAOS was the only other winner (beside PASOK). It consolidated its position as the fourth party nationwide, and even displaced the KKE from third place in several districts, mostly in Northern Greece. The most spectacular gain of LAOS was in seats, which it increased by 50 per cent.

         <p>The first government of George A. Papandreou was sworn in on 7 October, and received a vote of confidence in the early hours of 19 October. Although it was advertised as drastically smaller than its predecessors, this was reflected only in the reduced number of vice‐ministers. Cabinet posts decreased merely by one, because mergers of ministries and the abolition of the last remaining ‘regional’ ministry (Macedonia‐Thrace) were offset by the reconstitution of two posts (Economy and Public Order) and the resurrection of yet another, absent for several decades. This was the post of Deputy Prime Minister (literally ‘vice‐chairman’) entrusted to Th. Pangalos as a political heavyweight and the most experienced among the few former PASOK ministers retained by Papandreou. These included his erstwhile rival for the PASOK leadership E. Venizelos and the latter's acolyte A. Loverdos. The other two were D. Reppas and M. Chrysochoidis, praised as Minister of Public Order under Simitis, who returned to his old post, now revamped as ‘Protection of the Citizen’. This was only the most imaginative among several changes in the designations of ministries (see <a href="#t4" class="scrollableLink">Table 4</a>). In December, Chrysochoidis was to adopt a policy of zero tolerance towards the attempted repetition of the 2008 riots (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2009</a></span>: 971). Otherwise, the government was composed mostly of Papandreou's cronies, making up in earnestness what they lacked in experience. He kept for himself his old portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Finally, the single most spectacular novelty was the inclusion of five women ministers, among whom former EU Commissioner A. Diamantopoulou was by far the most prominent and most experienced.

         <p>To impress public opinion, novelty was also sought in other ways. In the pursuit of ‘transparency’, even official meetings of the Council of Ministers were transformed into televised talk shows, with invited guests like Archbishop Iakovos. All this only served to underline the fact that actual decisions were taken elsewhere – outside institutional settings, whether of the government or of the party.</p>
         
         <p>As with PASOK in 2007 (<span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2008</a></span>: 995–996), electoral defeat precipitated a crisis of leadership in ND. The PASOK precedent also made it impossible to refuse the direct election of the party leader by the rank‐and‐file (in place of the statutory representative assembly, where Dora Bakoyanni was apparently sure to win). In November 2007, some 738,000 PASOK members and ‘friends’ were reported to have voted. This time, turnout was even higher: 782,316 ND members voted on 29 November 2009. Most of them reportedly registered on that very day.
         </p>
         
         <p>A key difference, however, was the attitude of the party leader. Unlike Papandreou in 2007, Karamanlis resigned the leadership on the very night of the election, assuming full responsibility for the debacle. It is actually probable that he had resolved to free himself from the responsibilities of office and the burdens of leadership even before he called the premature election, which he could not possibly win in any case. What remains a matter of conjecture is whether, by bringing Antonis Samaras into the government back in January, Karamanlis was already promoting him as an eventual successor against the better‐placed Dora Bakoyanni. Another matter of conjecture is whether Dimitris Avramopoulos, as one of the original four contenders, deliberately demanded a direct election by the membership in order to boost the chances of Samaras, whom Avramopoulos openly supported after withdrawing his own candidacy later. If either conjecture is true, Dora Bakoyanni may have fallen victim to machinations of the kind usually attributed to her father, former Prime Minister K. Mitsotakis. In the end, the controversial past of Samaras did not prevent him from winning a bare majority of 50.1 per cent on the first round, against 39.7 per cent for Bakoyanni. The remaining 10.2 per cent was won by Panagiotis Psomiadis, the colourful populist prefect of Thessaloniki. In ideological terms, the election of Samaras signified a clear victory of ND's conservatives over the liberals identifying with Bakoyanni.</p>
         
         <p>The fact that A. Samaras and G. Papandreou have known each other since they were students (and even roommates) at Amherst College not only highlights the worsening elitism of Greek politics at the top, but might also facilitate – in another country – the bipartisan consensus required to deal with the economic crisis. Not in Greece, however, where confrontation and short‐sighted partisanship systematically overrule other options. Just like ND in 2004 (<span title=""><a href="#b4" id="#b4R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Mavrogordatos 2005</a></span>: 1031), the new PASOK Government immediately accused its predecessor of concealing a desperate economic situation and revealed a public deficit estimated at a staggering 12.7 per cent of GDP (which PASOK had known all along). The Papandreou Government was thus setting in motion a chain of reactions quite beyond its control, with worldwide repercussions in early 2010, as the spectre of a default on the part of Greece undermined confidence in the euro. Meanwhile, the emergency meeting of party leaders called by the President of the Republic on 15 December was spent and wasted on platitudes and generalities about how to combat corruption.
