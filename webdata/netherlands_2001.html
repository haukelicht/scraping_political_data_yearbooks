         <p>The elections for municipal councils held on 6 March were regarded by many parties as a rehearsal for the general elections of 15 May. The main winners of the local elections were the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), which reinforced its position as the strongest party at the local level, and a variety of local parties. Many of these local parties had been founded in the 1990s as a populist protest against the established parties that were considered bureaucratic, arrogant and elitist. The most successful local party was <i>Leefbaar Rotterdam</i> (Livable Rotterdam), founded just before the elections and led by the colourful Pim Fortuyn – formerly a sociology professor at the University of Rotterdam and, at the time of the elections, an independent writer and public speaker. With 35 per cent of the votes, it became the largest party in the municipal council of the second largest city in The Netherlands.
         </p>
         
         <p>The local victory also boosted Fortuyn's career in national politics. In November 2001, he was elected leader of <i>Leefbaar Nederland</i> (Livable Netherlands), a party that was founded formally in June 2001 by leaders of two local parties with similar names (<i>Leefbaar Utrecht</i> and <i>Leefbaar Hilversum</i>). Yet in February 2002 he was forced to resign by the national executive committee of the party because of statements he had made about immigrants. Fortuyn had already caused controversy in the 1990s with his book entitled <i>Against the Islamization of The Netherlands</i>. In his election campaign in Rotterdam, he had linked the issues of immigration and insecurity. After the conflict with <i>Leefbaar Nederland</i>, Fortuyn decided to take part in the parliamentary elections with a list of like‐minded people – the List Pim Fortuyn (<i>Lijst Pim Fortuyn</i>, LPF). By way of party manifesto, he wrote a book that combined a critical analysis of government policy with autobiographical elements. Ideologically, he combined economic liberalism with populist demands for a more open and democratic political system, nationalism and a communitarian preference for small communities, small schools and small hospitals. The combination of personal revelations (e.g., about his homosexual activities and unhappy love affairs) and a rather abstract analysis of social problems characterized his style, also in public debates. Other politicians were often puzzled by his performance. Yet his supporters loved it and his popularity increased rapidly. Critics, however, compared him with right‐wing leaders like Haider, Le Pen or Mussolini. Worried about the prospect of Fortuyn leading the country, a young animal rights activist assassinated him on 6 May.
         </p>
         
         <p>The election campaign immediately came to a halt. However, the elections were not postponed, in part because the Government did not want to offend the mourning supporters of Fortuyn. On 15 May, 1.4 million people voted for the late Fortuyn – partly a ‘condolence vote’, partly a protest vote. Another 250,000 people voted for other candidates on the List Pim Fortuyn. Thus the LPF became the second largest party in parliament.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The three government parties paid a heavy price for eight years of ‘purple coalition’ (called ‘purple’ because it was a mixture of (red) socialism and (blue) liberalism). Together PvdA, D66 and VVD lost 43 out of 97 seats. In economic terms, the Government had been rather successful – even foreign observers had praised the ‘polder model’. Yet problems in the public sector, like shortages of teachers in schools and police in the street, waiting lists in hospitals, as well as the sometimes technocratic style of the Government, detracted from its popularity. Moreover, since 11 September 2001, public debate had focused on the growing presence of Muslim immigrants, who were not sufficiently ‘integrated’ into Dutch society, at least according to many observers.</p>
         
         <p>The growing dissatisfaction with the ‘purple coalition’ was mobilized not only by Pim Fortuyn and his movement, but to a lesser extent also by the Christian Democrats and the left‐wing populist Socialist Party (SP). All three criticized the notion of a multicultural society and argued for more integration (if not assimilation) of immigrants. However, CDA and SP did not agree with Fortuyn that immigration should be reduced to zero (if possible). Both parties did well in the elections. The CDA won back many supporters that had left its ranks in the 1990s, yet also attracted some young voters who were not always committed Christians but who shared some of the (conservative) values of the Christian Democrats.</p>
         
         <p>Other opposition parties did not benefit from the public mood. Green Left lost a seat; it had defended multiculturalism and its leader had criticized Fortuyn in strong terms – as a consequence, he could not appear in the street without bodyguards for several months. Moreover, the man who had killed Fortuyn was associated with Green Left, even if he was not a party member. The loss of the Christian Union – a confederation of two Protestant parties: the Reformed Political Union (<i>Gereformeerd Politiek Verbond</i>, GPV) and the Reformed Political Federation (<i>Reformatorische Politieke Federatie</i>, RPF) – seems more surprising. Probably some supporters of these parties resented the merger, while others might have switched to the CDA for strategic reasons. <i>Leefbaar Nederland</i> entered Parliament with only two seats. Without a well‐known leader and a clear ideological profile, the party failed to find a niche in the party system.

            <p>On 16 April, Prime Minister Wim Kok resigned. He was followed by his complete cabinet. He felt responsible for the failure of the Dutch United Nations (UN) troops to prevent the fall of Srebrenica in 1995 during the Bosnian Civil War and the subsequent murder of several thousand Muslims in that area. A thorough study by the Dutch Institute for War Documentation had led him to the conclusion that the Dutch government shared responsibility for the disaster, even if the crimes had been committed by Serbian Bosnians. Kok was also Prime Minister in 1995 and a member of the preceding cabinet, which had taken the ill‐fated decision in 1993 to take part in the UN mission without sufficient preparation. After resigning, the Government continued to act as a caretaker until after the elections of 15 May.</p>
            
         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss4"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss4-title"> Cabinet formation</h3>
            
            <p>The formation of a new cabinet tends to be a time‐consuming process in The Netherlands. By Dutch standards, the formation did not take much time in 2002: only 68 days. On 17 May, the Queen appointed a Christian Democratic constitutional lawyer and member of the State Council (<i>Raad van State</i>), Piet Hein Donner, as <i>informateur</i>. He realized quite soon that the only realistic option was a coalition of CDA, LPF and VVD. Though the VVD leader, Gerrit Zalm, proved at first reluctant, expressing his preference for a minority coalition of CDA and LPF, he was nevertheless persuaded to enter negotiations. On 3 July, Donner concluded the information period by presenting a ‘Strategic Agreement’ (<i>Strategisch Akkoord</i>) between the three parties, a programme for the next government. The government would restrict immigration, encourage integration of immigrants, reduce the tolerance of soft drugs, reform health care, increase the autonomy of schools, and reduce real estate taxes as well as disability payments and government spending. The parliamentary groups of CDA, LPF and VVD accepted the agreement. On 22 July, the Queen installed the new cabinet, formed by CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende. Seven hours later, a state secretary (junior minister) of the LPF, Philomena Bijlhout, resigned when it turned out that she had lied about her political past in Surinam.

         </section><section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss5"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss5-title"> October crisis</h3>
            
            <p>The LPF turned out to be a rather unstable coalition partner – hardly surprising for a party that lacked a coherent ideology as well as formal organization, and that had lost its political leader and <i>spiritus rector</i> just before the elections. The four ministers who represented the LPF had very little in common: Eduard Bomhoff had been a member of the PvdA, Hilbrand Nawijn a local councillor for the CDA, Roelf de Boer belonged to the VVD and Herman Heinsbroek had no political experience at all. Personal relations were often strained, especially between the calculating academic Bomhoff and the flamboyant businessman Heinsbroek. Tensions rose when the ministers became involved in a power struggle within the parliamentary party of the LPF. When the parliamentary group began to fall apart, Heinsbroek intervened on one side, whereas Bomhoff and the provisional executive committee of the party took the other. Unable to control the conflict between the two LPF ministers, CDA and VVD leaders decided to dissolve the coalition and call for new elections. On 16 October, Balkenende tendered the resignation of his cabinet to the Queen. His Government would act as caretaker until the anticipated elections (to be held on 22 January 2003), but without the two controversial LPF ministers.

            <p>A minor crisis occurred on 12 December when Benk Korthals (VVD) resigned as Minister of Defence. A parliamentary investigation committee had concluded that Korthals had given false information to Parliament as Minister of Justice in the Kok II cabinet about a deal between the state prosecutor and building contractors. His resignation did not have political consequences for the cabinet.</p>

            <p>In 2001, both houses of Parliament approved a temporary law allowing consultative referenda. A constitutional amendment to allow binding abrogatory referenda was passed as well, but had to be voted upon again (with a two‐third's majority) after the parliamentary elections of May 2002. However, the new government declared that it would not support the amendment. Thus the prospects for a referendum looked rather dim by the end of the year.</p>
            
            <p>The Government also introduced legislation to reform local government in 2001. Some changes were implemented in 2002: as of 6 March, the (newly elected) municipal councils were separated from the municipal executive. Aldermen would no longer be members of the council and need not be elected by the people. A mayor would still be appointed by the Crown (i.e., the Minister of Home Affairs), but the municipal government was allowed to nominate two candidates and give citizens a choice between the candidates in a (consultative) referendum. However, when implemented, this procedure did not please either conservatives or reformers. In December, the acting government decided to return to the old procedure of appointment without referendum and without multiple nominations from the municipal council. At the same time, it prepared a constitutional amendment that would allow direct election of mayors.</p>

            <p>In January 2002, Parliament approved a proposal to raise once again the subsidies for political parties. The parties would be entitled to roughly 9 million euros (20 million guilders); in 2001 they had received 15 million guilders (6.8 million euros). In December, Minister of Home Affairs Remkes urged the parties to publish donations and sponsorships they received before the elections of 22 January 2003, but not all parties complied with his request.</p>
