<section class="article-section article-section__full"><section class="article-section__content" id="ss1"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss1-title"> Results of the general election and issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The first three opinion polls of the year gave Labour an average of 38 per cent, the Conservatives 32 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 21 per cent. Although a general election was not constitutionally required until June 2006, with disadvantageous constituency boundary changes expected to be in place then and the demands of the European Union (EU) presidency and G8 summit in the second half of 2005, a general election in the early summer was widely expected. Even though the election was not formally announced until 5 April, the first four months of 2005 had the character of a long campaign with a string of policy announcements.</p>
         
         <p>The Labour campaign attempted to avoid questions on Iraq and concentrate on improvements to public services and persistent economic growth and stability. This was not, however, completely solid ground for Labour; it was commonly argued that the expansion of public spending had (particularly in health) failed to produce sufficient improvements. In his pre‐election budget, Chancellor Gordon Brown outlined further financial support packages for pensioners, first‐time home buyers and working families. Other Labour manifesto pledges included the introduction of identity cards; further restructuring of the health and education systems to introduce more private‐sector provision and consumer choice; and extending paid maternity leave and childcare availability.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservative campaign appeared to focus on immigration and asylum, which at the time of the election came top of the list of public concerns in surveys (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Clarke et al. 2005</a></span>). The Conservatives proposed introducing an Australian‐style quota system for immigration and a work permit plan aimed at avoiding upgrade to permanent residency; after the election, Labour published plans for a points‐based system that is effectively similar to the <i>status quo</i>. The Tories also said they would only admit a fixed number of asylum seekers each year – a policy that they acknowledged would require the United Kingdom to withdraw from the 1951 United Nations (UN) convention on refugees, and for which they were attacked by both EU and UN officials. The cover of the Conservative manifesto listed six priorities: more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, school discipline, controlled immigration and accountability. Other pledges included cutting council tax for the over‐65s; a review of the national curriculum to ‘root out’ political correctness; increases in the family tax credits; staying out of the Euro; and campaigning against the European Constitution. The traditional conflict over taxation and spending was partly neutralized by Labour's promise not to raise the basic or top rate of income tax, and the Tories' promise to match Labour's planned spending increases in health and education and to cut taxes by making greater efficiency savings (published in the James review) than those in the Government‐commissioned Gershon review.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Liberal Democrats dubbed themselves the ‘Real Alternative’ to emphasize how they provided stronger opposition than the Conservatives to several controversial planks of Government policy, most notably the Iraq War. The ten ‘Reasons to Vote Liberal Democrat’ included free personal care for the elderly; cleaner transport and energy; reduced class sizes; an extra £100 a month for over‐75s; a 50 per cent income tax rate for those earning over £100,000; and replacing the council (property) tax with a local income tax. Just as Labour remained committed to joining the Euro and the European Constitution subject to referenda, so too did the Liberal Democrats, but with more enthusiasm.</p>
         
         <p>Inevitably the Iraq War was a major campaign issue with public debate touching on the reasons for and legality of the war; the veracity of intelligence published by the Government; the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British and American soldiers; the continued insurgency; and future prospects. After several months of resistance, the Government was forced by newspaper leaks two weeks before the election to publish the Attorney General's advice of 7 and 17 March 2003; both statements came to the view that the Iraq War was legal, but while the former clearly shows doubt about the strength of the legal case for war based on UN resolution 1441 (without a second resolution), the latter is short and unequivocal despite no apparent legal basis for a change of opinion. Five days before the election, <i>The Sunday Times</i> claimed that it had documents showing that Blair had agreed with George W. Bush to support a war in Iraq as early as October 2002.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 5 May 2005, Labour was returned to power for the third time in a row (unprecedented for the party) with their majority reduced from 165 to 66 (about average for postwar governments). However, their share of the vote (35.2 per cent) had never before delivered an overall majority to any party in the United Kingdom, despite the tendency of single‐member plurality electoral systems to manufacture majorities for the largest party. Moreover, the drop in the share of the vote (of 8 per cent since 1997) was the largest ever for a Labour government during their period of office. Labour losses were heaviest in areas with large Muslim and student populations, suggesting the importance of the Iraq War and higher education top‐up fees to these groups. Despite the introduction of a ban on hunting with hounds in February, there was little sign of a disproportionate countryside swing against Labour, perhaps because this had already happened in 2001. Thanks to the bias in the electoral system (which would still have delivered an overall majority of 22 for Labour even if both Labour and the Conservatives had won the same share of the vote), the electorate managed to punish Labour without replacing them with the Tories.</p>
         
         <p>The Conservative recovery was minimal (+0.7 per cent and +32 seats) and for the most part restricted to the southeast of England, perhaps because of the relatively poor performance of the economy there. While the British Election Study (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Clarke et al. 2005</a></span>) suggests people were much less likely to dislike the party than they were in 1997 or 2001 (<span title=""><a href="#b7" id="#b7R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fisher &amp; Curtice 2005</a></span>), without an agreed strategy or a vision for the country, the Tories seem to have failed to reach out to new sections of the electorate.
         </p>
         
         <p>Unusually following a period of Labour government, the chief beneficiaries were the Liberal Democrats, with a +3.8 point rise. This only produced a net gain of ten seats because there were few Labour‐Liberal Democrat marginal constituencies, and Liberal Democrat support actually fell in Conservative‐Liberal Democrat marginals. The minor parties collectively achieved their largest share of the vote (10.4 per cent) and share of seats (4.8 per cent) since 1918 by both contesting more seats and increasing their share of the vote in the seats contested. Notable performances include the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP), although they were way down on their 2004 European Parliament elections performance; the far‐right British National Party (BNP); the Green Party; and the anti Iraq‐War Respect coalition, whose controversial leader, George Galloway, won a seat. Together they account for over half the minor party share in Britain, while the Scottish and Welsh nationalists account for just over a quarter. With the exception of the BNP, these parties do not appear to have mobilized new voters, but instead drew support from people who would otherwise have voted for one of the major parties by emphasizing particular issues. Turnout, at 61.4 per cent, although up on the 2001 figure of 59.4 per cent, was a long way below the previous postwar low of 71.4 per cent in 1997, despite a trebling of the proportion of the electorate issued with postal votes (to 12.1 per cent).</p>
         
         <p>The rise of third parties produced the lowest combined share of the vote (67.6 per cent) and share of seats (85.7 per cent) for the Conservatives and Labour since 1923, and the greatest fragmentation since the restructuring of the party system (from a Conservative‐Liberal to a Conservative‐Labour dominated one) after the First World War. One consequence is that there is now a wide range of results – anything between a 1 and 11.8 point Conservative lead – that would produce a hung Parliament at the next election (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Curtice et al. 2005</a></span>). The House of Commons also has marginally more female and ethnic minority MPs than ever before (128 and 14, respectively, out of 646).
         </p>
         
         <p>The election was tough on the party leaders. Tony Blair almost immediately received accusations of blame for Labour's poor performance and calls for his resignation from within the party, supported by polls indicating that the decisive factor separating Labour from Liberal Democrat supporters was trust in the Prime Minister. However, in July and August, Blair received a brief surge in popularity after the G8 reached an agreement on African debt relief, and London won the right to stage the 2012 Olympics. By the time of the party conferences in September there was renewed speculation as to when Blair would step down in favour of Brown. In the run up to the election Blair seemed to have been forced to placate Brown, but they managed to establish a good public working relationship for the campaign, with Blair announcing Brown was his favoured successor the week before the election. For his part, Brown tried to smooth the transition by announcing he would maintain Labour's modernizing agenda if he became prime minister. However, Blair's conference speech, in line with his October 2004 declared intention to serve a ‘full third term’, emphasized how much he still wanted to do.</p>
         
         <p>On the morning after the election, Michael Howard announced that he would step down after revision of the leadership election rules; the system, in which party members choose between two candidates selected by Conservative MPs, had produced only unsuccessful right‐wing leaders (William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith), while Howard himself was unchallenged. However, party activists failed to provide the two‐thirds majority required to give Conservative MPs the final say. After a poor speech at the party conference in October, the fortunes of the relatively right‐wing clear frontrunner, David Davis, turned, while the 39 year‐old Eton‐ and Oxford‐educated modernizer, David Cameron, gained momentum. Despite failing to deny that he had previously used cocaine, Cameron won the second round of the Conservative MPs' election with 90 votes (to Davis' 57 and Fox's 51) in October, and was elected as the fifth Conservative Party leader in nine years by 134,446 votes to 64,398 (for Davis) on 6 December. The most moderate and electable candidate had, for the first time, been successful under the apparently flawed system, perhaps reflecting greater desire for power among the membership. After cycling to work, Cameron's acceptance speech called for both new roads and targets for reducing carbon emissions; a ‘modern compassionate Conservativism’; more women Conservative MPs; ‘Punch and Judy politics’ to be replaced with a more consensual style; reformed and improved public services; and a liberated voluntary sector. In his campaign, he promised to withdraw Conservative MEPs from the ‘federalist’ European Peoples Party; reverse the party's opposition to higher education top‐up fees; prioritize the maintenance of economic growth over cutting taxes; share the proceeds of growth between improving public services and cutting taxes; simplify the tax and benefit system (while close colleague and Shadow Chancellor, George Osborne, flirted with a flat tax); and choose policies primarily according to their effects on the poorest.</p>
         
         <p>The apparent rejuvenation of the Conservative Party under David Cameron, and his provocative christening of the Tories as the ‘Liberal Alternative’, contributed to the pressure put on Charles Kennedy within the Liberal Democrats. Despite a record electoral performance, many thought Kennedy failed to capitalize sufficiently on the fortuitous political circumstances created by the support of both Labour and Conservatives for the unpopular Iraq War: he was forced to resign in January 2006.</p>
         
         <p>In Northern Ireland, the pro‐agreement Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost five of their six seats in the general election, including that of their Nobel Peace Prize winning leader, David Trimble. The election firmly established the anti‐agreement Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the republican Sinn Féin Party (i.e., the more hard‐line parties) as predominant in the unionist and nationalist communities respectively.</p>
         
         <p>On 7 July four suicide bombings on London's public transport system killed 56 people (including the bombers) and injured an estimated 700. The bombs were coordinated by young Muslim men who were British born and/or resident. Al‐Qaeda claimed responsibility for what was the largest single terrorist attack in Britain since the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 and the first suicide bombings in Western Europe. Two weeks later, after four failed copy‐cat bombings, an innocent Brazilian electrician, Jean Charles de Menezes, was mistakenly shot dead by police, who came under severe criticism for both the errors in the operation and their handling of the aftermath.</p>
         
         <p>The incident also highlighted tensions between the goals of liberty and security. Cross‐party talks on anti‐terror legislation eventually broke down and aspects of the Government's proposals were challenged in both the Lords and the Commons, especially detention without trial for which the Government were forced to accept a 28 (instead of 90) day limit. This and other votes showed that the new parliamentary arithmetic (entailed by a Government majority of 66) had both failed to instil discipline among Labour MPs and apparently encouraged the Lords to be more obstructive. In truth, however, the Government previously had been engaged in protracted battles with the Lords in March over provisions for house arrest in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was introduced following the Law Lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights.</p>
         
         <p>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) announced disarmament on 28 July, and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning confirmed that arms had been put beyond use on 28 September. These events gave opportunity for Sinn Féin to pressure the DUP to restore power sharing under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Although the DUP argued that republican paramilitaries were still engaged in criminal activity and not yet committed to peace, the Government published proposals to indemnify anyone (including paramilitaries, policemen and soldiers) who had committed a crime related to the political situation since 1968. These ‘on the run’ proposals were dropped at the start of 2006, but not before the details managed to flare tempers on all sides; most notably there were widespread riots over three nights in September in various loyalist areas. On 19 December, Sinn Féin expelled three party members on charges of spying that (ironically) were identified as a result of the police raid on Sinn Féin's Stormont offices in 2002 in response to allegations of republican spying on the Government, and which brought down the power‐sharing agreement that has yet to be re‐established.</p>
         
         <p>After the French and Dutch referenda, the United Kingdom suspended their referendum on the Constitution for Europe, which would most likely have also produced a negative result. Prime Minister Blair managed to successfully defend the British rebate (a highly symbolic part of the EU budget originally secured by Margaret Thatcher) from attack in June, but was eventually forced to make concessions (of £1 billion a year rising to £1.9 billion) to secure a budget agreement in December. Inevitably, Eurosceptics in Britain accused Blair of giving away something for nothing.</p>
         
         <p>After protracted legal and political wrangling, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles (a divorcee) in a civil ceremony in Windsor Guildhall, which was followed by a church blessing in the castle. Single‐sex couples started taking advantage of the new civil partnership scheme (dubbed ‘gay marriage’) in mid‐December. New rules allowing pubs in England and Wales to open later than 11 pm came into force in late November without incident. Whereas opinion polls between May and November all showed a Labour lead, five of the eight polls in December put the Conservatives ahead by an average of just over 1 point.</p>

         <p>In a by‐election on 14 July, Mark Hunter held the Cheadle constituency for the Liberal Democrats following the death of Patsy Calton. Following the death while hill‐walking of former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who resigned from the government over the Iraq War, Labour's Jim Devine held the Livingston constituency in a by‐election on 29 September.</p>

         <p>The Freedom of Information Act (2000) came into force on 1 January 2005. This provides a right of access to information from public authorities, but with a large list of exemptions (including information related to the economic and security interests of the United Kingdom) making the right to information quite limited in practice. A request for the Attorney General's advice on the legality of the Iraq War was denied on 3 January. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, David McLetchie MSP, was forced to resign (to be replaced by Annabel Goldie) after details of his £11,500 taxi expenses were released under separate, and more liberal, Scottish Freedom of Information laws.</p>
         
         <p>The House of Commons voted to partially reverse its 2002 decision to change its sittings to end at 7 pm rather than 10 pm on some days. This was seen as retrograde by many and prompted one female MP to stand down at the election.</p>
