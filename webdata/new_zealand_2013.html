         <p>It was a tumultuous and colourful year in New Zealand politics, littered with downfalls and failures. At the end of the year, one leading newspaper political editor, Fairfax's Tracy Watkins, said that ‘if 2013 should be known as anything, it is the year of the fiasco – of which there were many’. A large number of New Zealand politicians and other public figures suffered embarrassments and scandals. There were also plenty of policy failures and challenges for the ruling National Party. Nonetheless, the government continued to do very well in opinion polls – partly a reflection of the skills of Prime Minister John Key, the recovering economy and some rejuvenation in the National Party. In contrast, the National Party's support partners – the Maori Party, United Future and the Act Party – all suffered a very difficult year, beset with damaging internal issues. The main opposition party, Labour, also struggled for most of the year, but ended up changing its leader and looking much stronger by the end of the year. While all of this occurred, the unusual main political theme running through the year was of various controversies about spying and privacy.</p>

            <p>A Citizens' Initiated Referendum took place in November and December after being triggered by more than 10 per cent of enrolled voters signing a petition against the partial privatisation programme of the National government. The referendum took the form of a postal vote, and asked the question: ‘Do you support the Government selling up to 49% of Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power, Genesis Power, Solid Energy and Air New Zealand?’ Two thirds of voters participating in the referendum voted against the partial privatisation programme. The referendum was not binding, and the government took very little notice of it.</p>
            
            <p>The assets sales programme was indeed highly unpopular, but the low turnout for the referendum (45 per cent of enrolled voters) indicated that opposition was not as strongly felt as the government's opponents believed. The low voter turnout was also due partly to the fact that the privatisation programme was already in motion, with assets already partly sold. The government had, however, hoped that more support would be forthcoming for the sales once the success of them was apparent. Unfortunately, the sales programme was largely a flop, with the floatation of the companies on the share market not bringing in the revenue that was forecast. Enthusiasm for buying the energy company shares was also hampered by the opposition parties of Labour and the Greens announcing that a future government would introduce a major reform to the electricity market, potentially reducing the profits of these energy‐generating companies.</p>

         <p>The National government was focused on rejuvenating itself during 2013, leading to a number of retirement announcements. Very early in the year, Prime Minister Key carried out a cabinet reshuffle in which two ministers were asked to relinquish their positions, which was widely understood to be due to under‐performance. Kate Wilkinson, the Minister of Conservation and Food Safety, as well as Phil Heatley, who had the portfolios for Housing and Energy and Resources, left the cabinet and later announced they would leave politics at the next election. David Carter, the Minister for Primary Industries, also left the cabinet to become the new Speaker of the House in Parliament, replacing Lockwood Smith who departed to become High Commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom. The three new cabinet ministers were Simon Bridges, Nikki Kaye and Nick Smith.</p>
         
         <p>New Zealand has an unusual arrangement of having a small number of ‘ministers outside of cabinet’. While these junior ministers are not included in the cabinet, in constitutional terms they are part of the executive. In 2013 two ministers outside of cabinet were fired by the Prime Minister due to their roles in controversies. Neither minister was from the National Party – both were leaders of political parties that were ‘support partners’ in coalition with the National Party. The first to go, in June, was Peter Dunne, the Minister of Revenue and leader of the United Future Party. Then in October, John Banks, leader of the Act Party, who was Minister of Regulatory Reform and Minister for Small Business, resigned when he was ordered to stand trial over allegations that he had filed a false electoral donations return for a previous mayoral campaign bid. Both departures are dealt with below.</p>

         <p>The Labour Party changed its leader after David Shearer, who had been in the position for two years, failed to make an impact on support for the party. Labour had recently adopted new leadership selection rules. Previously only the caucus could vote on the leadership. New rules gave the caucus only 40 per cent of the aggregate vote, the membership 40 per cent and the affiliated unions the other 20 per cent. David Cunliffe emerged as the very clear victor, although one of his opponents, Grant Robertson, won a majority of the votes in caucus. Cunliffe, who had been a minister in the previous Labour government, was highly popular among the membership and unions. His victory was particularly impressive because he had recently been exiled to the backbenches of parliament and his future in the party had been in doubt.</p>
         
         <p>Other parties changed leaders, too. The Maori Party has a co‐leadership of a male and female leader in a caucus of only three. Both co‐leaders announced that they would leave parliament at the next election, prompting speculation about who would replace them. The male co‐leader, and government minister, Pita Sharples, eventually decided to stand down as co‐leader to be replaced by the party's third MP Te Ururoa Flavell.</p>
         
         <p>The Act Party only had one MP in parliament – leader John Banks, who lost his ministerial warrant in October when he was ordered to face a judicial trial over allegations that he had falsified an official declaration about the donations that he had received when previously campaigning to become the mayor of Auckland. Banks indicated that he would not stand for parliament again and that he would relinquish the leadership of the party early in the following year.</p>
         
         <p>The New Zealand First party finally selected a deputy leader after being without one for many years. MP Tracey Martin took on the role after a caucus vote in October.</p>

         <p>The state's two intelligence gathering agencies – the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) and the State Intelligence Security (SIS) – were frequently part of political debate throughout the year. These normally very low‐key agencies became enmeshed in various controversies. The GCSB, in particular, suffered a blow to its reputation with the revelation that it had illegally spied on a controversial German national in New Zealand, Kim Dotcom. A subsequent report into the agency's operations, which was initiated by the government, found that the agency appeared to have illegally spied on up to 88 people in New Zealand. As a result of this scandal, the GCSB was subjected to a considerable restructuring, including resignations. Further scandal eventuated, including questions about how the Prime Minister had come to employ an old school friend as its head.</p>
         
         <p>Many further inquiries took place. The ‘Henry inquiry’ was initiated to investigate how the initial inquiry had come to be leaked to a journalist. The report from this led to the sacking of a minister from outside of cabinet, Peter Dunne, leader of the United Future Party. He maintained his innocence, but had refused to cooperate fully with the inquiry, which led the Prime Minister to lose confidence in him. A further inquiry was established to investigate the revelation that the Henry inquiry had improperly accessed the private details of the parliamentary journalist in question. This led to the resignation of the head of the Parliamentary Service.</p>
         
         <p>The government received a lot of criticism for its handling of a decision to build a convention centre in Auckland. The contract for building and operating the centre was put out to public tender, but the government negotiated an unusual deal with the operator of the SkyCity Casino. In return for building and operating a convention centre, the casino would be given some important concessions in terms of its casino contract. Legislation was passed to make it happen, which was vociferously opposed by opposition parties, who labelled the deal ‘crony capitalism’. The deal‐making was also criticised by the Auditor‐General.</p>
         
         <p>The New Zealand economy improved in 2013, allowing the government to highlight a reduction in unemployment and a higher growth rate. The government's annual budget forecasted that there would be a return to surplus in the books the following year. One international economist was widely quoted as referring to the economy as a ‘rock star’ within the developed world. The opposition parties pointed out, however, that much of the improved performance was due to factors outside of the government's control, such as the massive post‐earthquake rebuilding of Christchurch city and the increasing global commodity prices for New Zealand exports. The opposition also focused attention on very poor statistics for youth unemployment, inequality and child poverty.</p>
         
         <p>The economic base of the country was briefly feared for when the main dairy exporting company, Fonterra, faced a botulism scare. For a period, New Zealand dairy products were withdrawn from sale in more than seven countries, including China, but subsequent testing cleared all products of harmful bacteria.</p>
         
         <p>Offsetting the generally good economic news, rising house prices became a much greater political concern, especially in terms of housing affordability in Auckland. The National government's main solution lay in attempting to free up land for development. The Reserve Bank also intervened by forcing banks to require higher deposits for house buying.</p>
         
         <p>Perhaps the most historic political debate and decision was about same‐sex marriage. The Marriage Equality bill, introduced by Labour MP Louisa Wall, was passed by a clear majority of MPs, including the Prime Minister. The Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson created a particularly global stir with his ‘gay rainbow’ speech in favour of the legislation, which quickly achieved 1.5 million views on YouTube.</p>
