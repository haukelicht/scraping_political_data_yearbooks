         <p>The last full year of the government's term consisted of some political success in terms of carrying the marriage equality referendum and the normalisation of budgetary politics away from strict austerity. With Irish growth at the highest level in the Eurozone and unemployment continuing to decline, there was some speculation that the government would call an early election in late 2015. This did not happen, but the latter half of the year saw all parties effectively campaigning as if there was an election. This was hardly surprising given that the election had to be called in early 2016. However, the government also came under serious criticism for being seen as too politically close to a billionaire businessman, which the opposition claimed resulted in companies owned by this individual successfully bidding to acquire state contracts for services. Moreover, the impressive macroeconomic growth figures were not affecting everyone equally.</p>

            <p>The by‐election to fill the seat of Phil Hogan was held in conjunction with two referendums on 23 May 2015. Hogan resigned from the Dáil in 2014 to take up the post of European Union Agriculture Commissioner. In addition to being a Fine Gael TD, he was also Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the Kenny I cabinet. Fine Gael failed to retain the seat which was won by Fianna Fáil's Bobby Aylward, who had lost his seat in 2011. This pointed to a recovery in support for Fianna Fáil after their bad result in the 2011 general election and the subsequent by‐elections.</p>

            <p>The most significant national poll of 2015 was the same‐sex marriage referendum. The programme for government agreed in 2011 proposed to put a number of issues to a Constitutional Convention (see Courtney &amp; O'Malley <span title=""><a href="#epdy12127-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12127-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2014</a></span>). This was suggested in part because the parties could not agree a position on some constitutional issues (O'Malley <span title=""><a href="#epdy12127-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12127-bib-0007R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). One of those issues was same‐sex marriage, which the convention ultimately supported. Fine Gael, which has a conservative wing to the party, was reluctant to commit to a referendum on the issue – it was not clear that the Irish Constitution required a referendum – but the cautious nature of politicians on the issue of same sex marriage meant it was deemed politically necessary. Such a referendum served three purposes. First, it prevented any challenge in the courts to the legislation, which may have been easily upheld, in turn striking down the measure. Second, holding a popular vote on the issue deflected responsibility for the outcome away from the leadership of the larger party in government, Fine Gael, whose supporters included a great many people opposed to the idea of same‐sex marriage. Finally, it allowed the junior coalition partner, the Labour Party, to claim that it had delivered on a significant manifesto pledge. This was important because the party had been perceived by some of its supporters as too comfortable with austerity and Fine Gael's agenda in government.

            <p>The proposal passed following a vigorous campaign and a drive by many pro‐amendment activists to encourage people who had emigrated in recent years to come ‘home to vote’ (the dubious legality of which went unquestioned). Opposition to the amendment was framed in terms of the effects on children of being denied a ‘normal’ family unit by people in gay marriages who might adopt children from third parties or have children themselves through surrogacy.</p>

            <p>Also emerging from the Constitutional Convention was a proposal to amend the eligibility criteria for the presidency. Like many democracies, the age eligibility for candidacy as head of state is higher than that for the national parliament. In Ireland, the age is 35 as opposed to 21 for the parliament. The government framed this proposal as an equality measure, arguing that younger citizens should not be disbarred from putting themselves forward for presidential office. Realistically, this was an attempt by the government to notch up an easy win on their political reform scorecard, which was coming up a bit short in their last year of office following the failed referendum to abolish the Seanad. The public was not enamoured with the idea of a 30 year‐old former president receiving a presidential pension for the rest of their life. Moreover, it was noted that there is no demand from young people for this change as the youngest candidate in the most recent presidential election in 2011 was 47. Occurring on the same day as the marriage equality referendum meant that this proposal was given much less attention, as happens when more than one proposal is put to a public vote. In this case, the public voted against this change and the age criterion remains at 35.</p>

         <p>Two new political parties emerged in 2015. Renua Ireland (whose name sounds Gaelic but is a neologism) was founded by three former Fine Gael TDs who left the party because of its support for anti‐abortion legislation. Those who voted against their party (in local parlance ʻlost the party whipʼ) and followed Lucinda Creigton (a former junior minister for Europe) in forming a group with a placeholder title of Reform Alliance. The new group was launched as Reboot Ireland in January, and then Renua in March. The party could comfortably fit into Fine Gael in policy terms, but claimed to differ in its approach to politics, favouring more internal democracy and a relaxed use of the whip. It suffered from having just one well‐known member, as other members failed to receive much positive attention.</p>
         
         <p>Another party, the Social Democrats, was founded in July by three other independent TDs, two of whom had been elected as independents, and a third, Roisin Shorthall, who had resigned as junior minister for Health and the Labour Party whip in 2012 over relations with her senior minister. The party refused to appoint a single leader, and like Renua, it emphasised its committment to internal party democracy.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="epdy12127-sec-0090"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12127-sec-0090-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The continued strong economic growth came as a relief for the incumbent Fine Gael and Labour coalition government. It had implemented severe austerity measures for the previous four budgets, often breaking promises made at the 2011 election. In the budget announced in 2015, tax rates were reduced (to take effect in 2016) and targeted especially at low and middle income earners.</p>
         
         <p>Money was also returned by way of welfare payments. While many welfare provisions, such as unemployment assistance, were protected in the austerity years, some universal payments such as old age pensions and child benefit were cut. The budget reversed some of those cuts. In total, spending was increased by about €1.5 billion. Despite the increased spending and tax cuts, the deficit was reduced to below 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in line with Eurozone rules. The debt‐to‐GDP ratio continued to fall and the tax take outperformed expectations. However there were some concerns that much of this was based on high exports from the multinational sector, and so neither wholly sustainable nor reflective of changes in the ‘real’ economy. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was concerned that the government was once again engaging in pro‐cyclical policies – putting money into a growing economy. Given all the country had been through, and the upcoming election, it would have been difficult for any government to resist this temptation. The speculation of a November election drew the attention of journalists and commentators for weeks, and a trend toward Fine Gael was thought to have tempted it, but Labour was hoping to squeeze every last drop out of the recovery and preferred to wait until after the budget took effect in January 2016. As the government was going to the country on the basis of returning a stable government, Fine Gael thought better of causing a split on this issue.</p>
         
         <p>There were signs that the so‐called ‘real’ economy was picking up. Retail sales grew, as did employment. Opposition parties that had spent years complaining about the austerity measures shifted their focus on to the type of recovery. There were undoubtedly still problems in the Irish economy and the social impacts of the recession continued to be felt. Thus opposition parties made an issue of a two‐tiered recovery in which improvement was not felt outside Dublin or among the working class. The truth of these charges was hard to gauge, but continued protests on water charges showed that there remained a deep antipathy among some toward the government parties.</p>
         
         <p>The economic recovery also put some pressure on the government to restore public sector pay. Public servants had taken large pay cuts during the crisis with the vague promise that pay would be restored once the public sector finances could manage it. The government agreed a pay restoration plan with public sector unions, but in October the members of unions representing police and nurses rejected the deals, leaving open the possibility of industrial action. Part of the problem was that new (usually younger) entrants to these professions were on a different (lower) pay scale than the cohort who entered before the crisis.</p>
         
         <p>The younger generations were also having to deal with the increasing difficulty of securing a home. Rents in Dublin recorded double‐digit growth in the year, and new rules in mortgage lending made it more difficult to get a mortgage that would buy a house in the city. Many in rental accommodation struggled to pay the rents, and there was an increase in homelessness reported by housing charities. There were calls for rent controls and increases to rent supplements, both of which the government resisted, but there was an attempt to cap rent increases, which seemed to only increase rents more quickly as landlords sought to evade any new rules. Little was done on the supply of new housing, in part because existing homeowners and politicians opposed major housing developments in their own constituencies.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the year a controversy slowly built up regarding the sale of the insolvent building infrastructure company Siteserv, which the state had acquired as a result of earlier bail‐out legislation. The sale of Siteserv to Millington, an Isle of Man‐registered company with links to a billionaire businessman Denis O'Brien, received little attention in 2012 when it went through. O'Brien had connections to Fine Gael, and a Tribunal of Inquiry into another government decision found him to have benefited from a corrupt transaction (a charge he rejected). It emerged that Millington had not been the highest bidder, though the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), the state‐owned bad bank that sold the company, claims it did so for sound commercial reasons. The government was dismissive of parliamentary questions on the issue, but further attention eventually led it to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to assess the sale. The government's handling of the controversy damaged trust in it, and it was further damaged when it became public that Siteserv had subsequently been awarded a government contract for the installation of water meters in the country.</p>
