         <p>A total of 12 candidates ran for the presidency; three (O. Besancenot, A. Laguiller and G. Schivardi) represented the different factions of the French Trotskyite tradition. J. Bové competed under the banner of the anti‐globalisation movement. M.J. Buffet was the candidate of the Communist Party. D. Voynet entered the race for the Greens. P. deVilliers, a dissent UMP candidate represented the anti‐ European sovereignists. C. Lepage, an independent Ecologist, and F. Nihous, candidate for the movement Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition closed the list of the so‐called ‘little’ candidates who, according to their place in the political system and pre‐election surveys, entered the race with no chance of winning. The main contenders, then, were N. Sarkozy for the Union for a Popular Majority (UMP), S. Royal for the Socialist Party (PS), F. Bayrou for The Union for French Democracy (UDF) and J.M. Le Pen for the National Front (FN).</p>

         <p>The oldest candidate – in terms of both age and number of candidacies (i.e., five), J.M. Le Pen, campaigned on his traditional credo: anti‐immigration and anti‐Europeanism, and fears about the future of a ‘French identity’ threatened by globalisation. However, his position appeared to be less secure than in 2002 when he had qualified for the runoff. He was challenged by N. Sarkozy. The rightist candidate, as he had done as Minister of Home Affairs, exploited some of the far right's themes: immigration, crime and violence, links between immigration and national identity. However, the UMP leader, who once called the French social model a sham, emphasised the need to break from the old way of doing things backed by both the left and right and to move to a new set of values. This change concerned the economic and social domains, with an appeal for more liberalism and a modernisation of French economic and social rules that were supposedly paralysing the country and limiting its clout in Europe and the rest of the world. Yet the change also had a cultural tone, as witnessed by the controversy over the spirit and events of May 1968. Economic liberalism was associated with anti‐libertarian stands: work against leisure, family against pleasure, national pride against perpetual regret over some parts of our history like slavery and colonisation. However, throughout the campaign, the UMP candidate appeared to be very dynamic and firm.</p>
         
         <p>F. Bayrou, the UDF contender, focused his campaign less on a precise programme than on the way the Fifth Republic has malfunctioned. The French want to be respected and considered, but they did not feel that respect from the ‘system’– the sterile alternation in power of the UMP and the PS that has left no place for a real political debate and under which France's principal economic problems remain unresolved. Therefore, the UDF leader asked the voters to back a strong and independent centre able to promote a third alternative both in the political and economic domains. However, the candidate did not explain what type of alliances and coalitions he would promote in the case of his victory.</p>

         <p>According to pre‐election surveys, S. Royal led the race until the official candidacy of N. Sarkozy (14 January). However, she was quickly overtaken. Her campaign appeared to be erratic, veering between different lines. Globally speaking, she wanted to maintain her independence and her personal views in the economic and social domains and at the level of values, which were more conservative than those backed by the party (immigration, law and order, national pride, etc.). At the same time, however, the party attempted to control her campaign or to support stands that were more in line with the traditional French socialist credo. Consequently, there were big contradictions both between the party and its candidate and in the candidate's own mind. Moreover, she appeared not to be well prepared for the job.</p>
         
         <p>As proved by the high level of turnout (83.8 per cent for the first ballot and 84.0 per cent in the second), the campaign was interesting. Contrary to the 2002 election, the mainstream candidates presented the electorate with very different political projects and offered it a real choice. It was also true that change, the keynote of the campaign, was emphasised by a new political generation that turned an historic page. N. Sarkozy appeared to be the main victor of the first round. First, his score (31.2 per cent of the valid votes) was some way above those of J. Chirac in 1981, 1988, 1995 and 2002. Second, his strategy of moving to more conservative values and policies was successful. He succeeded in limiting the extreme right's influence: for the first time since 1998, Le Pen's score decreased (10.4 per cent as against 16.9 in 2002). However, the most striking event was the ‘success’ of F. Bayrou. True, the UDF president did not make it into the second ballot, but he gained 18.6 per cent of the vote compared to his 6.8 per cent in 2002. He benefited from a centrist and anti‐UMP electorate, which supported his anti‐system stands; but he was also backed by some Socialist sympathisers, either because they lacked confidence in the PS candidate or because they wanted F. Bayrou to run in the second ballot and defeat N. Sarkozy (as forecast by all surveys). Royal's share of the votes (25.9 per cent) appeared to be just acceptable inasmuch as she improved on Jospin's share of the electorate in 2002 (16.2 per cent). However, the overall score of the left‐wing bloc was very low (36.4 per cent). Socialist dominance was confirmed, but the far left and, moreover, the Communist Party and the Greens achieved very poor results.</p>
         
         <p>In order to win the second ballot, S. Royal had to broaden her support by an appeal to centrist voters. Despite a courteous television debate between S. Royal and F. Bayrou, it was clear that the latter would maintain his refusal to endorse either the PS or the UMP and leave his voters free to choose between them. The situation was made more complicated when a large number of the UDF's elected officials chose to rally round N. Sarkozy, to quit the UDF and to run at the next elections under the label New Centre. According to the post‐election surveys, they were followed by 50 per cent of the Bayrou's backers and N. Sarkozy won the race.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The general election and issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>As is Fifth Republic tradition, once he was in the Elysée Palace, N. Sarkozy appointed on May 17 and May 18 a Prime Minister and a cabinet not only to prepare for the legislative elections of 10 and 17 June, but also to implement the policies outlined during the electoral campaign. The Government had many novel characteristics. First it was formed of only 20 members (16 ministers and 4 junior ministers) with traditional posts folded into large ministries with multiple competences. Second, for the first time in French history, it included almost as many women as men. Third, a woman, a young lawyer and the daughter of North African immigrants would head the prestigious, but difficult, Justice Ministry. Last but not least, the team was carefully calibrated with a majority of UMP loyalists, a few members from the New Centre, some people who were close to the president but did not belong to the UMP, and three people who (even if they were marginal rather than leading actors in the PS or had recently been expelled from its ranks) were from the left. It was false to speak of a policy of conciliation since there was no bargain with the PS and since the three had to support Sarkozy's policies. Nevertheless, the appointments unsettled the PS and its electorate.</p>
         
         <p>The electoral campaign was brief and focused on the topics at stake during the presidential campaign (violence and crime, immigration and national identity, economic and social reforms). However a new issue was emphasised: the protection of the environment and sustainable development. On the other hand, in the last days before the first ballot and in the week before the second ballot, the campaign turned into a broad controversy about the Government's tax plans. N. Sarkozy and F. Fillon argued that a cut in taxes (a limit of 50 per cent of total salary; a drop in death duties) would spur growth; the left‐wing parties stressed that this would simply give a gift to the already privileged. When the President raised the possibility of a ‘social VAT’ in order to lighten the burden on companies and keep jobs in France, many voters – and not only on the left – became very anxious. This explained the relatively strong performance of the left‐wing parties (39 per cent) in the first ballot and their success in the second: in the constituencies where a second ballot took place, they nearly won a majority of the vote (49.4 per cent).</p>
         
         <p>Immediately after the elections, N. Sarkozy appointed a new cabinet, larger then the previous one (33 members) due to the nomination of numerous junior ministers. The balance between men and women was less in favour of the latter (33.3 per cent). The President selected another ex‐PS junior minister and two more junior ministers from immigrant backgrounds. Once in place, the cabinet had to act quickly because ‘nothing would be more perilous for France than to remain immobile’. And since the environment had risen up the President's priority list, the cabinet had to prepare a large conference bringing together parties, unions, nongovernmental associations, deputies and senators.</p>
         
         <p>Some other issues were more controversial. On immigration, the cabinet implemented two policies. On the one hand, the fight against illegal immigrants would be intensified and B. Hortefeux, the Minister of Immigration and National Identity, confirmed that the Government's deportation target would be 25,000 people every year. On the other hand, France would move towards an immigration regime based on the needs of the economy; it would also limit the right of immigrants to bring their families to France and use DNA testing to ensure their links were genuine. At the same time, the Government decided to deprive workers in public transport and public utilities of the ‘special regimes’ that allowed them to retire after only 35.5 years of contributions to their pension funds instead of the normal 40. Those affected organised demonstrations in the streets and the public transport workers went on strike for ten days. However, they got only weak support from the left‐wing parties and not at all from the public, who clearly believed in the principle of equality for all citizens. N. Sarkozy appeared to be victorious and could plan other labour market reforms.</p>
         
         <p>Another topic emerged at the end of the year: the style of the President Sarkozy broke with that of all previous presidents. Young, athletic, dynamic, he wanted to be very active in politics and be the real leader of the government according to his slogan, ‘I have not been elected to do nothing’. He was the first president to decide on all matters, to do so many speeches in so many forums, to travel in so many different countries and to receive so many visitors. He succeeded in changing the traditional balance of power, rendering the Prime Minister either mute or a simple spokesman. At the beginning of his presidency, citizens seemed to agree and to be delighted with the change. However, in the final months of the year, Sarkozy's degree of involvement began to come over as hyperactive. According to open questions in surveys, the president was suspected of acting impulsively. Last but not least, Sarkozy was not helped by his private life: close relationships with some of the country's richest men, a divorce and, in December, a new girlfriend who was formerly a top model. Soon he was being called the ‘bling bling president’. Added to this were policies that divided the voters, fears about the future and about purchasing power (none of which seemed to be on the Government's agenda) and some errors in foreign policy (notably the six‐day visit of President Gadaffi of Libya to France). The President suffered a big drop in popularity. In September, 64 per cent of people interviewed were ‘confident in his ability to handle the most important problems facing France’ (SOFRES); by December the figure had dropped to 49 per cent.</p>
