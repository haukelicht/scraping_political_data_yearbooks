         <p>When the autumn of 2001 passed without a general election being called, it seemed certain that it would not take place until the summer 2002. The Government had been in office for almost five years, making it the second longest ever. It finally called the election for May, just a few weeks short of the last possible date. The campaign itself failed to enliven much interest, perhaps because it had started many months earlier. The shocks came with the results.</p>
         
         <p>Polls and pundits alike predicted a possible overall majority for the main Government party, <i>Fianna Fáil</i>– something not achieved since 1977. The reaction of both Government parties was telling. <i>Fianna Fáil</i> played down the possibility, but indicated that they would form a coalition with the Progressive Democrats (PDs) whether PD support was necessary or not. In contrast, the small neo‐liberal PDs played up the polls’ predictions to relaunch their campaign. In the defining image of the election, Attorney General Michael McDowell was pictured up a telegraph pole in his constituency with a poster proclaiming: ‘One party government? <span style="text-decoration:underline">NO</span> thanks.’ The rest of the campaign was fought on the efficacy of the PDs as a watchdog over <i>Fianna Fáil</i>. Moreover, as there were only three likely government outcomes – a <i>Fianna Fáil</i> single party majority government, the return of the existing coalition or a minority <i>Fianna Fáil</i> government supported by independents – the main opposition party, <i>Fine Gael</i>, effectively ceased to be relevant. Only the minor opposition parties managed to make an impact.
         </p>
         
         <p> <i>Fianna Fáil</i> gained both votes and seats, bringing them a total of 81 TDs (Members of Parliament) – two seats short of an overall majority. The PDs won fewer votes than in 1997 but, because of better vote management and concentration of resources, they managed to double their number of seats. Thus the same government was returned for the first time since 1969.
         </p>
         
         <p>The election was a less happy affair for the established opposition parties. For <i>Fine Gael</i>, the election was a disaster. The party lost 23 seats, winning its lowest share of the seats ever. The relatively new party leader, Michael Noonan, resigned immediately, taking responsibility for results ‘beyond our worst expectations and fears’. To add to its woes, many of the losses were of former cabinet ministers. Its worst performance was in Dublin where it came third in terms of votes and received only three seats, fewer than either the PDs or Green Party. Its best results were in the more rural and least populated constituencies in Connaught and Ulster.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Labour Party refused to rule out coalition with <i>Fianna Fáil</i>, yet its campaign was based on criticism of the Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy's economic philosophy. In the end, Labour managed to retain its seat share, but there was general disappointment that it did not gain ground, especially given <i>Fine Gael</i>'s losses. In the autumn, Ruairí Quinn decided not to stand for re‐election as leader.
         </p>
         
         <p>The micro opposition parties did well in the election. The Green Party finally made a breakthrough, gaining four seats, giving it six in all. <i>Sinn Féin</i>, an all‐Ireland republican party, polled an impressive 6 per cent and took five seats, an increase of four. It was helped by the actions of its paramilitary wing, the IRA, which decommissioned some arms just before the election. Neither party was quite big enough to form a party grouping according to the rules of the <i>Dáil</i> (seven seats are required), but both joined with independents in a pragmatic alliance designed to increase their opportunities to make an impact in Parliament. Independents also did well – taking 13 seats as against six in the previous <i>Dáil</i>.
         </p>
         
         <p>This general election was the first at which campaign spending limits were in place. One defeated candidate challenged the exemption of incumbent TDs’ free materials (such as telephones and postage) from these limits and won in both the High Court and the Supreme Court. This left open the opportunity for a challenge to the results by some defeated candidates.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink"></a><a href="#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>Another change, this one stemming from an earlier legal challenge, was the removal of the requirement to pay a deposit (1381) to stand as a candidate. The Government's solution was to require candidates who are not members of registered political parties to have at least 30 ‘assentors’ from the constituency present themselves at the time of nomination. This may have proved more difficult than raising the deposit as the number of independent candidates fell.</p>
         
         <p>A third phenomenon new to Irish general elections was electronic voting. It was piloted in three constituencies in 2002, with the Government claiming that it would make voting easier and that the count would be both much faster and more accurate. While it certainly improved administration of the count and sped up the process, there were some complaints about the way results were announced, giving the candidates little warning as to how they progressed in each count. It is also a moot point as to whether it made voting easier.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Cabinet and party changes</h2>
         
         <p>Following the election, the re‐elected <i>Taoiseach</i>, Bertie Ahern made what for him was a radical reshuffle. Five ministers left the cabinet (one had lost her seat). Even more than before, neo‐liberal and mildly Eurosceptic politicians occupy the main economic departments of government.
         </p>
         
         <p>As mentioned above, two party leaders resigned or retired in the weeks after the election. Although it could have waited, <i>Fine Gael</i> chose a new leader straight away. As <i>Fine Gael</i> lost so many high‐profile TDs in the election, the list of potential leaders was short. Four candidates stood, and though the results were not released, it was said that Enda Kenny, a former minister, won easily. However, the rejection of the option of election by the full membership caused some annoyance among the rank‐and‐file.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Labour Party's Constitution stipulates that an election involving all members should be held when a leader's term of office is up, unless he or she seeks re‐nomination and there are no other candidates. Quinn decided not to stand for another term and four others entered the contest. This was the first time that an Irish party had elected its leader by a ballot of all the members, and the result was quite unpredictable. The former deputy leader, Brendan Howlin, was the clear favourite, especially given that both of the strongest challengers came from Democratic Left, but opinion polls showed that the Irish electorate in general and Labour voters in particular preferred Pat Rabbitte, a former DL junior minister. This, of course, did not necessarily mean that the Labour Party membership would favour him, but, in the end, of the nearly 4,000 voters (88 per cent of the membership), 1,587 supported Rabbitte as against 1,105 for Howlin. After the elimination of other candidates (through the alternative vote system), Rabbitte finished with 2,128 votes as against Howlin's 1,311.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Referendums</h2>
         
         <p>The electorate was asked to vote on two other issues in 2002, one on either side of the election. The first was a referendum on abortion, to try to resolve a situation that has plagued politicians for decades. It was forced on the Government by independent TDs, who demanded it in part exchange for their long‐term support. This measure was welcomed by most churches in Ireland, but some radical pro‐life (anti‐abortion) groups campaigned against it for potentially allowing some abortions (even though they would only take place to save the life of the mother). They campaigned with the pro‐choice groups, who rejected the amendment as too conservative and may have contributed to the narrow defeat of the measure.</p>
         
         <p>While the first vote did not go unnoticed by the world's press, it was the second referendum, in October, that captured international attention for a few weeks. Having seen the rejection of the Nice Treaty the previous year (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 978–980), the Government had promised to put it to the people again. This time, one of the issues in the previous campaign seemed to be solved. The possibility of Ireland being bound into a mutual defence pact through CFSP (the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy) was ruled out by the Seville Declaration, and by wording the referendum such that it appeared a referendum was required in advance of Ireland joining any defence pact.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Government had also been accused of taking the electorate for granted by not devoting enough energy to the campaign. This was something the Government seemed happy to acknowledge. This time the main parties and social partners spent much more time and money, and the ‘yes’ side was much strengthened by the engagement of private organisations. The ‘yes’ side were worried that, given the Government's unpopularity (a result of sudden, severe cutbacks in public services immediately after the election) and the fact that the Government did not reveal the financial difficulties before the election, the public might use the referendum to punish the Government. Despite these fears, the referendum passed comfortably, perhaps helped by a significantly higher turnout as the total ‘no’ vote was almost unchanged.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>In September, during the Nice Treaty campaign, one of the ongoing tribunals into corruption in the planning process published an interim report that became an unlikely bestseller. The Flood Report said in an unequivocal way that Ray Burke (a minister in the last government) took at least 1280,000 in corrupt payments in the 1980s and had acted in the interests of those making the payments. The scandal put <i>Taoiseach</i> Bertie Ahern under more pressure, as it was known that he was warned about allegations of corruption against Burke, yet still appointed him as Minister for Foreign Affairs in his first Government. Ahern, often characterised as the ‘Teflon <i>Taoiseach</i>’, managed to come out of the scandal relatively unhurt.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Northern Ireland, politics moved frustratingly slowly. The Belfast Agreement seemed close to death on many occasions, but small movements just managed to keep it alive. However, in October, British Secretary of State John Reid suspended the Stormont Assembly with the reluctant agreement of the Irish Government. Although Northern Ireland was rarely a dividing issue in politics of the Republic, it is now even less so.</p>
