         <p>Over the years the Netherlands has traditionally been a warm supporter of European cooperation. However, the beginning of this century saw a groundswell of support for Eurosceptic parties. This growing scepticism was also reflected in the consultative referendum on the draft European Constitution of 1 June 2005 (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Lucardie &amp; Voerman 2006</a></span>: 1201–1203). The ‘Reform Treaty’, which was signed in Lisbon in December 2007, was ratified by the lower house in June 2008 by 111 votes to 39. The Eurosceptic parties had called for another referendum, but to no avail.
         </p>
         
         <p>As a consequence, the Eurosceptic parties tried to turn the European elections into a referendum on the Reform Treaty. The Socialist Party (Socialistische Partij, SP) was opposed to any transfer of national sovereignty from The Hague to Brussels and argued instead for a ‘mini‐treaty’ that would protect the democratic and social interests of citizens and give greater power to national parliaments (and the European Parliament). The right‐wing populist Freedom Party (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) was even more critical of the EU and ran a campaign under the banner ‘For the Netherlands’. In an extremely brief programme (containing just seven items), the party demanded that the Netherlands should not surrender any right of veto, especially on immigration, claiming that ‘the Islamisation of the Netherlands and Europe must be stopped’. The party also wanted to do the following: put an end to The Hague's role as largest net per capita contributor to the EU; prevent Turkey's accession to the EU (‘Turkey never a member of the EU, and that means not in 100 years either’); support the ousting of ‘corrupt states’ like Romania and Bulgaria; and reject the ‘dreadful Treaty of Lisbon’.</p>
         
         <p>At the other end of the spectrum stood D66 (Democraten 66), the champion of European integration in Dutch politics, and Green Left (GroenLinks, GL) with a similarly pro‐European programme. The mainstream parties, the Christian Democrats (Christen Democratisch Appel, CDA), Labour (Partij van de Arbeid, PvdA) and the Liberals (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie, VVD), had adopted something like a Eurorealist position. They remained fundamentally well‐disposed to ‘project Europe’, but the rise of Eurosceptic parties obliged them to place greater emphasis on national sovereignty and on Dutch interests. They became more critical of Brussels' bureaucracy and more cautious about the accession of Turkey, even if they stopped short of rejecting it. This strategy set them apart from D66 and Green Left.</p>
         
         <p>Most parties nominated new leaders to head the lists. Only D66 contested the election with the same person at the helm – Sophie in't Veld. The CDA, PVV and VVD chose national MPs to head their lists. The Christian Democrat Wim van de Camp had served in Parliament since 1986, as had the Liberal Hans van Baalen (also vice‐president of the Liberal International) with a single interruption since 1999. Their national political role meant that they were fairly well known by the electorate: 37 per cent of voters were familiar with Van Baalen and 27 per cent with Van de Camp – many more than with D66 leader Sophie in't Veld (17 per cent). The MP Barry Madlener, appointed to head the list of the PVV, was known by only 8 per cent of the voters. Almost equally unknown was Thijs Berman, who headed the list of the PvdA and who had been an MEP since 2004. Green Left appointed a city councilor from Amsterdam, while the Socialist Party and the Christian Union (ChristenUnie) each selected a public servant. It is clear that Dutch political parties did not send their national figureheads to Europe; in fact, they have never done so. Nor is it customary for Dutch political heavyweights to continue their career in Brussels and Strasbourg, as, for example, the former Belgian prime ministers Dehaene and Verhofstadt have done. The consequence of this practice is that those at the top of the party lists are not well‐known: more than half (56 per cent) of Dutch voters knew none of the candidates heading the party lists just a few days before the June 2009 elections.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the use of Twitter and social networking sites, and despite a dozen national leaders' debates and ample media attention, the European election campaign never really got off the ground. Obviously, there was little interest in Europe. As soon as the subject was mentioned on the main national television news programme, about 200,000 to 300,000 viewers switched to another channel. Following the Queen's Day (30 April) attack on the royal family, when a man drove his car into the crowd, killing six people, the campaign was suspended for five days out of respect for the victims and their families. Perhaps the lack of interest was in part due to the fact that, much more so than previously, the election campaign hardly touched on the domestic political situation. In fact, only the PVV leader Geert Wilders tried to do so, calling on his supporters to vote against the ‘disastrous Balkenende‐Bos Cabinet’. National party leaders also kept themselves more in the background than usual. With the exception of a hot air balloon featuring the face of Prime Minister Jan‐Peter Balkenende, national political leaders barely played a role in the campaign.</p>
         
         <p>Whereas national issues did not set the tone for the campaign, it was not a truly European campaign either. Topics like the European Parliament, a European approach to climate change and the economic crisis, and the Treaty of Lisbon did not attract a lot of attention. Inasmuch as there was any campaign theme at all, it concerned the extent to which Dutch national interests should be the deciding factor in Europe, or the possible accession of Turkey (mainly due to the agitation of the Freedom Party).</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Election analysis</h2>
         
         <p>A high turnout could hardly be expected after such a lacklustre campaign. Following the recovery in the 2004 European elections, which saw a turnout of almost 40 per cent, and then the 63 per cent turnout in the 2005 referendum, voter numbers fell below 37 per cent in 2009. The Netherlands had the lowest turnout of the six founding members of the European Economic Community, and was also well below the average European turnout of 43 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>The mainstream parties straddling the political centre lost heavily. As in the 2004 European elections and the 2006 Dutch general elections, the CDA remained the largest party but, at 20 per cent, its share of the vote was the lowest since the first direct European elections in 1979. Like the Christian Democrats, the PvdA recorded its worst result by far since 1979: only 12 per cent. The party also lost ground compared to the parliamentary elections of 2006 (placing it firmly in the Western European trend of losing social democratic parties). There can be no doubt that voter dissatisfaction with the governing coalition also contributed to the losses incurred by these two governing parties, but the second‐largest opposition party, the VVD, also lost with respect to the previous European and national elections, and they, too, recorded their worst ‘European’ result ever. The smallest coalition partner, the Christian Union, had combined its list with the Political Reformed Party; together they made a gain of 0.9 per cent, but because this involved both an opposition and a governing party, the result is difficult to interpret.</p>
         
         <p>The fact that both the two largest government parties and a major opposition party suffered substantial losses suggests that the European elections, as in 2004, were not only decided by national political issues. The elections did not revolve around the public's assessment of cabinet policy, as is so often the case with second‐order elections. This does not mean, however, that no national factors were at work. Antipathy towards the political establishment, evident among a sector of the electorate since the beginning of this century, made itself felt once again. This time it was not the left‐wing populist and Eurosceptic Socialist Party that managed to reap the benefits – the party remained fairly stable at 7 per cent. Instead, the European elections of 2009 marked the breakthrough of the right‐wing populist PVV, which became the second‐largest party, with no less than 17 per cent of the votes. Paradoxically, the party which had abhorred the Treaty of Lisbon, benefited in electoral terms from its entry into force. The 26th seat, which under the terms of the Treaty became available for the Netherlands in the European Parliament, went to the PVV, giving it the same number of seats as the Christian Democrats. Together, the Socialists and the Freedom Party gained almost a quarter of the votes, although this was much less than the 62 per cent that voted against the European Constitution in the referendum of 2005.</p>
         
         <p>The dynamic between the established political order and its populist opponents may not be the only mechanism that affected the result. Among the winners were also the two most decidedly pro‐European, internationalist parties, which suggests that Europe was indeed a factor in these elections. D66 climbed out of its electoral trough, achieving its second‐best result in the European elections in thirty years, as did Green Left. Hence, one might conclude that voters were seeking out the extremes on the European political spectrum, and were doing so at the expense of the centrist parties that had adopted an equivocal ‘Eurorealist’ position – accepting European integration while at the same time calling into question the pace of European unification and expansion. In the words of one journalist: ‘Clarity won, fog was punished.’</p>

         <p>The banking crisis that erupted in the Netherlands in the autumn of 2008 and the ensuing financial and economic decline created the need for a new coalition agreement. The government decided to stimulate economic recovery in 2009 and 2010, partly by speeding up public works that would improve infrastructure. As of 2011, however, drastic reductions in public spending would be called for. In March 2009 the government installed several task forces of civil servants that would map out alternative options for cutbacks of about €35 billion. Two options proved attractive for some, but controversial for others: abolishing tax relief for mortgages on houses and raising the threshold for old‐age pensions from 65 to 67 years. (This concerned only the general state pension (Algemene Ouderdomswet, AOW) but would also affect other pensions indirectly.) The cabinet rejected the first option, but in October agreed on the latter. Trade unions and employers had tried to negotiate a proposal about the old‐age pensions in the Socio‐Economic Council (Sociaal‐Economische Raad, SER), but failed to reach an agreement. A majority in Parliament seemed to favour the option, but disagreed about important details like the question of whether workers might still be allowed to receive their pension at the age of 65 if their work had been particularly heavy or unhealthy. Most decisions about public spending cuts were deferred till 2010. The Liberal Party accused the cabinet of indecisiveness and introduced a motion of no‐confidence, but failed to mobilise substantial support for it.</p>
         
         <p>In 2007 the Dutch government had agreed to maintain troops in Afghanistan (as part of the ISAF) until 2010. In October, a broad parliamentary majority confirmed the decision to leave by 2010, against the suggestion of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Verhagen, to keep other options open. Only Verhagen's Christian Democratic Party and two smaller parties supported the Minister. When the American government asked the Dutch government in December to prolong its mission in some form even after 2010, it caused considerable tension within the coalition. The Christian Democrats seemed willing to reconsider the earlier decision, but the PvdA firmly refused to do so.</p>
         
         <p>Another issue that was often discussed in 2009 concerned Dutch involvement in the war in Iraq. When they joined a coalition with the PvdA and the Christian Union in 2007, the Christian Democrats had insisted that this would not be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry – as the Labour Party had suggested. Not only the PvdA and the left‐wing opposition parties, but also the VVD, which had supported the Dutch involvement in 2003, favoured an inquiry. Together these parties held a majority in the upper house. In February 2009 a compromise was reached: the question would be investigated by an independent (nonpartisan) commission of scholars (mainly specialists in international law and international relations) but not by a parliamentary commission. The independent commission would be chaired by Willibrord Davids, retired president of the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad). Initially it intended to present its report in November, but this was postponed till February 2010.</p>

         <p>In April the cabinet decided, in agreement with the upper house, to raise the threshold for preferential votes in the (indirect) election of the upper house.Moreover, party lists could no longer be linked after the elections. In July, the cabinet installed a Government Commission that would draft a preamble for the Constitution – which so far had not had a preamble. The new bill on party funding, promised in 2008, was not submitted to Parliament in 2009.</p>
