         <p>One of the dominant themes in Danish party politics in the beginning of 2007 were the problems experienced by the Social Liberal Party in their attempts to reach agreement internally regarding its parliamentary strategy. The disagreement was basically about the extent to which the first priority of the party should be to work to reduce the influence of the Danish People's Party by continuing to work together with the Social Democrats or taking their chances by becoming either a full partner in a right‐of‐centre government or a support party for such a government. It was against this background that rumours began circulating that Social Liberal MP Naser Khader, who advocated closer collaboration with the Government, was considering defecting to another party or even creating his own party. Khader vehemently denied both rumours.</p>
         
         <p>On 7 April, exactly one year after the Social Liberals walked away from their long‐term partnership with the Social Democrats, Social Liberal leader Marianne Jelved signalled that if the Social Democrats were ready to discuss taxes and immigration policy, among other things, the Social Liberals were prepared to try to find a compromise. She accompanied this message with a remark that she would like to share an understanding with the Social Democrats and would not reject out‐of‐hand Social Liberal support for Social Democrat leader Helle Thorning‐Schmidt as Prime Minister – as long as the Social Democrats met the Social Liberals halfway. Opinion polls indicating a considerable fall in support for the Social Liberals possibly contributed to Jelved's new signal, just as they showed that two out of three Social Liberal voters would like to see the re‐establishment of the former alliance with the Social Democrats.</p>
         
         <p>On 7 May, the disagreement among the Social Liberals came to a head and the parliamentary situation that had remained stable for almost six years was shaken up when Naser Khader, together with MEPs Anders Samuelsen (Social Liberal) and Gitte Seeberg (Conservative), announced that they had formed a new political party: New Alliance. The name was chosen because, they said, they wanted to create a new alliance between the political blocs, between Denmark and the rest of the world, and between politicians and the electorate. They did not, though, present a party programme. The programme was to be developed in collaboration with the new party members over the course of the Summer. However, the three did declare that they would work for the following: taxation reform whereby taxes would be reduced to a maximum of 40 per cent for everyone; a realistic immigration policy and humane asylum policy with an emphasis on democratic integration; and an end to the Danish People's Party defining politics against the will of most of the people. New Alliance stood for a global perspective and wanted to work for a strong European Union (EU). They primarily saw the significance of the new party in terms of a catalyst for change in the party system and the patterns of cooperation in the Danish parliament.</p>

         <p>During the course of the so‐called ‘cartoon crisis’, Naser Khader – a declared anti‐Islamist Muslim and renowned supporter of Danish democracy – achieved massive popularity amongst the voters, and New Alliance received an overwhelmingly positive reception. The opinion polls indicated that the party would receive votes from 9–12 per cent of the electorate, translating into more than enough seats to place the party in a central position in the majority in the Folketing. The enthusiasm was beginning to lag towards the end of the Summer, however, as the opinion polls now indicated 4–5 per cent support for the party – still high for a new party, but the honeymoon was over.</p>
         
         <p>For the first time in the history of the Social Liberal Party, it experienced an actual split. Against that background, the parliamentary group planned a number of meetings in order to formulate a forward‐looking strategy. It eventually became clear that a major shuffle in the party leadership was around the corner. This happened on 15 June, when the third meeting was held. After 19 years leading the party, Marianne Jelved stepped aside to make room for her deputy, Margrethe Vestager, who was elected party chairman without any opposition. The party then established a platform on three key issues: decent immigration and asylum policy; better stewardship of the climate and the environment; and public sector reform. Its desire to keep the Danish People's Party from influencing government remained alive. The Social Liberal Party aimed to re‐gain its traditional pivotal position in Danish politics.</p>

         <p>Another dominant theme in the first half of 2007 concerned welfare policy and the Government's so‐called ‘quality reform’ of the public sector. At the end of January, the Social Democrats made a play and proposed the introduction of a number of ‘quality rights’ for the people to have to public services in the form of uniform national minimum standards (e.g., standards for care for the elderly and childcare). The Social Democrats accompanied this message with repeated calls for investment in welfare instead of tax cuts. The Government did not support minimum standards or the centralistic, bureaucratic and controlling system, which it believed would result from the proposal.</p>
         
         <p>In March, The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) declared that it wanted to reach an agreement with the Government that was to stand until 2025. The agreement was to cover details outside of the ordinary collective agreement, details dealing with everyday life for employees in the public sector. The Government reacted positively to this proposal. Successful negotiations towards this end would decisively reinforce the Government's chances of obtaining broad support for its so‐called ‘quality reform’, as it was difficult to imagine that the Social Democrats would be able to oppose such a proposal if such large segments of the trade union movement reached a settlement with the Government on it. Conversely, it was also risky for the Government, as a negative result would considerably strengthen the Social Democrat's agitation against the Government. At the same time, the Government parties increasingly sent signals that the original goal – that the quality reform should be held within the existing economic framework – was not realistic.</p>
         
         <p>In June, the Government reached an agreement with the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations (AC), the Confederation of Professionals in Denmark (FTF), Local Government Denmark (KL) and Danish Regions consisting of a total of 42 points and a total price of DKK6.5 billion. Over a three‐year period, the money was to be used mainly for more education, improved working environments, seniors' agreements and better management in the public sector. The Government subsequently presented a comprehensive outline of the quality reform that was to be further specified so that the final proposal could be announced in the Autumn; however, it was overtaken by political developments.</p>
         
         <p>With the billions of Danish Crowns involved in the negotiations and the further billions tied up in the agreements for 2008 with the Danish municipalities and regions, the public purse was wide open, the Government thereby removing the sting from the Social Democratic welfare campaign against it. With these agreements in place, persistent rumours began to circulate in August that the Prime Minister would exploit the situation to call elections (in Denmark, the Prime Minister can call elections whenever he or she wishes to do so). The rumours increased after the Government presented three political proposals: the quality reform of the public sector; economic objectives until 2015 – including the freeze on taxes and limits on public spending, which is to follow the growth of the national economy; and a tax plan involving income tax cuts and increased taxes on energy on environmental grounds.</p>
         
         <p>As it turned out, the tax plan got in the way of reaching agreement with the Government's support party, the Danish People's Party. These difficulties put a temporary stop to rumours about impending elections. The Conservatives had long called for considerable tax cuts for the highest incomes, while the Danish People's Party stuck to tax cuts for low incomes. The election rumours meant that all of the parties now negotiated more with respect to an impending election campaign than in relation to any actual political substance. The Government and the Danish People's Party were able to reach a relatively complicated technical settlement, which largely appeased the two main adversaries. Income tax cuts were the main result. However, the course of events had revealed considerable disagreement within the Government between the Liberals and the Conservatives and between the Government and its support party.</p>
         
         <p>In mid‐September, the Prime Minister carried out a minor re‐shuffle, presumably in order to strengthen the Government team before a future election. The most remarkable move was the appointment of Karen Jespersen as Minister of Social Affairs. Jespersen had previously been an active Marxist in the Left Socialist Party and later a minister in Social Democratic governments, where she enjoyed great popularity. She had broken with the Social Democrats, as she found that their immigration policy was too lax and threatened the cohesion of Danish society.</p>
         
         <p>The negotiations about the Government's proposals proceeded rather sluggishly. In conjunction with the opening of the parliament in the beginning of October, there were massive demonstrations across the country in which public sector employees called for better working conditions and higher pay. Against this background, the Prime Minister called elections on 24 October that were to be held on 13 November. He reasoned that it was impossible to lead serious negotiations with the parties because they were all setting their tactics in relation to their expectations for an impending election; it made sense to clear the air. Another factor was that the collective agreement negotiations with the public sector employees were to be held at the beginning of 2008, at which time it would presumably be very difficult to meet the great demands and expectations for increased pay that had developed over time. Moreover, the expected electoral benefits from the aforementioned tax cuts had to be harvested immediately. Finally, another factor playing a role was that a quick election might prevent New Alliance from being able to establish its organisation and become planted in the awareness of the electorate.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The general election</h2>
         
         <p>A total of nine parties were on the ballot, which was the lowest number since 1973. The main themes in the election campaign were tax cuts versus increased welfare, pay and working conditions for employees in the public sector, energy and environmental policy, immigration policy and the most important theme of all: who was to be entrusted with the power of government. According to the opposition – as well as some of the members of the Government parties – the tight‐knit collaboration established in 2001 between the Government and the Danish People's Party was to be broken. However, this was made difficult by the fact that the Government was not confronted by a unified opposition. The strategic dilemma of the Social Liberal Party remained: should the party point towards a Social Democrat for prime minister, or should they back a right‐of‐centre prime minister? As the election campaign proceeded, it became clear that the party would support Helle Thorning‐Schmidt. For example, the Social Liberals declared that they would not demand the rescinding of the so‐called ‘24‐year rule’ and the rule about cumulative attachment in order to be part of a Social Democrat‐led Government, and the Social Democrats declared that they would rescind the elementary school settlement with the Government in order to satisfy one of the key issues for the Social Liberals. The Socialist People's Party repeatedly declared that they would not get in the way of a Social Democrat‐led Government.</p>
         
         <p>Right up until the day of the elections, opinion polls indicated a photo‐finish between the two blocs. New Alliance could have played a decisive role, but they had great difficulty indicating who they would support as prime minister. New Alliance waited until the last possible opportunity to begrudgingly declare Anders Fogh as their first choice. All in all, New Alliance – with its many inexperienced candidates and a fumbling leadership – seemed uncertain, unspecific and hesitant in the political debates.</p>
         
         <p>On 13 November, 86.6 per cent of the electorate participated in the election, a 2.1 percentage point increase compared to the 2005 elections. Denmark thus maintained its position as one of the countries in Europe with the highest turnout when the countries in which there is a legal obligation to vote are not included. Half of the votes were personal votes and the other half for party lists. The voters could choose between 808 candidates representing the nine parties; 260 women had been nominated and 66 elected to the Folketing, which was the same number as in 2005.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the divide in the electorate that could be traced in the opinion polls immediately after the New Alliance had been formed, the election result only produced moderate fluctuation, with a net volatility of 13 per cent and a gross volatility of almost 25 per cent. The movement of voters across the middle was also limited. The Social Liberals were the big loser; the eight seats lost neutralised their gains in the 2005 election. The uncertainty about the party's general parliamentary strategy, the new party leadership and its policy shifts during the election offer likely explanations.</p>
         
         <p>The Social Democrats suffered very limited losses, but these still led to the worst election result for the party since 1906. Nevertheless, the general perception within the party – which is accustomed to being in government – and with the general public was that party leader Helle Thorning‐Schmidt had orchestrated a good election campaign and matched Anders Fogh Rasmussen in their duels and debates. There was no leadership purge on the immediate horizon. The big winner among the opposition parties was the Socialist People's Party, which doubled its number of seats. This was Villy Søvndal's first election as party leader, and his fresh, less dogmatic personal style together with the fact that the party presented itself as a more socialist‐toned party and a declared defender of the welfare state than the Social Democrats can account for its success.</p>
         
         <p>Of the Government parties, the Conservatives were able to maintain their number of seats, while the Liberals again registered losses, this time amounting to six seats. Leading the Government had taken a toll on the party. The Government's support party, the Danish People's Party, gained a single seat and solidified its position as the third largest party in the Folketing while simultaneously confirming the general party line and that there was still support from 14 per cent of the electorate for a very restrictive immigration and asylum policy.</p>
         
         <p>It is debatable whether New Alliance won or lost. The fact that the party won representation in the Folketing a mere half year after being created was a clear victory. Aside from the Danish People's Party, which was a splinter party from the Progress Party, and the Red‐Green Alliance, which was an amalgamation of already‐existing small left‐wing parties, this had only occurred once since 1973 – namely in 1987, when <i>Fælleskurs</i> (the Common Course) won representation in the Folketing. However, it is still possible to question whether New Alliance is to be considered among the winners or losers since opinion polls indicated that the party lost a great number of potential voters in the second half of the election campaign. The new party picked up votes from all of the other parties, though most from the Social Liberals, Liberals and the Conservatives.
         </p>
         
         <p>The central question throughout the election was whether the Government would be able to continue. It was a very close race. The Government was only just able to amass the magic number of 90 seats with the support of the Danish People's Party and one of the two members of the Danish parliament representing the Faroe Islands, who had joined the Liberal parliamentary group. This was the smallest possible majority, so there was not room for a single MP from the Government‐supporting parties to leave the party or be excluded, which had actually occurred a number of times in the previous two election periods. The Danish People's Party in particular had excluded members.</p>
         
         <p>If New Alliance also chose to support the Government, the majority would be more comfortable and certain, but that would require the Danish People's Party making immigration policy concessions to the New Alliance. This was a central area for both parties, but they had opposed viewpoints. The Danish People's Party was not prepared to make such concessions; they were not prepared to lose the central position they had occupied since 2001 as the Government's sole support party.</p>
         
         <p>The Government had not stepped down when the election had been called, and as there was no majority against it after the election, Anders Fogh Rasmussen continued. He declared that the election had taught him that the Government had to work harder to achieve a broader majority behind its policies. He therefore began negotiations with all of the parties with respect to the formation of a new Government programme. This was announced on 22 November and signalled an increased orientation towards the middle ground on all policy areas with the exception of immigration policy. Here, the Government had reached an agreement with the Danish People's Party, which insisted that changes in this settlement alone had to be negotiated with the settlement parties – and no others.</p>
         
         <p>The Prime Minister presented his team of ministers the next day. The appointment of Birthe Rønn Hornbech was the most remarkable detail, which was interpreted as a concession to New Alliance and a signal that broad solutions could also be found in relation to immigration policy. The important post as Minister of Finance went to Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the next‐in‐command in the Liberals and heir‐apparent to Anders Fogh Rasmussen.</p>
         
         <p>The unthinkable already struck the Government in the beginning of December: Conservative MP Pia Christmas Møller announced that she had left the Conservatives and would continue in parliament as an independent. She had previously led the Conservatives for a short period and had held numerous other high positions. She lost her faith in the party leadership after not being appointed minister or being able to retain her position as political spokesperson. She continued to support the Government, so it was not under imminent threat, but this applied further pressure on the Government to find broad solutions as opposed to relying solely on the Danish People's Party. New Alliance thus came to occupy a central position between the two blocs – one of the reasons for creating the party in the first place, of course. This dramatic development challenged the stable patterns of cooperation established in parliament in 2001. With prospects for a possible return to the full‐fledged minority government parliamentary activity of the 1970s and 1980s, Danish MPs left for Christmas vacation.</p>
