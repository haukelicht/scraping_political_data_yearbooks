      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> The year in politics</h2>
         
         <p>In many ways 2007 was marked by a hiatus in Canada's national politics. There was much parliamentary sound and fury, with the Conservatives in office for a second year as a minority government, but little appeared to be accomplished. By the end of the year, the two smaller parties – the New Democrats and Bloc Québécois – had adopted a complete oppositionist mentality and announced they were prepared to see the government defeated. This left the Liberals to prop up a government they opposed by the unseemly tactic of abstaining on increasing numbers of parliamentary votes. However, the reality was that none of the parties wanted an election. The polls made it clear that there was no likelihood of either of the two large parties obtaining a majority, and both smaller parties would probably have lost ground. Yet, convinced that minorities were abnormal and temporary, there was little evidence that the country's national politicians were interested in learning to make a minority parliament work. In this, the parliamentarians were egged on by a media that ignored a new law providing for a fixed election date and speculated endlessly on the prospect of an early election.</p>
         
         <p>The political system continues to suffer from some of the uncertainty visited upon the party system by the great electoral earthquake of 1993 (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 1994</a></span>: 263–266). Not only has its impact made the creation of national majorities exceedingly difficult, but individual politicians continue to struggle to find their place in the newly aligned system. In 2007, two Liberals crossed the floor to join the Conservatives, and one Conservative moved in the opposite direction. These were not insignificant figures: the Conservative had once been a (1993) candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party, and one of the Liberals had been a member of the last (2004) Liberal Government.
         </p>
         
         <p>Senate politics, or at least the politics of the Senate, were no less unsettled. During its first year in office, the Conservative Government introduced legislation to limit Senators' terms (from appointment to age 75 to an 8‐year term), and to hold elections for Senate places (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2007</a></span>: 915). Both bills remained on the parliamentary agenda, and were again endorsed as a government priority in a ‘Speech from the Throne’ opening a new session of parliament in October, but neither appeared to make any headway. With about a dozen vacancies, the Prime Minister might have been expected to act, making appointments to reward his supporters and shrink the Liberals' advantage in the upper House. However, he made only one – to a man who had won one of the ‘Senate elections’ held by the Alberta provincial government in support of the concept of an elected Senate. This, along with his apparent willingness to otherwise leave seats vacant, was a clear signal that the Prime Minister was serious about his proposal to create an elected Senate.
         </p>
         
         <p>The government was restructured twice during the year. Both sets of changes appear to have been stimulated by the political need to strengthen particular policy areas, but, as is common with Canadian shuffles, each set off a wider reaching set of changes. In January, the government realised that it had to present a stronger front on environmental issues, so one of Harper's most aggressive ministers was given that portfolio. Midway through the year it was clear that the government was not successfully selling its Afghanistan policy; Canadian troops were patrolling the most dangerous and violent part of that country and suffering loses not seen by Canadian forces in decades. Thus the decision to replace the Minister of Defence with the former leader of the Progressive Conservatives led to a second major change in the government. Afghanistan continued to be a highly contentious issue with a decision looming on how long the country would continue to participate in the United Nations operation there. At year's end, the Prime Minister appointed an Independent Task Force, headed by a former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, to assess the situation and report back to parliament in the new year.</p>
         
         <p>If national politics appeared noisy but uneventful, there was a good deal of activity at the provincial level: six of the provinces and one of the territories held general elections. In three, the outgoing premier and government were returned; in another three they were defeated and a new government was formed; and in one case (Quebec) the government was returned, but reduced from a majority to a minority position. There are currently two provinces in which minority parliaments are operating (in Nova Scotia, four successive elections have returned minority legislatures) and the national parliamentarians might well take lessons from them.</p>
         
         <p>The electoral reform movement had another opportunity to advance its cause during the year when the Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform recommended that the province switch from first‐past‐the‐post to a mixed member proportional system. The recommendation was put to public referendum at the time of the provincial general election in October, but won only 37 per cent of the vote, passing in just five of the 107 districts. While British Columbia will rerun its referendum on the Single Transferable Vote (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2006</a></span>: 1069) in 2009, the prospects for significant electoral reform must now appear dim.
