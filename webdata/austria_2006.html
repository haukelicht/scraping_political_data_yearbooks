         <p>Government formation after the general election on 1 October 2006 turned out to be a difficult endeavour, although (or because) the election results left only one option – that of a coalition between the Social Democratic Party of Austria (<i>Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs</i>, SPÖ) and the Christian democratic Austrian People's Party (<i>Österreichische Volkspartei</i>, ÖVP). The relationship between these two parties had been characterised by tremendous hostility ever since the ÖVP had formed a coalition with the right‐wing, populist Freedom Party of Austria (<i>Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs</i>, FPÖ) in February 2000, thereby relegating the SPÖ to the opposition benches (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2001</a></span>: 245–249). Moreover, the SPÖ, which had won the elections (albeit with only a 1 per cent lead over the ÖVP), had made excessive, unrealistic promises during its election campaigns (see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 876–883), which it found hard to enforce in the coalition negotiations. In particular, the SPÖ negotiators tried to stop the purchase of Euro‐fighters and to lift the tuition fees for university students, which had been introduced in 2001, but they were not able to overcome the resistance of the ÖVP.

         <p>In spite of this, for the third time since 1945 a ‘grand coalition’ was established (SPÖ and ÖVP had already governed the country together in 1945–1966 and 1987–2000). The SPÖ leadership argued that it had left its stamp in the social chapters of the government programme, which contained plans for a guaranteed minimum income, higher pensions and lower patient's contributions in case of chronic diseases. The verdict of the opposition parties, the mass media and the rank‐and‐file of the SPÖ was different, however. In the following months, SPÖ Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer was perpetually accused of having put his personal ambition (to become Chancellor) above the political interests of his party. His predecessor, Wolfgang Schüssel, might have been the biggest loser of the general elections, but, as chief negotiator of the ÖVP, he had succeeded in ‘winning’ the coalition negotiations (see, e.g., <i>Der Standard</i>, 9 January 2007). The opposition parties ironically congratulated Gusenbauer on having become ‘the first SPÖ Chancellor of a ÖVP government’.
         </p>
         
         <p>A look at the distribution of cabinet portfolios substantiates these assessments. Regarding numbers, the posts in the new government (Gusenbauer I) were evenly divided between the two coalition partners. The SPÖ nominated seven ministers (including the Chancellor) and three state‐secretaries – and so did the ÖVP (if we do not count the position of the Vice‐Chancellor). Regarding the power and prestige of the portfolios, however, the ÖVP was clearly the winner: it got the ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, the Interior and Economics. Besides, the SPÖ had struggled in vain to split labour affairs from the Ministry for Economic Affairs and environment from the Ministry for Agriculture (both led by the ÖVP) and to move them to SPÖ ministries. Not surprisingly, the coalition pact was supported only by a relatively modest three‐quarters of the SPÖ party executive (in particular, representatives of the provincial organisation of Upper Austria of the youth and the pensioners voted against the agreement, while the trade union wing said ‘yes’ with reservations). The SPÖ leadership was blamed by representatives of provincial party organisations for its compromises and for its (inadequate) internal communication before signing the coalition pact. Disappointed SPÖ members protested against the agreement; many left the party. According to opinion polls, 55 per cent of the respondents believed that the SPÖ had made too many concessions to its coalition partner (<i>profil</i>, 15 January 2007). In the ÖVP party executive, satisfaction was clearly higher – only two members (the party chairman of the provincial organisation of Salzburg and the representative of the ÖVP party group in the second chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat) voted against the coalition pact.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of the SPÖ cabinet members, no one had served in that capacity before; some of them even lacked any government experience. The new Chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, had been an MP since 1993; in 2000, he had been elected party chairman and chairman of the parliamentary group of the SPÖ. As is usual in any coalition in which the SPÖ takes part, it received the Ministry for Social Affairs. Its head was Erwin Buchinger, who had served in the provincial directorate of the Public Employment Service (AMS), before he was elected as a member of government (responsible for social affairs) in the province of Salzburg in 2004. With Norbert Darabos, who had been chief secretary of the SPÖ since 2003, the SPÖ for the first time in a grand coalition was able to nominate the Minister for National Defence (though with the difficult task of re‐negotiating the Euro‐fighter contract with the construction company EADS; see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below). The new commander of the armed forces was criticised because he had not done military service, but rather the alternative (civilian) service. Member of the municipal council (since 1985) and member of the municipal government (since 1994) in the capital city of Vienna, Werner Faymann was to direct the Ministry for Infrastructure. A surprise was the appointment of Claudia Schmied, who had worked in higher positions in banks and credit companies, as Minister of Education. Maria Berger, who had been civil servant in several ministries and, since 1996, Member of the European Parliament, was appointed Minister of Justice. The SPÖ succeeded in re‐establishing a Ministry for Women, which had been dissolved in 2000. The new Minister, Doris Bures, however, did not get her own ministry, but was situated in the Chancellery and also responsible for media and the public services. Bures had been an MP since 1990; since 2000, she had also worked as chief secretary of the SPÖ.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP cabinet team was led by the new Vice‐Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, who had been Federal Minister for Agriculture from 1994 until 2003 and chairman of the ÖVP group in the national parliament after that. Molterer also took over the Ministry of Finance. The plan of outgoing Chancellor Schüssel to install Karl‐Heinz Grasser – the young, popular former FPÖ politician, whom he had persuaded to join the ÖVP government team in the run‐up to the general elections of 2002 (see <span title=""><a href="#b1000" id="#b1000R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2003</a></span>: 893) – as Vice‐Chancellor and Minister of Finance was prevented by some members of the ÖVP party executive, who were sceptical about this initiative to ‘open’ the party. Schüssel himself, who obviously resented the idea of serving as Vice‐Chancellor under a SPÖ Chancellor, also stepped down as party chairman, but continued his political career as the new chairman of the ÖVP group in the national parliament. Molterer was designated by the ÖVP executive to become the new party chairman; he was formally elected by the party congress in April with 97 per cent of the votes.
         </p>
         
         <p>As opposed to his SPÖ Chancellor and Party Chairman Gusenbauer, the new Vice‐Chancellor and ÖVP Party Chairman Molterer could to a large part rely on an experienced government team. He inherited the ministers for Foreign Affairs (the ministry was renamed ‘Ministry for European and International Affairs’), Economic Affairs and Agriculture. Günther Platter, since 2003 Minister for National Defence, moved into the Ministry of the Interior (responsible also for migration). Andrea Kdolsky, a specialist in anaesthesia and intensive medicine and since 2006 manager of the hospitals in the province of Lower Austria, became the New Minister for Health, Family and Youth. The ÖVP team was completed by Johannes Hahn, a member since 1996 of the municipal council in Vienna and since 2005 chairman of the local ÖVP party organisation, who was appointed the new Minister for Science and Research. While the continuity in the cabinet team for the major portfolios (and the new political function for Chancellor Schüssel) indicated that the ÖVP did not intend to change its policies fundamentally, the nominations of Kdolsky and Hahn were interpreted as signals for a slight opening of the party.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to the ministers, each of the coalition parties nominated three state secretaries, who are formally not cabinet members, but are subordinate to ministers and participate in cabinet meetings in a consultative function. The SPÖ was assigned state secretaries in the Chancellery (responsible for regional policy and administrative reform), in the Finance and in the Infrastructure Ministry. The state secretaries of the ÖVP serve in the Chancellery (responsible for sports), in the Ministry for European and International Affairs and in the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Labour.</p>
         
         <p>The new government did not receive a cordial welcome. The opposition parties and most of the media agreed that the coalition programme basically continued the policies of the former government (in particular with respect to economic policy) and lacked any vision. It was hoped, however, that, after the highly controversial era of the ÖVP‐FPÖ (later BZÖ– Alliance for the Future of Austria/<i>Bündnis Zukunft Österreich</i>) government since 2000, a new era characterised by fewer extremes, more respect for the constitution, more tolerance towards migrants and a more civilised political discourse would begin (<i>Der Standard</i>, 10 January 2007).
         </p>
         
         <p>A cooperative spirit between the government parties was developed only slowly. Time and again, one party got information about initiatives by its coalition partner (e.g., legislative proposals or the nomination of government consultants) from the media rather than in advance. Often, one party accused the other of deviating from the coalition programme. Another strategy was to have the party executives take principled decisions on controversial matters, thereby precluding further inter‐party negotiations. The ÖVP acted as veto power in government and rejected, among other things, new inheritance and gift taxes. The existing taxes had been repealed by the Constitutional Court as being based on unrealistic calculations of the underlying properties. Although the SPÖ would have preferred to reform the taxes, the ÖVP insisted on abolishing them altogether. Even a petition signed by over 300 economists, who pointed out that in 2006 only 1.26 per cent of the whole tax income in Austria was derived from property taxes, compared to 5.49 per cent in the EU‐15, and that a complete abolition of the taxes would increase the social inequality of the tax system, did not change the ÖVP's mind.</p>
         
         <p>Intra‐coalition conflicts prevailed throughout the year, concerning questions such as education, nursing, and immigration and asylum policy (see <b>Issues in national politics</b> below). ÖVP politicians compared Chancellor Gusenbauer to his predecessor Schüssel and deplored a lack of leadership qualities; when asked to give reasons for the continuing infighting and slow progress, ÖVP representatives hinted at the SPÖ team's lack of government experience. SPÖ politicians, on the other hand, lamented that the ÖVP still had not accepted its electoral defeat and its role as only second player in the coalition. They speculated that Vice‐Chancellor Molterer was simply a vassal of former Chancellor Schüssel, who, presiding over the ÖVP's parliamentary group, acted as an <i>eminence grise</i>, defending his political heritage and sabotaging major SPÖ initiatives.
         </p>
         
         <p>The government's poor performance resulted in a disastrous public image. Opinion polls, carried out two months after the government's formation, revealed that only 28 per cent of SPÖ sympathisers, compared to 38 per cent of ÖVP sympathisers, were satisfied with the work of the ‘grand coalition’. In the whole population, only 24 per cent were satisfied; at the same time, however, 38 per cent regarded a SPÖ‐ÖVP coalition as the ‘only solution’ (<i>Der Standard</i>, 4 April 2007). The SPÖ fell back behind the ÖVP in public support; it was permanently referred to as the party that had once more ‘fallen over’. An opinion poll at the end of the year showed that the voters had a good memory: while 50 per cent of the respondents blamed the ÖVP for having broken its electoral promises, a full 79 per cent thought the same of the SPÖ (<i>Der Standard</i>, 31 December 2007). Interestingly, the opposition parties were not able to exploit the unfavourable image of the government. The intra‐coalition conflicts dominated the news headlines. Even the FPÖ, which in the 1990s, in a similar constellation, had made successful inroads into the ranks of the SPÖ and ÖVP clientele, seemed paralysed and only rarely attracted public attention.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>In June, parliament, on the initiative of the governing parties, passed a major constitutional amendment (<i>Bundesgesetzblatt</i> I, Nr. 27/2007). Making Austria a pioneer in Europe, the right to vote in elections for the First Chamber of the national parliament (the Nationalrat), for the European Parliament and for the Federal President was lowered from 18 to 16 years, the right to be elected from 19 to 18 years (except for the Federal President, who still has to be older than 35 years). Because of the homogeneity principle with respect to the electoral systems, the nine provinces had to follow the national regulation and to introduce the lower voting age for the elections to their parliaments (the Landtage) as well (Burgenland, Salzburg and Vienna had already introduced it). The legislative period for the Nationalrat was lengthened from four to five years after the next general elections, so that future governments have more time to work, as the governing parties argued. Finally, postal voting was introduced, both for voters who are absent from their municipality on the day of elections and for Austrians living abroad. The Greens and BZÖ supported the reform; the FPÖ voted against it, as its claims to extend the minority rights in parliament and expand direct democracy were not taken into account.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the end of the year, a new court, the Asylum Court (<i>Asylgerichtshof</i>), was established and will start hearing cases on 1 July 2008 (<i>Bundesgesetzblatt</i> I, Nr. 2/2008; Art. 129c‐f <i>Bundes‐Verfassungsgesetz</i>). The Court should replace the second instance in the asylum procedure, the Independent Federal Asylum Review Board (<i>Unabhängiger Bundesasylsenat</i>). Its primary goal is to reduce the long list of over 33,000 pending asylum cases (<i>Der Standard</i>, 29 October 2007; see also <b>Issues in national politics</b> below). The government proposal provoked a very negative response from, among others, the President of the Administrative Court, the President of the Association of Judges and civil rights organisations (like the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), Amnesty International and ‘SOS Mitmensch’). In the end, three members of the SPÖ parliamentary group also refused to vote for the proposal. The criticisms focused on two points: all the Court's members were to be suggested by the government, and the legal channel for asylum seekers to the Administrative Court was cut (only the Minister of the Interior should get the right to refer ‘principal decisions’ to it). The amendment was decided without the usual assessment procedure for government proposals, in which the relevant ministries, provincial governments, interest groups and other interested organisations can send in comments. Not even the Ministry of Justice was integrated into the preparation of the proposal. The SPÖ and ÖVP leadership argued that an assessment procedure would have jeopardised the planned start for the Court's work in mid‐2008.
         </p>
         
         <p>With the same amendment, ‘social partnership’, the Austrian form of neocorporatism, was introduced into the federal constitution. In spite of the fact – or perhaps because of it – that the heyday of social partnership between capital, farming and labour, as a result of globalisation and European integration, was long over, the Republic now ‘recognised their role’ and ‘respected their autonomy’. Government representatives hinted that the new provision obliged the social partners (and other self‐governing bodies) to internal democracy and efficient management. Constitutional experts criticised the fact that it also cemented obligatory membership of the three chambers participating in social partnership: the Chambers of Business, Agriculture and Labour (the fourth member, the Trade Union Federation, is organised as free association). The fact that the coalition parties enacted the reform without having consulted the Constitutional Service (<i>Verfassungsdienst</i>), situated in the Chancellery, also provoked negative comments.

         <p>In spite of the antagonistic relationship between the two coalition parties, the government was able to realise some reforms during its first year in office. In addition to the constitutional reforms (see <b>Institutional changes</b> above), it passed, for example, a ‘double budget’ for the years 2008 and 2009. Although higher expenditure was planned for employment, education and social security, for 2010 a budget surplus of 0.38 per cent of GDP was envisaged (a result of a reduction of the number of civil servants and of growing tax incomes due to the good business outlook and to increases of the mineral oil tax as well as contributions to health insurance). A climate and energy fund was established; €50 million was to be spent in 2007 for projects helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to support renewable energy. A new law made it possible, starting in 2008, for paid maternity leave to be taken not only for three years, but also, with higher benefits, for two years and for 18 months. Parents earning more than €16,200 per year were excluded from the benefit (all other parties would have preferred to lift the income limit, but the ÖVP insisted on it). Finally, the SPÖ and ÖVP decided to raise sickness insurance contributions by 0.15 per cent from the beginning of 2008 in order to help the (provincial) sickness insurance funds, the deficits of which were predicted to rise from €167.2 million in 2006 to €336.1 million in 2007 (the structural problem that the contributions are based on the wages and therefore decline together with the declining wage share was not solved). The social partners contributed to the success in that they agreed on a minimum wage of €1,000 per month, to be implemented by collective treaties until the beginning of 2009. Up to 30,000 employees in cleaning and textile firms, in offices of doctors and lawyers were estimated to profit from the regulation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Intra‐coalition relations and, as a consequence, political reforms were considerably impeded by the two parliamentary committees set up by the Nationalrat in 2006 to investigate the Euro‐fighter purchase by the ÖVP‐FPÖ Government in 2002 and the 2006 BAWAG scandal as well as other dubious bank affairs (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 888–889). The ÖVP denounced the committees as nothing but ‘political tribunals’; the Vice‐Chancellor, Finance Minister and ÖVP Party Chairman Molterer hampered their proceedings by refusing to hand over (secret, as he claimed) government documents. Nevertheless, the Euro‐fighter committee highlighted quite a few dubious goings‐on. In spite of a provision in the 2000 coalition programme to go for low‐priced new planes, the cabinet decided unanimously in 2002 to buy the most expensive type, the Euro‐fighters, produced by the EADS Company. It was unclear why the Ministers of Finance and of Defence, who had favoured other models up to that time, gave up their resistance. The previous Finance Minister, Grasser, was suspected of having intervened on behalf of the company Magna, his former employer, which had close business relationships with EADS. Former Chancellor Schüssel, who had pressed for the Euro‐fighters, was accused of having pursued the goal to make Austria's air‐defence ‘NATO‐compatible’ (a severe accusation in the context of Austria's neutral status). A marketing firm, owned by a former FPÖ general secretary, received €6.6 million from EADS, but was unable to clarify what the money was used for (illegal party financing was suspected). An EADS lobbyist gave €87,600 to another marketing firm, owned by the wife of the chief of the air force, who sat in the commission of the Defence Ministry choosing the plane.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Euro‐fighter committee, however, did not find hard proofs of EADS intervention. Legal experts confirmed that the Government would run a high risk by cancelling the contract: EADS could demand compensation for accumulated costs, a lawsuit could go on for years and the Austrian military needed planes immediately. This is why the Minister for Defence Darabos (SPÖ) struck a deal with EADS, which led to a reduction in the number of planes (from 18 to 15) and saved the government about €400 million. The ÖVP fumed as Darabos had negotiated the deal alone; he was also accused of risking Austria's security (this was also the prevailing opinion in his own ministry) and of having neglected the fact that a lower price also meant less compensatory transactions by EADS with Austrian firms (the losses were estimated to amount to about €500 million). The Defence Minister was supported by Chancellor Gusenbauer, though, who obviously saw a chance to straighten his party's image of having broken a major electoral promise in the case. The Green chairman of the investigative committee, who had to admit that no ‘smoking gun’ had been found that might have allowed the cancellation of the contract, was also angry as Darabos had finalised his deal shortly before the committee was to finish its investigations. He reproached the SPÖ for having affronted parliament for the sake of easing relations with its coalition partner. The SPÖ used the fact that the Greens supported a FPÖ motion of no‐confidence against Minister Darabos to say good‐bye to a common final committee report. As a consequence, SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens/FPÖ formulated separate (minority) reports. The end of the Euro‐fighter investigative committee could hardly be seen as glorious; however, it was valued by the media as an excursion into parliamentary democracy, which had demonstrated the mixing of (party) political with economic interests.</p>
         
         <p>At the same time, the parliamentary committee established after the BAWAG scandal to investigate the transactions of major banks and financial market supervision (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 888–889) was abruptly concluded. Before important witnesses could be interrogated and relevant material of the tax authorities concerning the Trade Union Federation as well as the League of Industrialists was sent, the SPÖ and ÖVP used their majority to stop the investigation. Some aspects of the committee's mandate, like the responsibility of former Finance Minister Grasser, dubious ‘Eastern deals’, allegations of party financing and of money laundering, had not been dealt with at all. For the first time in the history of investigative committees (16 so far), no written report was produced. The SPÖ and ÖVP MPs simply called upon the Government to present a legislative proposal for a reform of financial market supervision. Vice‐Chancellor and ÖVP Chairman Molterer welcomed the end of both investigative committees; in his eyes, ‘rubbish’ had been cleared away (with ‘rubbish’ he referred to the investigative committees, not to their findings), and the Government could now concentrate on working effectively.
         </p>
         
         <p>Major projects the SPÖ and ÖVP pursued during the year, accompanied by serious disagreements, related to personal care and education policy. Since 1993, personal care has been subsidised in Austria; in 2007, 384,000 people received benefits. Nongovernmental organisations working in the field (like Caritas, the organisation of the Catholic Church) appealed to the Government to cope with the increasing numbers of people in need. About 15,000 ‘official’ care staff were registered, complemented by about 40,000 illegal, foreign carers. Until 1 July 2007, illegal carers were granted amnesty. In the month before, the responsible Ministers of Social Affairs, Buchinger (SPÖ), and Labour, Bartenstein (ÖVP), presented a provisional solution for 24‐hour care. ‘Self‐employed’ carers (with estimated costs, including taxes and social insurance contributions, of up to €2,000 per month) were to be subsidised by €225 per month, ‘employed’ carers (with costs of up to €2,850) by €800. As a solution, in particular regarding financing, could not be achieved, the amnesty had to be extended till the end of the year. The SPÖ and ÖVP agreed that the federal government should provide for 60 per cent of the costs, the provincial governments for 40 per cent (amounting to €70 million per year). However, the governing parties were confronted with severe criticisms as far as the high individual costs and relatively low subsidies for personal care were concerned. This is why the ÖVP proposed to extend the amnesty once more. The consent of the SPÖ could not be obtained, however; as a consequence, provincial politicians (the most prominent being the ÖVP Governor of Lower Austria, who had to fight general elections the following March) announced they would not implement the new law punishing illegal carers.</p>
         
         <p>Education policy ranked high on the political agenda after the ‘PISA shock’ caused by the mediocre results of Austrian pupils in the 2006 tests for the Programme for International Student Assessment. The SPÖ interpreted the results as a mandate to introduce a comprehensive school system (<i>Gesamtschule</i>) with internal differentiation and individual support for all pupils aged between 10 and 14. In fact, at present, the majority of children from poorer, less‐educated parents are sent to elementary schools (<i>Hauptschule</i>) at the age of 10, while most children from richer, better educated parents attend secondary schools (<i>Gymnasium</i>). Findings of international education research that such differentiated school systems preserve social differences had been ignored by the Austrian Ministry of Education, which had been directed by the ÖVP in all coalition governments since 1994. The same happened to warnings of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) that the social selection and the lack of horizontal as well as vertical mobility in the school system are also economically detrimental. Likewise, concepts by the ‘social partners’ (the four major economic interest groups: the Chambers of Business, Agriculture and Labour and the Trade Union Federation) and by the League of Industrialists, which both advocated the comprehensive school model, were repudiated by the ÖVP. The ÖVP argued that the existing system allowed for ‘free choice’ and rejected the SPÖ proposals as ‘ideological’.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ÖVP position was to a large degree determined by the public service branch within the trade unions, in which the teachers are organised (the public service branch is the only trade union organisation dominated by the ÖVP, and its chairman at the same time acts as the party's speaker for education). A platform called ‘School coloured’, which claimed to represent 80 per cent of the teachers of secondary schools, collected signatures against the SPÖ plans. Intra‐party pressure (e.g., by the Styrian party organisation and the Business League, one of the three major constituent organisations of the party) to adapt to social changes were turned down by the party leadership. An expert commission, summoned by the new Minister for Education Schmied (SPÖ) and headed by the former ÖVP president of the Styrian provincial school administration, was not able to convince the ÖVP. The ÖVP position was sustained by opinion polls, according to which 69.4 per cent of Austrians were opposed to comprehensive schooling (<i>Der Standard</i>, 30 April 2007). To some degree, Schmied herself was responsible for the negative attitude as she had failed to inform teachers and the public extensively about her plans.
         </p>
         
         <p>In December, a compromise was reached between the SPÖ Minister and the ÖVP so that parliament could amend the School Organisation Law. This amendment did not change the school system, but rather enabled ‘school trials’ for a ‘new middle school’ starting in the school year 2008/09 for a period of eight years. Following ÖVP demands, the law stipulated that these school trials have to be supported by two‐thirds of the teachers as well as of the parents in the respective schools. For the first round, about 40 schools (of a total of about 1,400) in ten model regions (in the three SPÖ‐dominated provinces of Burgenland, Salzburg and Styria and in the BZÖ‐dominated province of Carinthia) volunteered. Not only was the extension of new middle schools restricted, the ÖVP also saw to it that selective secondary schools would have to be offered in all model regions as well.</p>
         
         <p>The governing parties were more united (but no less criticised) as regards their immigration and asylum policy. When the President of the Constitutional Court suggested giving the right to stay in Austria to asylum seekers who had waited for more than three years for a decision in their case (i.e., 11,302 people in October; see <i>Die Presse</i>, 9 October 2007), he was fiercely attacked by ÖVP, FPÖ and BZÖ. When he advised the governing parties to repair urgently the laws regulating immigration and asylum (‘that's nothing like enough’), he was accused of ‘incompetence’ by the SPÖ party speaker for security. Criticisms by the Human Rights Advisory Board (<i>Menschenrechtsbeirat</i>) in the Ministry of the Interior that the legal status of foreigners in Austria violates Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which protects private and family life, were likewise ignored. The Government, driven by the ÖVP, declared that only in 2009 would enough information be available to evaluate the respective laws.
         </p>
         
         <p>In September, three Islamic terrorists, who had produced a video threatening attacks if Austrian (and German) soldiers were not withdrawn from Afghanistan, were arrested by the police. While SPÖ and Greens warned of panic reactions, ÖVP, FPÖ and BZÖ saw their restrictive policy of the past justified. Although the terrorists were members of an Islamic splinter group with no connections to the Islamic religious community, the ÖVP announced the necessity of a ‘value debate’. Minister of the Interior Platter (ÖVP) organised an ‘integration platform’, where nongovernmental organisations and representatives from religious communities were invited to make proposals for better understanding between different groups in the population (critics deplored the fact that hot issues were shamefully avoided, though). The FPÖ and BZÖ demanded regulations to prohibit the construction of minarets and the wearing of headscarves.</p>
         
         <p>In October, a spectacular case concerning a Kosovar refugee family, who had come illegally to Austria in 2001 and been denied asylum afterwards, seemed to reverse the public mood. After a father and his three sons had been expelled, his 15 year‐old daughter, named Arigona, went underground and was later hidden by a priest (the mother suffered from a nervous breakdown). The ‘Arigona case’ immediately dominated the news. After Minister Platter had promised not to expel the child until the Constitutional Court had decided the case, Arigona showed up. Platter was urged by SPÖ, Greens, representatives of civil society and even by the dominating tabloid of the country, the usually xenophobic <i>Kronenzeitung</i>, to use his prerogative to grant Arigona a right to stay on humanitarian grounds. Yet, the case was treated by SPÖ and ÖVP as being a single case of hardship, insufficient to justify changing the existing immigration and asylum laws (after all, the SPÖ, at that time in opposition, had agreed to the last package of restrictive laws in 2005; see <span title=""><a href="#b5" id="#b5R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2006</a></span>: 1049–1050). By the same token, the governing parties refused to introduce an automatic right to stay for asylum seekers after a longer period. FPÖ and BZÖ, which feared ‘uncontrolled immigration’ in such a case, assisted them. The restrictive course was largely supported by the public: opinion polls revealed that 48 per cent of the people did not approve an automatic right to stay for asylum seekers after five years; only 37 per cent were in favour (<i>Der Standard</i>, 20 October 2007). Instead, the SPÖ and ÖVP announced they would proceed with their preparations to establish an Asylum Court in order to speed up asylum procedures (see <b>Institutional changes</b> above).
         </p>
         
         <p>In order to reduce the number of cases of hardship in immigration and asylum matters, the Constitutional Court announced later in the year a catalogue of seven criteria that the authorities have to consider before deporting foreigners (the duration of residence, the existence and intensity of family life, the degree of integration, criminal integrity, bonds to the home country, private and family life at the time of an already insecure residence status, requirements of public order). On the basis of these criteria, the Court decided that the famous Arigona was not entitled to a residence permit, whereupon Minister Platter declared that he would not use his prerogative and allow her to stay for humanitarian reasons. The Court also announced that the (often criticised) provision of the 2005 Residence Law, which obliges non‐European Union citizens married to Austrians to apply for residence from their home country, was regarded as unproblematic. A study by the Brussels‐based Migration Integration Policy Group, published at the end of the year, confirmed that Austria exercises one of the most restrictive immigration and asylum regimes in Europe; it had no impact on public debate, however.</p>
         
         <p>In June, the Nationalrat elected new members of the Ombudman Board (<i>Volksanwaltschaft</i>). According to the Constitution, the three ombudspersons are elected for a term of six years, on the basis of proposals by the three strongest parties in the chamber. The first two positions went to the SPÖ (Peter Kostelka, incumbent ombudsman and former chairman of the party's parliamentary group) and the ÖVP (Maria Fekter, former MP and chairwoman of the committee of justice). The third position was claimed both by Greens and the FPÖ as both parties had received 21 seats in the 2006 general elections (the Greens had won 532 votes more than the FPÖ, though). The FPÖ contested the Greens' claim – all the more so because the latter had nominated their speaker for human rights (Terezija Stoisits) for the position; the FPÖ wanted to prevent the office from being turned into an ‘asylum consulting centre for Nigerian drug dealers and Islamic hate preachers’ (<i>Der Standard</i>, 24 March 2007). However, the President of the Nationalrat, after consulting parliament's legal service and two external constitutional experts, assigned the third position to the Greens. The three candidates were elected with a majority of SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens; an FPÖ appeal to the Constitutional Court was unsuccessful.
         </p>
         
         <p>No solution was found in the case of the bilingual (German and Slovenian) local signs in the province of Carinthia (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 889–890). Chancellor Gusenbauer had announced a solution, but Provincial Governor and BZÖ Chairman Jörg Haider continued to ignore the Constitutional Court, which, in several rulings since 2001, had demanded that bilingual local signs be erected in all mixed districts with a share of at least 10 per cent of Slovenian population. Haider rejected Gusenbauer's proposal to erect a total of 163 local signs (91 were already in place, Haider could imagine 102 at the most, 270 would have been necessary on the basis of the Constitutional Court's rulings and the recent census; <i>Der Standard</i>, 26 June 2007). Although the situation was embarrassing with respect to the principle of the rule of law, the SPÖ did not dare to take further action against him. The ÖVP, whose consent would have been necessary for a constitutional amendment, declared it was the Chancellery that was responsible for the matter.
         </p>
         
         <p>Relations with the European Union (EU) were once again dominated by the issue of foreign students attending Austrian universities, above all to study medicine (see <span title=""><a href="#b6" id="#b6R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fallend 2007</a></span>: 885–886). The European Commission announced it would appeal to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to lift the quota system reserving 75 per cent of all places to Austrian students as a violation of the non‐discrimination principle. When Chancellor Gusenbauer threatened to bring the issue onto the agenda of the Lisbon EU summit, which was actually reserved for the signing of the ‘reform treaty’, President of the EU Commission José Manuel Barroso stepped back (in spite of heavy internal criticism). He offered a moratorium of five years in the case, during which the Austrian government should supply new data to underpin its arguments (the government feared that unrestricted access for all foreign students would endanger medical supply in Austria as most of them would return to their home country after their study). The Ministry of Science was not satisfied with the solution because it had already submitted 500 pages of documents to the Commission and because it preferred the issue to be solved in the treaty.
