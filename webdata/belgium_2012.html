         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12002-sec-0003-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Most issues in Belgian politics were genuinely national, driven by the political reform agenda of the federal government or events that struck the nation as a whole, such as the coach accident in Sierre (Switzerland) or the closure of major plants of multinational companies (e.g., Ford Genk in Flanders and Arcelor‐Mittal in the Liège Region, with tens of thousands of job losses), for which neither the federal nor the regional governments had a remedy.</p>
         
         <p>The Flemish executive (Christian Democrats, Socialists and NV‐A) was destabilised by the lack of consensus on major public works initiatives and educational reforms. However, the Flemish political agenda was mainly determined by the preparation, results and impact of the 14 October local elections, which acted as a kind of mid‐term elections and which resulted in another landslide for the right‐wing independentist NV‐A – the largest Flemish opposition party at the federal level. The Flemish Liberals and Christian Democrats participating in the Di Rupo Government were an easy victim for the attacks of the NV‐A. They were initially lukewarm in their defence of the federal government's reforms, but later adopted a more affirmative style with the passing of the law splitting the Brussels‐Halle‐Vilvoorde constituency, which had been a demand of the Flemish‐nationalist movement for decades.</p>
         
         <p>In Flanders the agenda became entirely focused on the 14 October local elections when NV‐A party leader B. De Wever announced in April that he would run for the position of mayor of Antwerp, Flanders' largest city and a Socialist stronghold. It was the start of a presidential campaign throughout Flanders. The NV‐A managed to recruit many local incumbents, mainly from the Liberals and the extreme‐right wing Vlaams Belang, with the latter causing some concerns about the immigrant position of the NV‐A. This was the only party to conduct a campaign on national issues (i.e., in opposition to the Di Rupo Government), with De Wever figuring on every local election poster and pamphlet. As in the general election of June 2010, about three out of ten Flemish voted NV‐A, which allowed the party to access many local executives, including De Wever becoming mayor of Antwerp (in a coalition with the CD&amp;V and the Open VLD). In some NV‐A‐led communes, coalition agreements caused some concern because they include law and order, anti‐migrant, anti‐Francophone and anti‐Belgian policies.</p>
         
         <p>The local elections did not cause any big surprises as they confirmed the trends witnessed in the federal elections of 13 June 2010 (Rihoux et al. <span><a href="#epdy12002-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 913–918). In the French‐speaking community the PS confirmed its leading position, particularly in the Walloon region. In the Flemish‐speaking community, however, if the coalition parties generally held their own or declined slightly, the opposition party Groen! made some progress, while the extreme right‐wing Vlaams Belang continued to crumble. The communist PvdA/PTB's significant progress in the north and the south of the country was also worthy of note.
         </p>
         
         <p>The outcome of the local elections produced some party leadership changes. When the VLD vice‐prime minister in the federal government, V. Van Quickenborne, managed unexpectedly to oust the Christian Democrats from power in his city (Kortrijk), his cabinet seat was taken by the incumbent VLD party leader A. De Croo. The party organised a campaign to elect a new party president. The election was won on 8 December by G. Rutten, the candidate of the party establishment, who obtained 59.42 per cent of the membership vote.</p>
         
         <p>B. Valkeniers, president of Vlaams Belang, which lost about two‐thirds of its votes at the local elections (mainly to the NV‐A), resigned. The party council gave a narrow majority of 55.4 per cent to one of the party's founding fathers, G. Annemans, and a 92.1 per cent vote by the membership confirmed his leadership position on 16 December.</p>
         
         <p>By contrast, on the francophone side, the leadership remained stable in most parties during that year. The only exception is Ecolo, in which the co‐presidency switched on 4 March from the duo of charismatic leader J‐M. Javaux and S. Turine to a new tandem of O. Deleuze and E. Hoyos. Ecolo's statutes require that the two co‐presidents be from two different genders and two different regions (Brussels and Wallonia).</p>
         
         <p>In terms of substantive policy issues, as in 2011 the social climate continued to be riven by tensions. On 30 January, the general strike organised by the three major trade unions in protest against the government's austerity measures was generally observed – more clearly so in Wallonia and Brussels. Around mid‐February the government maintained its commitment to an increase in retirement age but agreed to some adjustments to make the reform more incremental.</p>
         
         <p>On 23 October the coalition reached an agreement to respect its budget commitments <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> the EU and to bring the deficit back to 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The requested cuts of €811 million were coupled with economic and employment incentive measures. Measures of degressivity of unemployment benefits entered into force on 1 November. They implied significant cuts after one year of unemployment.
         </p>
         
         <p>On 13 July the splitting of the Brussels‐Halle‐Vilvoorde bilingual electoral district was adopted by the lower house. This longstanding Flemish demand, which was part of the government agreement, was supported by the six coalition and the two ecologist parties, while the Flemish NV‐A, Vlaams Belang and the francophone FDF voted against it.</p>
         
         <p>On 17 April the coalition approved the reduction of the numbers of judicial districts from 27 to 12. They now correspond to the ten provinces, plus the Brussels Region and the German‐speaking community.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, in terms of demography, by the end of the year Belgium passed the 11 million inhabitants threshold.</p>
