         <p>Despite the election debacle of 1998 (the party's worst performance in a parliamentary election since the 1920s), the Social Democratic Party stayed in office as a single‐party minority government due to parliamentary support from the Left and Green parties. Against most expectations, and despite a number of difficult budget negotiations, the cooperation pact survived the entire four‐year parliamentary term. This appeared to vindicate the leadership of the Prime Minister and Social Democratic leader since 1996, Göran Persson. For several years, his personal popularity ratings had been very low, but they improved in 2001 and he entered the 2002 campaign as the country's most popular party leader. His party also improved its poll ratings, regularly topping 40 per cent in the first few months of 2002. The party's ratings started to decline again in the summer, but there was not much to suggest that the non‐socialist opposition bloc would achieve a majority.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>The election campaign was relatively eventful. In particular, attention was paid to issues related to immigration and ethnic integration. In August, the leader of the People's Party Liberals, Lars Leijonborg, presented an integration policy programme that led to an intense debate. The proposals included a language test as a criterion for Swedish citizenship (such a criterion had existed until 1980), and an opening up for labour immigration, something that the Social Democratic Government opposed. The programme did not contain any xenophobic rhetoric and was not particularly radical by international standards, but it did convey an image of toughness, which was somewhat unfamiliar for a party traditionally known for its tolerant outlook. Leijonborg openly dissuaded racists from voting for his party, but critics argued that the integration programme had an ‘us and them’ approach to immigration and integration, and Prime Minister Persson accused Leijonborg of ‘fishing in troubled waters’. However, the proposals appeared to go down well with the voters. The People's Party Liberals started to rise sharply in the polls after the integration policy programme was launched. The image of toughness, or clarity, was reinforced in other policy areas like education, where the party argued for stricter school discipline.</p>
         
         <p>Immigration and integration was put even higher on the agenda the week before the election, when a television documentary exposed a number of prominent local politicians as xenophobes. A team of investigative journalists, one posing as a xenophobic voter, travelled around the country. When making anti‐immigration statements to local campaigners, the journalist received varying degrees of sympathy and agreement, and only occasional rebuttals. The conversations were caught on a hidden camera. Most major parties featured negatively to some extent, but the journalists claimed that, overall, the Moderate Party had been the most sympathetic to the xenophobic impostor.</p>
         
         <p>While immigration and integration received much attention in the media, more traditional issues played a key part in the campaign on the ground. An exit poll taken by Swedish Television on election day indicated that immigration was only the twelfth most important issue to voters. Education was the most important issue area, followed by health care, the economy, and care of the elderly and children. The economy was subjected to extra attention when reports published during the campaign warned that the Government's expenditure limit would be broken unless quick and decisive steps were taken. The People's Party Liberals responded by withdrawing election promises amounting to SEK11 billion (11 billion), but the Social Democratic Minister of Finance, Bosse Ringholm, claimed that the Government had disproved pessimistic projections before. The signs of an economic decline were not strong enough to seriously unsettle the Government during the campaign, although they were reinforced towards the end of the year.</p>
         
         <p>The balance of power between the two main blocs remained almost unchanged. The ‘Government bloc’, consisting of the Social Democrats, Left Party and the Greens, made a net gain of one seat, while the four‐party Opposition bloc made a corresponding loss. Within the blocs, however, there were significant changes. For the Social Democrats, the gain of 3.5 percentage points and 13 seats was a relief. Opinion polls during the campaign indicated that the party was in danger of slipping down to a level similar to 1998. However, the party made a late surge and nearly reached 40 per cent. Historically, this was not a particularly outstanding result for a party that was never below 42 per cent in a parliamentary election between 1936 and 1988. Still, the gain compared to 1998 contrasted with a general decline for Social Democratic parties across Europe, not least sister parties in Norway and Denmark. It was also the first time since 1968 that the party gained votes as incumbents. The relative success owed much to the personal popularity of Göran Persson. He gained stature and credibility during the Swedish European Union (EU) presidency in 2001, and also benefited from his quick and decisive support for action against terrorism after the attack on New York on 11 September 2001. The result vindicated his campaign strategy, which was to play the role of statesman, not getting deeply involved in arguments with other parties.</p>
         
         <p>The Social Democratic gain was almost identically mirrored by the Left Party's loss. Indeed, the Swedish Television exit poll indicated that the vast majority of the Left Party's lost votes went directly to the Social Democrats. The increased popularity of Persson was one reason, possibly exacerbated by a speech by Left Party leader Gudrun Schyman in January in which she compared the situation for women in Sweden to the oppression of women under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. This gave her something of an extremist tag, despite the fact that she had played a key part in her party's reorientation away from communism, and taken the party to an unprecedented position of legitimacy and influence via its cooperation with the Social Democrats. Despite the loss, the Left Party's result should also be seen in historical context. In many previous elections, the party had to rely on tactical support from Social Democratic voters to clear the 4 per cent representational threshold. It now appears to have made permanent inroads into new groups of voters.</p>
         
         <p>The Green Party's gain of one seat was something of an achievement. Several polls in 2001 and 2002 had the party below the crucial 4 per cent level and, in late January 2002, the two spokespersons, Matz Hammarström (male) and Lotta Nilsson Hedström (female), announced their resignation. The process to find successors in time for the party congress in May was quite chaotic, and there was still uncertainty when the congress started. A proposal to change the leadership structure from two spokespersons into a system with one main spokesperson and two deputy spokespersons fell 13 votes short of the required two‐thirds majority. The two spokespersons elected by the congress, Peter Eriksson (male) and Maria Wetterstrand (female), were largely unknown to the public. However, they settled quickly into their positions and the campaign was considered a success for both. In particular, the 28 year‐old Wetterstrand earned widespread respect for her media performances.</p>
         
         <p>The opposition parties had one big winner and one big loser. The winner was the People's Party Liberals, which came close to trebling its number of seats. The result was remarkable, as the party had looked in danger of losing its parliamentary status until the summer. The leader since 1997, Lars Leijonborg, was subjected to severe internal criticism in 2001. However, he managed to unite the party and his initiative on immigration and integration (see above) gave him new momentum. However, the 2002 success, significant though it was, does not necessarily mean that the party will be able to hold on to its newly acquired support. With few core voters, the People's Party Liberals has a history of big gains, as well as heavy losses.</p>
         
         <p>The biggest loss was suffered by the Moderate Party. It remained the second biggest party in the country, a position it has held since 1979, but the party lost one‐third of its seats and the gap between it and other parties was significantly reduced. Bo Lundgren, Moderate leader since 1999, is considered competent, but technocratic and lacking in charisma. Among other things, he was criticised for putting too much emphasis on tax cuts in the campaign. The party also seemed to suffer from compromising statements made by some of its local representatives in the above‐mentioned television broadcast. Lundgren questioned the journalistic method used in the documentary, but also demanded the resignation of the embarrassed party representatives. However, the documentary was aired five days before the election, which meant that it was too late for the party to repair the damage. The disappointing result led to an immediate inquest. Already on election night, Tove Lifvendahl, chair of the party's youth organisation, demanded a clearout of the party leadership. In the next few weeks, several senior party officials resigned. At an extra party congress held in November, the national executive was significantly renewed. Bo Lundgren stayed as leader, but his position was not regarded as safe.</p>
         
         <p>The Christian Democrats also lost ground but, as leader Alf Svensson pointed out on election night, it was also the second best result in the history of the party. Meanwhile, the Centre Party's gain of four seats secured the position of Maud Olofsson, who was appointed leader in 2001 (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>). Olofsson is regarded as charismatic, and some expected that she would be the star of the 2002 campaign, but she was somewhat overshadowed by the rejuvenated Leijonborg. Overall, the result meant that the same seven parties have been in the <i>Riksdag</i> since 1994. The biggest party outside the <i>Riksdag</i> was the anti‐immigration Sweden Democrats, who received 1.4 per cent of the vote. This was a substantial increase compared to 1998.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Cabinet report</h2>
         
         <p>A number of minor cabinet changes took place early in 2002. Jan O. Karlsson, who in November 2001 was appointed Minister for Immigration and Foreign Aid in place of Maj‐Inger Klingvall (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>), took office on 7 January. Just over a week later, the Minister for Schools and Basic Education, Ingegerd Wärnersson, resigned. She was regarded as politically weak, and it was generally assumed that she had effectively been sacked. No newcomer was brought in to fill her place. Instead Thomas Östros, the Minister for Education, had his remit extended to cover Wärnersson's portfolio. It was also announced that the Minister for the Environment, Kjell Larsson, would go on temporary leave for cancer treatment. Lena Sommestad, a professor in economic history, was appointed in his place and stayed on when Larsson returned in early April.
         </p>
         
         <p>During the campaign, Göran Persson declared that he was asking the electorate for a mandate to continue as a single‐party government. After the election, however, this turned out to be somewhat complicated. The Green Party demanded cabinet posts to continue supporting a Social Democratic Government. This was refused by the Social Democrats. Instead, the Greens participated in negotiations with the Christian Democrats, the People's Party Liberals and the Centre Party, with a view to forming a centre‐green minority government, which would be tolerated by the Moderate Party. These negotiations fell apart when they were abandoned by the Centre Party, but they showed that the Green Party was determined not to sell itself cheaply and that it is not exclusively a left‐leaning party. Subsequently, however, negotiations between the Social Democrats and the Left and Green parties were resumed.</p>
         
         <p>The Swedish Constitution does not require a government to resign after an election. However, a motion of no‐confidence was tabled by the Moderate Party when the new <i>Riksdag</i> first met on 30 September. The vote took place on 2 October. The motion of no‐confidence received 158 votes, which was 17 short of the 175 required to unseat the Government. The Green Party, whose votes would have been enough to force the Government to resign, had threatened to vote with the Opposition. However, this threat was withdrawn the night before the vote, when an agreement was reached between the Social Democrats and the Greens. Instead, the Green Party abstained in the vote, which in the Swedish constitutional context means passive support for the Government. A few days later, the agreement was extended to include the Left Party, which had never threatened to vote against the Government.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Left and Green parties did not receive cabinet posts, but were each given eight observation posts in different ministries. The Social Democrats were also forced into a number of policy concessions, including a unilateral ban on Swedish cod fishing (this was abandoned in early 2003, when it was found to be incompatible with EU regulations) and a trial of traffic congestion charges in Stockholm. The latter concession was problematical, as it is a local government matter and the Social Democrats in Stockholm had pledged not to introduce congestion charges during the 2002–2006 period. Thus, in order to live up to the cooperation deal, the Social Democratic Government forced its representatives on the Stockholm City Council to break a local election promise. The cooperation deal will be subject to a ‘mid‐term review’ in 2004, and is by no means certain to last the entire election period.</p>
         
         <p>After the renewal of the cooperation pact, Göran Persson reshuffled the Government on 21 October. The changes were quite significant, with six departures, eight new appointments and four changes of portfolio. Two of the departures could be described as dismissals. Britta Lejon was considered to have failed in her, admittedly unenviable, mission to deliver democratic renewal and increased voter turnout. Björn Rosengren officially resigned for private reasons. However, there were reports that he resigned after having refused an offer of the post of Minister of Defence. Rosengren was considered to be sharp and charismatic, but had let himself down with a number of careless statements. It was also alleged that he was considered to have few concrete achievements to show from his time as Minister for Industry, Employment and Communications. The other departures were uncontroversial. Kjell Larsson was forced to retire due to a recurrence of his cancer. He died on 21 December. Björn von Sydow retired as Minister of Defence to become Speaker of the <i>Riksdag</i>. Lena Hjelm‐Wallén and Ingela Thalén retired without controversy, both having served in Social Democratic Governments for many years.
         </p>
         
         <p>Several of the new names were unknown to the public; in some cases, they had not even been predicted by experienced commentators. Pär Nuder, the new Minister for Government Integration, was effectively promoted within the Government organisation. Although never before in the cabinet, he had extensive experience, having worked for Göran Persson, as well as for Persson's predecessor, Ingvar Carlsson. The new Minister of Defence, Leni Björklund, was previously general secretary of the Church of Sweden. Other new ministers included Ann‐Christin Nykvist, who took over the Ministry of Agriculture, and Gunnar Lund, who was appointed Deputy Minister of Finance with special responsibility for the EMU entry process. Ulrica Messing, considered by some to be a rising star, did not change ministries, but saw her responsibilities changed to include infrastructure and regional development. Mona Sahlin was moved to the Ministry of Justice, where her responsibilities include ethnic integration, democracy and sport.</p>
         
         <p>Four open EMU sceptics remained in the Government. Leif Pagrotsky was moved to take over the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications from the departing Rosengren; the former Minister of Agriculture, Margareta Winberg, became Deputy Prime Minister; Marita Ulvskog stayed as Minister of Culture; and Lena Sommestad took charge of the Ministry of the Environment. One of the newcomers, the Minister for Public Health and Social Services, Morgan Johansson, is also regarded as an EMU sceptic. On the whole, the changes were not interpreted as a major political or ideological reorientation. The new Government contained 22 ministers, 10 of whom were women. The average age went down from 51 to 48, compared to the situation immediately before the reshuffle.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Beyond what has been discussed in connection with the election report, two issues were of particular significance in 2002. As reported in the previous edition of the <i>Political Data Yearbook</i>, the Government initiated discussions in late 2000 with the other parties to revise the Swedish security policy. On 13 February 2002, the Government presented a revised security policy doctrine in its foreign policy declaration to the <i>Riksdag</i>. The new doctrine states that Sweden keeps its commitment to peacetime non‐alignment, thus staying outside all military alliances. However, the doctrine also indicates a weakened commitment to wartime neutrality, with the statement that neutrality ‘has served us well’. As well as the governing Social Democratic Party, the new doctrine was supported by the Moderate, Christian Democratic and Centre parties.
         </p>
         
         <p>The People's Party Liberals had abandoned the preceding party negotiations at an early stage, demanding an opening for full North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) membership. The Left and Green parties were also critical, but for the opposite reason, arguing that Swedish policy was becoming too closely linked to NATO and the United States. Later in the year, the Moderate Party explicitly stated that NATO membership should not be ruled out. Thus, parliamentary support for the new doctrine was reduced within a few months.</p>
         
         <p>The EMU issue was on the agenda throughout the year, although it was not a central feature of the 2002 election campaign. On 29 November, the parliamentary parties agreed that a referendum on EMU membership will be held on Sunday, 14 September 2003. Formally, the referendum will be consultative, but it would not be politically possible for any government to act against the result. The outcome of the referendum became increasingly difficult to predict towards the end of 2002. Until the summer, opinion polls indicated clear pro‐EMU majorities; in some cases, the difference was around 20 percentage points. However, the gap narrowed during the autumn and some polls indicated narrow pluralities against EMU membership in November and December. This went against predictions that Swedes would grow more EMU‐positive after having experienced the euro in practice during the summer holidays.</p>
         
         <p>A particular cause of concern for the Government was that the polls indicated anti‐EMU majorities among Social Democratic voters. The Social Democratic Party's national council, which consists of 120 regional representatives, decided in November that Sweden's self‐imposed criteria for EMU membership had been met. The decision was taken by a large majority, but was not unanimous. Indeed, as mentioned above, five members of Persson's new Government have expressed varying degrees of EMU scepticism. Thus, the EMU issue can prove problematic for the Social Democratic leadership.</p>
         
         <p>The Swedish economy grew compared to 2001, but appeared to slow down towards the end of the year. The main budget, presented to the <i>Riksdag</i> on 8 October, still showed signs of the pre‐election optimism, and stuck to earlier promises of increased parental benefits and study allowances, and more money to child care. A narrow budget surplus was projected for 2002, but deficits were expected for 2003 and 2004. The national debt was projected to remain relatively stable in absolute terms at just above SEK1,100 billion (1120 billion), but would still decline relative to GDP (gross domestic product) to under 50 per cent in 2003. According to a report published in March 2003 by the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER), GDP grew by 1.9 per cent in 2002. This was 0.8 percentage points higher than in 2001, but the NIER projected a decline to 1.4 per cent for 2003.
         </p>
         
         <p>There were also indications that the steady decline in unemployment since the mid‐1990s was coming to an end. According to statistics from the Swedish National Labour Market Administration, the annual average unemployment for 2002 was 4.2 per cent of the workforce, with a further 2.6 per cent involved in labour market schemes. This was a marginal decline compared to 2001, but the Government's target of 80 per cent of the population between 20 and 64 years of age being in employment by 2004 seemed unachievable. For 2002, the NIER estimated the percentage at 78.1 per cent, and projected that it would decline in the next few years. A related problem, which was subject to increasing debate, was the high level of sick leave, which put the unemployment figures in a slightly different light.</p>
         
         <p>Inflation declined somewhat, and stayed within the <i>Riksbanken’s</i> (central bank) target of 2 per cent, with a tolerance level of ±1 percentage point. Inflation was also below the overall rate in the EU as well as EMU. According to Statistics Sweden, the monthly Consumer Price Index varied between 1.9 and 2.9 per cent, with an average of 2.4 per cent.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Institutional changes</h2>
         
         <p>Sweden has a total of four constitutional laws: the Instrument of Government, the Act of Succession, the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. These laws are relatively often subject to amendments. In many cases, the changes are of a minor and/or technical nature, and have therefore not always been reported in the <i>Political Data Yearbook</i>. On 20 November 2002, however, the <i>Riksdag</i> decided on an amendment to the Instrument of Government that changed the relations between Sweden and the EU. It was the second confirmatory vote, with the first vote having taken place in June. The changes involved a total of six amendments, two of which were politically controversial. The first was to make it possible for the <i>Riksdag</i> to ratify EU framework decisions, even if the framework is not finalised. The second was an extension of the number of issues where decisions can be transferred from the <i>Riksdag</i> to EU institutions. Previously, such transfers could only involve European Community‐related matters, such as trade and agriculture. The requirement for a <i>Riksdag</i> decision by a three‐quarters majority, or two identical decisions with an election between them, remained. The amendment also stated that matters concerning human rights and freedoms referred to elsewhere in the Instrument of Government, laws regulating elections and rules regulating constitutional changes could not be transferred. All six changes were decided in a bloc vote, which was carried by a large majority. The Left and Green parties voted against, and there were also individual dissenters in the Centre, Christian Democratic and Social Democratic parties. The changes were seen by many as preparation for future proposals expected by the Convention on the Future of Europe.
