         <p>The debt crisis, which by 2012 had become a severe economic recession and unemployment crisis, remained the overriding issue in Greece during 2012. The country retained worldwide importance and attention, primarily because of the political uncertainty and ‘Grexit’ scenarios – a term coined in 2012 referring to the possibility of Greece leaving the eurozone. Financial markets held their breath during the parliamentary votes, the two national elections and the multiple attempts to form a government by Greek political elites. The fears were linked to the systemic risks that negative developments in the future of the Greek bail‐out package and Greece's relationship with the ‘troika’ (International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12012-bib-0047" id="#epdy12012-bib-0047R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">European Commission</a></span>) could bring about for other European economies and their banking sectors.
         </p>
         
         <p>The path of internal devaluation – involving austerity measures such as reducing expenditures, increasing taxes and cutting wages and pensions – that was chosen as the way out of the crisis by the troika and ruling political elites in Greece led to a much deeper economic recession, a higher unemployment rate and higher inflation than expected by the creditors. These developments, coupled with the problems in the Greek banking sector and the flight of capital, dried up liquidity in the Greek market and made it difficult for even solvent businesses to get bank loans or attract investments. This in turn hit the real economy through lay‐offs and company bankruptcies. Two of the country's largest companies – Coca Cola Hellenic and dairy giant FAGE – decided to move their operational headquarters to Switzerland and Luxembourg, respectively. Consumer spending power declined and the crisis deepened.</p>
         
         <p>On 9 February Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, heading the grand coalition government backed by ND, PASOK and – up to that point – LAOS, reached an agreement between the two main coalition parties on yet another battery of austerity terms (involving €13 billion in spending cuts and layoffs in the public sector as well as tax increases) for a second loan agreement of about €130 billion with the troika. These measures passed on 12 February but not without some important political fallout. In the 300‐seat parliament only 278 voted and the measures passed with 199 in favour, 74 against and five abstaining. The vote took place while 40 buildings were burning across Athens and thousands were protesting outside the parliament. This vote over the austerity measures that were required to secure the second bail‐out decimated the parties of the grand coalition. A total of 45 MPs were expelled from their parties: 22 from PASOK, 21 from ND and two from LAOS. These included one deputy minister and three vice‐ministers, who left their posts after refusing to vote in favour of the austerity measures. Makis Vorides and Adonis Georgiades, both LAOS MPs – minister and vice‐minister, respectively, in the Papademos Government – voted in favour of the measures contrary to their party's line, resigned from their ministerial posts, and a few days later joined ND. Vorides remained in his post, while Georgiades' position remained vacant.</p>
         
         <p>As a result of the austerity measures that the Papademos Government passed in early February, the eurozone ministers agreed on a €130 billion bail‐out by 21 February and decided on measures that would reduce Greece's debt to 120.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020. But the roller‐coaster continued since, despite the deal that was reached by the eurozone ministers, it remained to be seen how the private creditors would react to the Private Sector Involvement (PSI) deal that was part of the overall attempt to reduce Greece's debt. If the private sector did not opt in, then this process could have derailed the second bail‐out plan and precipitated an uncontrolled default followed by a ‘Grexit’ since two Greek bonds worth €14.5 billion were due to mature on 20 March.</p>
         
         <p>On 9 March a bond swap deal with private creditors prevented this scenario from materialising and allowed the Greek government to continue with the bail‐out plan and cut its debt by more than €100 billion. The deal had other parameters as well, such as the extension of maturities and the lowering of interest rates. These parameters were crucial because they significantly changed the country's debt profile and reduced the financing needs for the following years. However, the second bail‐out plan has been heavily criticised. For example, about 11,000 Greeks saw about 74 per cent of their investments in Greek bonds dissipate into thin air through the debt‐restructuring programme. The impact of this bond swap deal was also detrimental to Cypriot banks and ultimately obliged the Cypriot government to negotiate its own bail‐out plan. With the PSI agreement completed, the road for Evangelos Venizelos – at the time Minister of Finance – to become chairman of PASOK was now open. Venizelos ran unopposed and took over the leadership of the party from George Papandreou.</p>
         
         <p>Despite the spending cuts, tax hikes and other austerity measures, the public debt – that had nominally declined as a result of the PSI – continued to increase because of the recession. The state budget continued to have a primary deficit – though declining – due largely to a deeper than expected recession which affected state revenues from value‐added tax (VAT) and other taxes, but also the inability to tame government spending. About half of the households in Greece could not pay their taxes and/or repay their bank loans and credit cards. By the beginning of 2012 overall unemployment was above 20 per cent and by the end of the year it had reached 26 per cent, with youth unemployment reaching 55 per cent. According to the statistics provided by the Ministry of Public Order and Citizens' Protection, suicides were up from the beginning of the crisis in 2009 and the sad trend continued in 2012 – the most symbolic of these being the case of 77‐year‐old retired pharmacist Dimitris Christoulas, who shot himself in broad daylight across from the parliament. Incidents of depression and the use of anti‐depressants were also up according to the Research University Institute of Mental Health in Athens; and thousands of people became homeless – something hitherto foreign to contemporary Greeks. Crime increased, especially burglaries, and terrorism persisted.</p>
         
         <p>Illegal immigration remained one of the most important issues with recent data showing that over 100,000 immigrants had been crossing the country's sea and land borders every year – the majority coming through Turkey. The Minister of Public Order and Citizens' Protection, Nikos Dendias, initiated an operation in August – ironically called ‘Xenios Zeus’ or ‘Hospitable Zeus’ – which involved rounding up suspected illegal immigrants and holding them in detention camps before deportation. But this operation was heavily criticised as discriminatory by nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) and human rights organisations. In addition to ‘Xenios Zeus’, border patrols were bolstered and the number of patrol boats were also significantly increased.</p>
         
         <p>All of this took place under a ‘government with a special task’ (Mavrogordatos &amp; Mylonas <span title=""><a href="#epdy12012-bib-0046" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12012-bib-0046R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 127) and an opposition that was often in the streets disputing its legitimacy to negotiate with the troika or questioning its ability to do so. Scandals broke out repeatedly, with the most visible ones being the arrest of former Defence Minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos on charges of receiving bribes for the purchase of submarines and money laundering; the Proton Bank embezzlement scandal; the €12 million deficit in the Greek National Tourism Organization's (EOT) accounts; the scandal involving former Mayor of Thessaloniki Vassilis Papageorgopoulos and many of his close associates charged with the embezzlement of more than €50 million from the municipality's coffers; the discovery of 46,000 fraudulent pension claims; and the ‘Lagarde list’ scandal involving the failure to investigate the names of some 2,000 Greeks who held accounts amounting to €1.5 billion at the Geneva branch of HSBC bank for possible tax evasion as well as accusations against the former Minister of Finance, Giorgos Papakonstantinou, for tampering with the list.
         </p> 
         <p>In 2012, however, we also saw the continuation and further development of citizens' initiatives such as groups of producers trying to bypass intermediaries and sell their agricultural products directly to the consumers. The Greek Orthodox Church, the Municipality of Athens, as well as many volunteer organisations collected everything from medicine to clothes, sorted them and distributed them to those in need. These efforts were all signs of solidarity among the citizens. Finally, important signs of an emerging start‐up culture propagating the centrality of entrepreneurship, innovation and export‐oriented projects became visible.</p>

         <p>With the bond swap successfully concluded and the Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece approved in Brussels on 14 March, the Papademos Government achieved its special task and thus the Prime Minister announced elections for 6 May. Parliament was dissolved on 9 April. Campaigning, blame games and government inactivity characterised the period from April to late June. This delayed the implementation of the programme and the disbursement of the next tranches of the loan, with detrimental effects for the economy.</p>
         
         <p>The 6 May election was shattering for the post‐dictatorship party system, which since 1974 had been dominated by PASOK and ND. Together they garnered only 32 per cent of the vote. Even more surprising was SYRIZA's second place with 16.8 per cent of the vote. Less unexpected was the electoral success of Independent Hellenes (10.6 per cent) on the right and Golden Dawn on the far right (7 per cent). Greeks voted against austerity measures and a two‐party system that could no longer fulfill its side of the ‘patronage contract’. Yet, they voted – at least nominally – in favour of a European future. The May elections also made clear that the existing electoral law produced odd and hardly representative results. For instance, ND received two percentage points more than SYRIZA but the electoral bonus for the winning party gave ND 56 more seats. Moreover, as a result of fragmentation of the party system and the 3 per cent threshold in place, parties that did not make it to the parliament collectively received a higher percentage than the first party (19 per cent), which received 108 seats. These parties included: Popular Orthodox Rally‐LAOS, Democratic Alliance, DRASI‐Fileleftheri Symmachia (Action‐Liberal Alliance), Dimiourgia Xana (Recreate Greece), Social Agreement (Koinoniki Symfonia) and the Green Party (Oikologoi Prasinoi).</p> 
         <p>European leaders were stunned and waited to see whether a government could be formed. After a two‐week period political leaders were unable to form a coalition government. A new election was announced for 17 June, and a caretaker government was put in place under Panagiotis Pikramenos, hitherto President of the Council of State (supreme administrative court). The country was in a state of disarray during the one‐month period between elections. Nea Dimokratia (ND) cultivated the fear of Greece's exit from the eurozone if SYRIZA were to succeed. SYRIZA campaigned against the memorandum and tried to reverse the negative message asking for people to vote, ignoring ‘the politics of fear’. On 17 June Nea Dimokratia and SYRIZA both increased their vote shares by at least 10 per cent. However, due to the existing electoral law the first party receives a bonus of 50 seats and as result Nea Dimokratia held 129 seats in total and SYRIZA 71, although their vote difference was less than 3 per cent. This outcome and the exhaustion of Greek society enabled the creation of a coalition government by the pro‐Memorandum political forces. The government coalition, which is often denounced by opposition parties as the ‘Internal Troika’, included Nea Dimokratia and PASOK – once sworn enemies – and the left‐wing party DIMAR. Together they held 179 seats in the 300‐member parliament. The other four parties in the parliament remained hostile to the Memorandum and the austerity measures (SYRIZA – Coalition of the Radical Left, Independent Hellenes, Golden Dawn and KKE – Communist Party of Greece).</p>

         <p>On 21 June the new coalition government backed by ND, PASOK and DIMAR was sworn in and Antonis Samaras became Prime Minister. The cabinet was formed after the three parties agreed on a detailed common platform, which focused on renegotiating the terms of the bail‐out plan without jeopardising the country's position in the eurozone and more generally its future in the European Union. ND dominated the 39‐member cabinet (30 out of the 39 positions), which included a couple of technocrats nominated by DIMAR (the ministries of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights as well as that of Administrative Reform and e‐Governance). PASOK's President Venizelos decided not to nominate any of his party cadres for position in the cabinet despite voices from his party to do so, but the party did nominate three nominally nonpartisan ministers (Finance; Agricultural Development and Food; Environment, Energy and Climate Change). A total of 11 out of the 39 members are not MPs. It is also noteworthy that there is only one female minister and two women in total in the whole cabinet.</p>

         <p>The Greek political system was characterised by extreme volatility in 2012. PASOK dropped from 44 per cent in the 2009 election to a mere 12 per cent in the June election. More spectacular has been Golden Dawn's electoral fortune. One of the most extreme right‐wing parties in Europe, Golden Dawn skyrocketed from 0.3 per cent in 2009 to a stunning 7 per cent in the 2012 elections and third place among Greek parties in some later polls. More suggestive of the volatility is the fact that in less than a year, Greece had four different prime ministers: PASOK's former President George Papandreou, Lucas Papademos who led the first coalition government in 2011, Panagiotis Pikramenos who served as interim prime minister and led Greece to the June 2012 election, and the incumbent Antonis Samaras (President of ND). In 2012 we also observed a full transformation of Samaras from a proponent of the anti‐Memorandum bloc (Mavrogordatos &amp; Mylonas <span title=""><a href="#epdy12012-bib-0045" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12012-bib-0045R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 986) into the political figure spearheading the Memorandum forces. Three parties entered parliament for the first time (Democratic Left, Independent Hellenes and Golden Dawn) and many new faces were elected across all parties. In the liberal camp we saw three newly established political parties running in the May 2012 elections (Democratic Alliance, Recreate Greece and Drasi‐Liberal Alliance), receiving collectively approximately 8.5 per cent of the vote share. But due to the relatively even distribution of votes across these three options and the 3 per cent threshold in the Greek electoral law, not one of these liberal parties entered parliament. In the June election, Democratic Alliance was integrated into ND, while the other two liberal parties joined forces in the election but fell well short of 3 per cent. Finally, both elections were characterised by low voter turnout, yet another indicator of voters' exhaustion and the legitimacy crisis that the political system faced.
         </p>
         
         <p>A new round of negotiations between the new government and the troika took place from July to the end of November. European leaders' attitude went from negative to positive following a European campaign that Antonis Samaras launched. Stournaras's role as Finance Minister should not be underestimated since the European and International Monetary Fund officials knew and respected this technocrat. The most apparent sign of this change was the state visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her supportive message – despite the thousands of protesters against her in the streets. By the beginning of November the coalition government voted a four‐year austerity and reform package involving primarily spending cuts and, to a lesser extent tax rises (estimated at €13.5 billion). This package basically specified the measures that were not fully spelled out in February. Following the new austerity measures debate in November, former PASOK Minister of Health, Andreas Loverdos, announced his intention to found a new political movement and was immediately expelled from the party's parliamentary group. The once almighty PASOK was left with a mere 25 MPs and very low poll numbers.</p>
         
         <p>In late November, after many months of political turmoil in Greece and the troika's ambivalence about Greece's debt sustainability, eurozone ministers reached an agreement on the Greek debt, disbursed the overdue loan instalments and left room for future debt relief measures provided that Greece managed to sustain primary surpluses. As a result of this deal, Greece ended up with a much better set of loan terms, extension of maturities, interest deferral and lower interest rates than other EU Member States, as well as bank mergers and a mechanism for bank recapitalisation, but during the period of negotiation the country's economic recession further deepened.</p>
         
         <p>On 13 December the eurogroup went ahead with the second installment through the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for a total amount of €49 billion. Despite the stomach‐turning instability and prophecies of doom in 2012, the risk of Greece leaving the euro had diminished and the Greek government had managed to navigate the country towards an agreement with its lenders, laying the basis for the growing stabilisation (political, economic, social) that has marked 2013.</p>
