         <p>British politics in 2009 was dominated by two major issues: the MPs' expenses scandal and the continuing economic recession. The year also saw local and European elections in June, a failed attempt to oust Gordon Brown from the leadership of the Labour Party and a major cabinet reshuffle. The year came to an end with the Conservatives scoring around 40–41 per cent in most polls, similar to their position at the start of the year. Labour's position was slightly worse than in early 2009, with most polls placing them between the late twenties and early thirties in percentage terms. Support for the Liberal Democrats was slightly higher than at the start of the year, mainly in the 18–20 per cent bracket, although nowhere near the levels that were to follow in mid‐April 2010. Interestingly though, the level of support for ‘other’ parties reached comparatively high levels, especially around the European elections, and was still relatively high at 11–15 per cent in polls during December 2009.</p>
         
         <p>Labour's decline, and the rise in support for ‘others’, were at least partly accounted for by the expenses scandal. While some stories of MPs' use of parliamentary allowances made headlines in 2008 (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Fisher 2009</a></span>: 1137), in 2009 the leaking of details of MPs' expenses claims to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> sparked the biggest scandal to hit Parliament in many years. The first expenses stories of the year began to appear in February and March, and mainly concerned government ministers. The then Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, was the subject of reports in February that she had designated her sister's home in London as her main residence, with her family abode as her second residence on which she had claimed under the second home allowance. She was in the news again in March when it emerged that she had claimed, albeit unintentionally, for the costs of two pay‐per‐view adult movies purchased by her husband. Employment Minister Tony McNulty was reported to have claimed for a house in which his parents lived, not far from his own home.
         </p>
         
         <p>Gordon Brown attempted to close the issue down by broadcasting what became a rather infamous YouTube clip on 21 April in which, between smiles, he called for MPs to vote by the end of the next week on an interim system with the second home allowance being scrapped and replaced by a daily attendance payment. However, he failed to achieve cross‐party support for the measures, so while some changes were agreed on 30 April, the daily allowance proposal was dropped. These changes were to be temporary while MPs awaited publication of a report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life under Sir Christopher Kelly. Brown faced particular pressure at this point having lost a vote in Parliament (29 April) on a Liberal Democrat opposition day‐motion concerning the rights of Gurkhas (soldiers from Nepal who serve in the British army) to settle in the United Kingdom.</p>
         
         <p>The temperature in the expenses debate rose dramatically in May when the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which had obtained access to a database of claims, began publishing details of these on a daily basis. It is worth pointing out that in many of these cases MPs had not broken the rules governing the second home allowance (officially known as the ‘Additional Costs Allowance’), under which altering the property designated as an MP's second home was not prohibited, and mortgage interest, furnishings and maintenance, among other things, could be claimed. Nevertheless, reports referred to the process of ‘flipping’, where MPs had altered their designated second home from one property to another in order to make claims via the second home allowance on more than one property. Other stories saw some MPs accused of claiming for mortgages they had already finished paying. David Chaytor and Elliot Morely were both suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party on the basis of such allegations. Justice Minister Shahid Malik stood down from his position in government in May while his expenses claims were examined. He was cleared and returned the following month as a junior Communities Minister. Among the more eccentric requests for home improvements were the Conservative Sir Peter Viggers's claim for a floating duck house, and Douglas Hogg's claim for moat cleaning.
         </p>
         
         <p>As May drew on, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, came under increasing pressure from MPs to resign amid arguments that he had some responsibility for presiding over the system that allowed these sorts of claims to be made. In unprecedented scenes in Parliament on 18 May, a string of MPs spoke against the Speaker. On 19 May he agreed to stand down from his post by 21 June. He was the first Speaker of the House of Commons to be forced from office for over 300 years.</p>
         
         <p>Both the Conservatives and Labour saw their poll ratings fall as the scandal progressed, although polls generally showed the public thinking Cameron had dealt better with the crisis than Brown. The drop in ratings was bigger for Labour, with one poll of general election voting intentions in May placing them as low as 20 per cent. Among those benefitting was the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), ratings for which went up, mainly in European election voting intentions, but also in some polls of general election preferences. All of this contributed to a huge weakening of Brown's position in the run‐up to the European and local elections on 4 June.</p>
         
         <p>On 3 June, Hazel Blears, Minister for Communities and Local Government, resigned from the cabinet in what was seen as an attempt to undermine Brown's position, and rumours circulated of an email to be signed by numerous Labour backbenchers, calling for Brown to resign. The following day, on which the European and local elections were held, James Purnell, Work and Pensions Secretary resigned and asked Brown to ‘stand aside to give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election’. In the event, the alleged email signed by backbenchers did not surface and while several junior ministers stood down, none of the cabinet's senior figures joined the rebels and Brown survived. He was, however, restricted in the ensuing reshuffle: Alistair Darling remained Chancellor, for instance, despite rumours that the Prime Minister had wanted to move him from this post (details of other cabinet changes can be found in <a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink">Table 2</a>).

         <p>After less than a month in the legislative process, the Parliamentary Standards Act was agreed by MPs and Lords in July. It created a new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to oversee MPs' pay and allowances and to draw up a code of conduct regarding MPs' financial interests. A new criminal offence was created for MPs knowingly providing false information as part of a claim for an allowance. In early November, the expenses issue rose to the top of the agenda once again when the Kelly Report was released. It recommended that MPs should no longer be able to claim any support for paying mortgages and said MPs within reasonable commuting distance of Westminster should not be able to claim for a second home at all. The issue remained in the headlines during the autumn as Sir Thomas Legg, who had been appointed to look into all second home expenses claims during the Parliament, began writing a series of letters to MPs, many of which asked them to repay money claimed. Some MPs were critical of this on the basis that limits to spending under certain headings had been set retrospectively by Legg and because, as noted above, many MPs had not broken the rules in place at the time.</p>
         
         <p>The second major issue in British politics in 2009 was the economy. The year started with the financial crisis deepening. The United Kingdom hosted the G20 summit with Gordon Brown in the chair in London in early April. The members agreed a set of measures designed to reinvigorate the global economy, including a stimulus package with increases in money available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lend to troubled economies, stricter controls on bankers' pay and bonuses, and more regulation of hedge funds. The polls gave mixed answers to the question of whether Labour's popularity increased as a result of the summit. The budget, which had been postponed until after the G20 meeting, saw the introduction of a 50 per cent rate of tax on earnings above £150,000, a forecast that government debt would double to 79 per cent of GDP by 2013 and a prediction that the economy would shrink by 3.5 per cent in 2009. Conservative leader David Cameron, whose party received a poll boost in the aftermath of the budget, talked about a ‘Government of the living dead’. Things looked little better by the end of June when the OECD predicted that recovery in the United Kingdom would be slow, and worsened its projection for the decline in the size of the British economy during the year.</p>
         
         <p>Before MPs left for the summer recess, debate between the major parties shifted to the question of public spending cuts. This topic rarely left the agenda in the remainder of the year. Discussion was particularly intense when Chancellor Alastair Darling presented the Pre‐Budget Report in December, which crucially did not set out specific areas where public spending would be cut, but referred to the protection of frontline services. It included a 50 per cent tax on bank bonuses above £25,000, and a rise in national insurance contributions from April 2011 (something that was to feature heavily in the 2010 election campaign). By the third quarter of 2009, the British economy had declined for six consecutive quarters – the first time a recession of this length had been recorded since records began in 1955. Economic growth returned by the final quarter, but only at 0.4 per cent. By December, the gap in the polls between the two main parties was somewhat smaller than it had been in the height of the expenses scandal, leading to rumours that Brown might go for an early election in March 2010.</p>
         
         <p>In other major developments, the Lisbon Treaty was ratified in November, after which David Cameron set out his party's policy in response. This included proposals to repatriate some EU social policies, introduce a United Kingdom Sovereignty Bill and hold referenda on any further transfers of powers to the EU. The first public hearings in the Iraq Inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, began in November, although the most high profile witnesses were not to appear until 2010. Parliament passed the Political Parties and Elections Act in July, which gave the Electoral Commission the power to impose civil sanctions on those breaking electoral laws – a more subtle weapon than criminal prosecution, which was the only option available previously. It also required future donations to political parties to include a statement as to the source of the money, and established that donations above £7,500 can only be made by United Kingdom residents.</p>
         
         <p>In Scotland, the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution published its final report in June. While the option of independence for Scotland was not part of the Commission's remit, it made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the current situation. In particular, it recommended taking 10 pence in the pound off the standard and upper rates of income tax in Scotland and cutting the block grant from the British government correspondingly. In order to keep the rate the same as it was prior to the change, the Scottish Parliament would have to make a decision to do this, with the aim being to increase the accountability of the Scottish Executive and Parliament for money spent in Scotland. The report also recommended devolving power over Scottish elections, rules on airguns, and drink‐driving and national speed limits. In November, the Scottish National Party published a White Paper on the constitutional future of Scotland entitled <i>Your Scotland, Your Voice: A National Conversation</i>. It set out several options including no change, implementing the recommendations of the Calman Commission, ‘full devolution’ in which more domestic policy‐making power would be devolved to the Scottish Executive and Parliament, and independence. In Wales, Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister, retired on 8 December and was replaced by Carwyn Jones.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Northern Ireland, terrorist activity escalated when, on 7 March, two British soldiers, about to be deployed to Afghanistan, were shot dead while collecting a delivery of food to the Massereene Barracks in County Antrim. The ‘Real IRA’ claimed responsibility for the attack. On 10 March, a police constable was shot dead while on patrol in County Armagh. Responsibility for this death was claimed by the ‘Continuity IRA’. The officer was the first member of the recently created Police Service of Northern Ireland to be killed. On the transfer of policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland, a bill establishing a Department of Justice and a procedure for appointing a minister to lead the department passed all its stages in the Northern Ireland Assembly by the end of November. The hope was that policing and justice powers would be devolved early in 2010. By mid‐December there were reports that the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association was preparing to decommission its weapons. Just before the end of 2009, Iris Robinson, wife of First Minister Peter Robinson, announced she was standing down as an MP and Member of the Legislative Assembly on health grounds. However, this was to be followed by allegations of an extramarital affair and, ultimately, to Peter Robinson stepping down as First Minister for a limited period in January 2010.</p>
         
         <p>British combat operations in Iraq officially came to an end on 30 April. Military action in Afghanistan continued during the year with an increase in the number of British troops such that there were around 9,000 deployed during the Afghan elections in August.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Election results</h2>
         
         <p>Local and European elections were held on 4 June with Labour suffering badly in both. At the local level, various English county councils and unitary authorities were elected. The BBC's calculations gave the Conservatives 38 per cent of the notional national vote. The Liberal Democrats came second on 28 per cent and Labour were third with their lowest score ever in these projections at 23 per cent. Labour lost the four remaining English county councils they controlled and suffered a net loss of 291 councillors. Results for the Liberal Democrats were net losses of one council and two councillors. There were net gains of seven councils for the Conservatives, including Derbyshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Staffordshire – all of which had long been run by Labour. The Conservatives made a net gain of 244 seats. Mayoral elections took place in Doncaster, Hartlepool and North Tyneside. The most notable result was a narrow victory for the English Democrats (a party favouring an English Parliament and withdrawal from the EU) in Doncaster over an independent candidate.</p>
         
         <p>At the European Parliament (EP) elections, the Conservatives came first with a rise of one point compared to their 2004 result – rather less than they might have hoped for prior to the expenses scandal. Labour was pushed into third place by UKIP and suffered the lowest score for a governing party in the United Kingdom since EP elections began. In Wales, Labour failed to top the poll for the first time in an election since 1918. Among other records broken, Labour's result represented the largest gap between a governing party's EP election score and its result in the preceding general election. The vote share taken by the two main parties, which had been comparatively low in 2004, therefore dropped even further, highlighting the differences in the party systems operating at Westminster and European elections. Undoubtedly the expenses scandal contributed to a situation in which ‘other parties’ did so well. The Liberal Democrats scored lower than in 2004, with 13.7 per cent of the vote – again performing less well in EP than in local elections.</p>
         
         <p>UKIP managed to slightly improve on their 2004 result and saw its vote go up in regions where Labour traditionally does well, such as the North East, North West and Wales, where they won one of the four seats available. The Greens also did better than in 2004, but due to disproportionality in the electoral system and the reduction in the number of United Kingdom seats from 78 to 72, did not see an increase in the number of their MEPs. The big news on election night was that the far‐right British National Party (BNP), whose increase in vote share was half that of the Greens, won two seats: one in the North West and another in Yorkshire and the Humber. Their level of support was higher in some other regions that send fewer members to the EP compared to the North West. Labour, it appears, lost out the most in places where BNP support went up.</p>
         
         <p>The Scottish National Party saw a rise of just over nine points compared with 2004 and topped the poll in Scotland for the first time in an EP election. This came after two years of their minority government at Holyrood. In Wales, there was also a rise in support for Plaid Cymru, although this was on a much smaller scale. Although there was no change in the parties winning the three Northern Ireland seats, there were some notable differences behind this. First, although their share of the first preference votes actually fell slightly from 2004, Sinn Féin won the most of these votes for the first time ever in an EP election. This was largely because of a second difference from the contest in 2004: the presence of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) – a breakaway group from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) led by former DUP MEP Jim Allister. While it failed to win a seat, the TUV appeared to have cut heavily into the DUP's support such that it declined by nearly 14 points. Under their continued alliance with the Conservative Party, the Ulster Unionists fought the election as Ulster Conservatives and Unionists – New Force.</p>
         
         <p>Turnout dropped about four points from the 2004 level – the highest ever seen in an EP election in the United Kingdom. In contrast to 2004, there were no all‐postal ballot regions for the 2009 election, so this is likely to go some way to explaining the decline, along with the impact of the expenses scandal. The latter formed the basis of much discussion in the campaign, along with the economy. The major parties referred little to the EU, with the Conservatives dedicating the whole of one of their party election broadcasts to expenses and Labour concentrating mainly on the economy in theirs. Where European integration did feature, discussion was mainly about either the Lisbon Treaty, on which the Conservatives were promising a referendum, or the question of United Kingdom membership of the EU, which was raised particularly by UKIP.</p>

         <p>There were two by‐elections for the House of Commons in 2009. The Conservatives gained Norwich North after the incumbent Labour MP, Dr Ian Gibson, resigned following Labour's decision to prevent him standing for the party at the next general election on the basis of his involvement in the expenses scandal. Labour won Glasgow North East, the seat vacated by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, who resigned from his position on 21 June. He was replaced as Speaker by Conservative MP John Bercow on 22 June. (Changes to the composition of the House of Lords are summarised in <a href="#t3" class="scrollableLink">Table 3</a>.)
