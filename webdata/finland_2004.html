         <p>Five cabinet seats changed hands during the year. In June, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) held a party congress. One of the main issues on the agenda was to choose a new party leader. Paavo Lipponen had been chairman of the party since 1993, prime minister between 1995 and 2003, and chairman of parliament since 2003. He was replaced by Eero Heinäluoma, the party secretary. The competition for the post received a lot of media attention as Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja and Minister of Education Tuula Haatainen ran against Heinäluoma. After the selection, a new debate started in the party over whether the new party leader could run the party efficiently without having a seat in cabinet. Of the SDP ministerial appointments, the Minister of Finance, who also served as the Deputy Prime Minister, was considered to be the most important. This was not an easy transition as at least one of the SDP ministers had to resign, and in a chain reaction others had to change their ministerial appointments. Eero Heinäluoma replaced Antti Kalliomäki, who took over the Ministry of Education. The former Minster of Education, Tuula Haatainen, was offered the post of Minister of Social Affairs and Health to replace Sinikka Mönkäre, who resigned. The former Minister of Transport and Communication, Leena Luhtanen, became the new Minister of Justice, replacing Johannes Koskinen who resigned. For the first time, a person without a university degree in law was selected to be Minister of Justice, which the new constitution of 2000 made possible. Susanna Huovinen took over the cabinet seat for Transport and Communication replacing Leena Luhtanen. In the end, two ministers resigned from the cabinet according to the principle that those who had served the longest as ministers should give place to new ones. The Social Democratic Party did not give much information about how all the changes in cabinet seats came to be agreed upon. Externally the process was given the appearance of consensus, although speculation about bargaining and pressure leaked out. In any case, the decison was taken over one night by the party executive and the parliamentary party.</p>
         
         <p>The year 2005 was dominated by strikes and lockouts, and during the autumn the campaign for the coming presidential election in January started. The most problematic labour problem was the conflict in the paper and pulp industry. Already in the autumn of 2004 the employers’ association had announced that they would not follow the general labour market agreement. Their intention was to reduce the benefits the paper union previously had negotiated. The paper union resisted all attempts from the employers’ association and local unions supported workers in refusing to work overtime. The paper union threatened with a strike supported by the union in Sweden, and the employers’ association took action and locked out workers from the paper mills. The lockout started on 18 May and lasted for six weeks. According to estimates, the lockout decreased national economic growth by one percentage point, but growth in Finland still was slightly above the European Union average. When the Border Guards’ Union threatened to strike in June, a debate about restricting the legal right to strike started. Debates of this kind are not new, but this time the cabinet gave parliament a proposal to prohibit strikes during the world championship in athletics in August. However, as the union withdrew its threat to strike, the proposal never came into force. The world championship could be undertaken without border control problems, but instead many of the events were disturbed by heavy rains.</p>
         
         <p>The presidential campaign started during the autumn, and the election in two rounds took place in January 2006. Altogether eight candidates were nominated, of whom the president, Tarja Halonen (Social Democrat and female) was a favourite. Her main opponent was the Conservative Sauli Niinistö, the former Minister of Finance and now working at the European Central Bank. In addition, the Centre Party leader and Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was nominated. The polls showed that Tarja Halonen was the most popular with much more than 50 per cent of the support. According to the rules, the president will be elected in the first round if she or he receives more than 50 per cent of the valid votes. If not, a new election will follow in a second round between the two most popular candidates. As the campaign went on, Tarja Halonen's popularity sank and the popularity of Sauli Niinistö and Matti Vanhanen increased. When the year came to an end, it was far from clear that Halonen could win the election in the first round and, as a result, the campaign got even more attention in the media.</p>
