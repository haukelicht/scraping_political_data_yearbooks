         <p>The year 2004 was one of minor elections. Although local, European and presidential elections (in order of political importance) were due to take place, in the end, the presidential election did not occur as the left could not agree upon a candidate to run against the conservative Catholic and traditional nationalist incumbent, Mary McAleese. The Labour Party failed to nominate a candidate, though a senior party member expressed a desire to stand. The Labour leader, Pat Rabbitte, eulogised about a self‐declared candidate from the Green Party, though Éamon Ryan's colleagues in the Green Party chose not to nominate a candidate. Both parties said financial considerations lay behind their respective decisions, but state funding was available, as would have been broad access to the free media. In the end, McAleese was returned unopposed on 1 October.</p>
         
         <p>The local elections took place on 11 June, the same day as the elections to the European Parliament. ‘Local government’ in Ireland is a misnomer. Councils have little power, and what power is exercised is effectively in the hands of public officials rather than the elected representatives. However, given the importance of local issues and constituency organisation in national elections, these were seen as important, if not for the results <i>per se</i>, then for the base they give parties to face general elections. The results were a disappointment for <i>Fianna Fáil</i>, which dropped 80 seats to 302. <i>Fine Gael</i> and Labour picked up 16 and 18 seats, respectively. The major winner was <i>Sinn Féin</i>, which won 33 more seats to bring its number of councillors to 54, which means that it is now represented on 21 of the 34 councils throughout Ireland. This worried the established parties, especially <i>Fianna Fáil</i>, as it provides <i>Sinn Féin</i> with a strong base with which to fight the next general election.

         <section class="article-section__sub-content" id="ss2"><h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2" id="ss2-title"> Elections to the European Parliament</h3>
            
            <p>The elections to the European Parliament (EP) took place with a reduction in seats (from 15 to 13) caused by European Union (EU) enlargement, making these elections more competitive. European elections in Ireland are a mixture of plebiscite on the incumbent government's performance and a series of personality contests. They also tend to draw out disagreements within the bigger parties as to how to divide constituencies between candidates. Despite extensive manifestoes, European issues are of negligible importance in the campaign.</p>
            
            <p>The election was disappointing for <i>Fianna Fáil</i>, which returned just four MEPs, losing an MEP in each of the constituencies with fewer representatives. It was especially disappointing for two former <i>Fianna Fáil</i> cabinet ministers who lost out to party colleagues. <i>Fine Gael</i> and <i>Sinn Féin</i> were happiest with the results, with the former becoming the largest Irish party in the EP. This provided a much‐needed morale boost for a party that was devastated in the 2002 general election. However, their success may have come at a price. Already short of well‐known names and faces, its success removes some of <i>Fine Gael</i>'s better known TDs (MPs) from national politics. <i>Sinn Féin</i> gained a seat in Dublin, though possibly by selecting a candidate unlike its national representatives (many of whom are middle‐aged men who have served a prison sentence). Mary‐Lou McDonald, who is young, middle‐class, articulate and attractive, is joined by another <i>Sinn Féin</i> MEP who was elected in Northern Ireland. The Green Party was disappointed to lose both of its seats. It performed remarkably well in EP elections, but was unable to sustain its support.
            </p>
            
            <p>These elections were expected to be the first held nationally using electronic voting. Although €60 million had been spent on voting machines, the vulnerability of this method to fraud and the lack of a back‐up paper trail forced the government to appoint a commission to evaluate the new system. It could not guarantee the system's reliability, so the elections were held using traditional ballot papers.</p>
            
         </section></section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>In September, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, reshuffled his cabinet. Ahern indicated his desire to do so over a year earlier, but it was understood that the reshuffle would take place following Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council. Members of <i>Fianna Fáil</i>'s parliamentary party also indicated a desire to change the tone of the government to the centre‐left. Many accused the government of following the junior coalition party's liberal‐market agenda. Ahern dismissed two older cabinet ministers (one had indicated his willingness to retire), and the free‐market Minister for Finance was appointed to the EU Commission. These moves enabled a general reshuffle in which only three ministers retained their portfolios.
         </p>
         
         <p>Ahern is notoriously conservative in changes to his personnel. The most significant moves were the appointment of Brian Cowen as Minister for Finance. This move to the most senior department increased his profile and the likelihood that he will succeed Ahern as leader of <i>Fianna Fáil</i>. His main rival, Micheál Martin, also broadened his portfolio experience in moving from Health to Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Tánaiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats, Mary Harney, chose to move to Health. She signalled a desire to overhaul the Irish health service, whose budget had vastly increased over the course of the government, but without visible improvement in services. This is a risky decision, as she takes over a department a previous minister described as ‘Angola’. Dermot Ahern (no relation to the Taoiseach) took over at Foreign Affairs. The reshuffle was not obviously a means to reward or punish ministers for good or poor performances. The most obvious demotion was that of Séamus Brennan, who went from Transport to Social Welfare. He had been a reforming minister. Brennan was replaced by Martin Cullen, who handled the introduction of electronic voting with petulance. Nor could one say that the reshuffle constituted a change in the ideological direction of the government. The subsequent budget put extra money into welfare and support for low earners, but this was not controversial within the government. Instead, the reshuffle seemed designed to reinvigorate the government following poor election results.

         <p>On same day as the European and local elections, the government held a referendum seeking to change the law governing citizenship. The Irish Constitution states that anyone born in Ireland (North or South) is automatically entitled to Irish citizenship. The government proposed changing the Constitution to grant automatic citizenship only to those people born of at least one Irish parent. Legislation to follow would provide for allowing others born in Ireland to gain citizenship only if one parent lived in Ireland legally for three of the previous four years. The Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, argued that the change was needed because an increasing number of pregnant women were presenting themselves to Irish maternity hospitals at full term. The suspicion was that non‐EU citizens were travelling to Ireland to take advantage of its liberal citizenship rules. The evidence for this was patchy and anecdotal at best, which prompted Labour, the Greens and <i>Sinn Féin</i> to oppose the proposal. These parties accused the government of pandering to racists while arguing that the change was necessary to prevent uncontrolled immigration that might lead to racism. <i>Fine Gael</i> joined the government parties in supporting the proposal, although it did question the timing of the referendum and the manner in which it was presented. Very little time was allowed for either a debate in the <i>Dáil</i> (parliament) or nationally.
         </p>
         
         <p>The result of the referendum was resoundingly in favour of the amendment, indicating perhaps that Irish people are increasingly concerned with immigration. Approximately 55,000 people from the new European Union accession countries immigrated to Ireland up to the end of the year. This was welcomed by the government, who argued that Ireland needed at least 30,000 immigrants a year if it is to maintain the current high levels of economic growth. Cases of racist abuse or assault increased in 2004 from a six‐monthly average of between 40 and 50, to 70 in the last six months of the year, but are still comparatively rare.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>Ireland's holding of the Presidency of the EU Commission in the first half of 2004 and yet another promise of a ‘final settlement’ to the ongoing ‘Peace Process’ in Northern Ireland in the second half of the year dominated the time and energies of the Irish government. The successful negotiation of the EU Constitution and enlargement gave the government and the Taoiseach a significant public relations boost, but these were not enough to prevent the significant drop in support for government parties in the local and European elections.</p>
         
         <p>The major domestic policy issue at the beginning of the year was the ban on smoking in all enclosed public places, including pubs. Although the Licensed Vintners’ Association predicted that the ban would be impossible to enforce, the ban came into effect in March and by the end of the year had widespread public support. There were few cases reported of the law not being enforced, nor did the predicted job losses result.</p>
         
         <p>A major controversy followed the revelation that elderly patients at Ireland's state‐run nursing homes were having their pensions illegally deducted to cover the costs of their care. The government introduced emergency legislation in an attempt to make the charges legal on a retrospective basis, and offered <i>ex gratia</i> payments of €2,000 to those who had monies deducted. At the end of the year, the President, having consulted the Council of State, referred this Bill to the Supreme Court for a test of its constitutionality.
         </p>
         
         <p>In December, there was genuine hope that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) would be willing to decommission its arms, and that this could lead to the reinstatement of the Northern Ireland Assembly and an Executive there. The settlement collapsed, rather bizarrely, because of the demands of Ian Paisley and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to see photographic evidence of decommissioning and <i>Sinn Féin</i>'s demand for the release of the killers of Jerry McCabe, a policeman murdered trying to prevent the robbery of a post office by the IRA. Dr Paisley made a speech in which he required a public humiliation of the IRA: in a reference to the Bible he demanded ‘sackcloth and ashes’. Finally, a £22 million (€31.5 million) bank robbery in Belfast, which was widely attributed to the IRA, made the possibility of a settlement ever more remote.
