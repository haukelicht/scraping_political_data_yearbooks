         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12033-sec-1001-title"> Composition of the cabinet (Federal Council)</h2>
         
         <p>The composition of the Swiss cabinet (Federal Council) remained unchanged in 2012, as the Swiss parliament had (re‐)elected the entire Federal Council on 14 December 2011. On the same day, the united Federal Assembly elected Federal Councillor Eveline Widmer‐Schlumpf (BDP/PBD, Conservative Democratic Party) as Federal President for 2012. She received 174 of 206 valid votes. On 5 December 2012, the united Federal Assembly selected Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer (SVP/UDC, Swiss People's Party) as Federal President for 2013. He received 148 of 202 valid votes.</p>
         
         <p>Although its composition remained unchanged in 2012, both in party political terms and in personnel, the Federal Council remains in a phase of uncertainty that began in 2003. The Swiss collegial form of government is based on bringing the largest parties together in the executive, and the collective electoral support of the four major parties integrated in this manner usually reaches 80 per cent or more. In addition, within this system of <i>concordance</i>, the four major parties consensually agree on how to distribute the seven Federal Council seats among themselves by party. The ‘magic formula’ for doing so, based on the electoral strength of each party, did not change from 1959 to 2003. Since 2003, however, there has been disagreement over how to appropriately distribute the seven Federal Council seats among the parties, in part because the electoral strength of some parties was no longer accurately reflected in the number of seats a given party received (or failed to receive). This constellation, which I call ‘<i>discordance</i>’, persisted in 2012. However, conflicts over the composition of the Federal Council were muted this year as neither individual Federal Councillors needed to be replaced nor was the entire Federal Council up for re‐election.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12033-sec-0002-title"> Changes in parliament</h2>
         
         <p>There were changes, owing to resignations, in two seats held by the Swiss People's Party. National Councillor Bruno Zuppiger (SVP/UDC, Zurich) quit his parliamentary seat on 10 September 2012, having previously withdrawn his candidacy for a seat on the Federal Council in December 2011 over his alleged misuse of inheritance funds. He was replaced by Gregor A. Rutz (SVP/UDC). Thurgau representative Peter Spuhler (SVP/UDC) resigned his seat at the end of the year, citing his heavy workload as an entrepreneur. This again sparked a debate about the viability of the Swiss non‐professional, militia system of political representation. Spuhler was replaced on 4 March 2013 by Verena Herzog (SVP/UDC).</p>
         
         <p>Two changes due to deaths took place in the FDP/PLR (Liberal Democratic) parliamentary party. Lucerne National Councillor Otto Ineichen (FDP/PLR), who died on 6 June 2012, was replaced by Peter Schilliger (FDP/PLR) on 10 September 2012. Owing to the death of Basel‐City National Councillor Peter Malama (FDP/PLR) on 22 September 2012, Daniel Stolz succeeded him on 26 November 2012.</p>
         
         <p>Changes to SPS/PSS (Social Democratic) parliamentary party representation also took place in both houses of parliament. Alain Berset (SPS/PSS), who had represented the canton of Fribourg in the Council of States (upper house) since 2003, was elected Federal Councillor on 14 December 2011. In a by‐election, National Councillor Christian Levrat (SPS/PSS), President of the Social Democratic Party, was elected to succeed him, and moved from the lower to the upper house on 29 May 2012. Levrat's lower house seat was filled that same day by new National Councillor Ursula Schneider‐Schüttel (SPS/PSS).</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12033-sec-0003-title"> Results of national referendums and initiatives</h2>
         
         <p>A total of 12 national referendums were held in 2012, with Swiss voters asked to go to the polls four times in all (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12033-tbl-0002">2</a>). Five proposals were decided on 11 March 2012, three referendums and two federal decrees or acts. The voting participation rate for the differing proposals averaged about 45 per cent. The goal of the popular initiative ‘an end to limitless construction of second homes!’ was to curb the building of second apartments or homes in tourist regions, with an eye to limiting sprawl and protecting nature, especially in the mountain regions. To this end, according to its initiators, the most prominent of whom is environmentalist Franz Weber, second homes in Swiss communities were to be limited to 20 per cent of all housing in a community. Both parliament and Federal Council recommended rejecting this initiative. They argued that the recently revised regional planning law, which had gone into force on 1 July 2011, already appropriately addressed the issues raised by the initiative. Supporters of the initiative, however, felt the revised regional planning law lacked effective implementation measures and changing the federal constitution, as the initiative called for, remained necessary. Swiss voters approved the initiative with a very narrow 50.6 per cent majority, with 12 full and three half‐cantons voting for, and eight full and three half‐cantons voting against. Lowland cantons outvoted the tourist‐oriented mountain cantons. The latter cantons, most affected by the limitation, have complained about the constraints this initiative places on economic development.

         <p>The first of three housing proposals in 2012 also came to a vote on 11 March 2012. This popular initiative ‘for tax‐favoured building savings to acquire self‐used homes and to finance energy savings and environmental measures in construction’ was also known as the ‘building savings initiative’. Its purpose was to introduce tax incentives to encourage energy efficient and environment‐friendly construction and to make it easier to build equity in order to purchase one's own home or apartment. The initiative proposed that cantons should have the power to decide over the use of these instruments, and that the tax incentives would only apply cantonal and community taxes (which together form the majority of Swiss tax revenues), but not national taxes. The Federal Council recommended rejection, but the two houses of parliament could not agree on a recommendation. Swiss voters rejected the initiative by a relatively clear 55.8 per cent, as did 16 full and five half‐cantons. Subsequent analyses (Greuter et al. <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>) indicated that the tax incentives would have been to the benefit of a relatively small segment of Swiss society, and this fact played a significant role in the initiative's defeat.
         </p>
         
         <p>The third proposal was the popular initiative ‘six weeks' vacation for all’. It proposed increasing the length of paid vacation from four to six weeks – a suggestion which certainly sounded as though it ought to be popular. The initiative had been suggested by Travail Suisse, a peak union association, with an eye to giving workers a larger share in Switzerland's increased economic productivity. The thought was also to try to harmonise minimum labour demands across the country. Both Federal Council and parliament recommended rejection, noting existing and proven regulations. The result – rejection by 66.5 per cent of the voters and all of the cantons – drew considerable international attention. Debates during the initiative campaign ran along classic left–right lines, with the left (SPS/PSS, GPS/PES, Swiss Green Party, unions) in support and the centre‐right (CVP/PDC, FDP/PLR, SVP/UDC, employer associations) in opposition. The argument that extending the length of vacation time would place too heavy a burden on the Swiss economy played a significant role for voters who rejected this proposal (Greuter et al. <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). It was especially surprising to observers outside the country that the Swiss placed the good of their economy ahead of their own vacation entitlements.
         </p>
         
         <p>The federal decree ‘on regulating gambling for public benefit and charitable purposes’ was the fourth proposal to be decided on 11 March 2012. This was a counter‐proposal to a popular initiative ‘for gambling profits in the service of the common good’ that had been withdrawn. Because the federal decree involved amending the constitution, voters and cantons had to approve or reject the changes. The federal decree regulates the national and cantonal competencies with respect to gambling, including implementation of this regulation, plus it contains provisions to counter gaming's negative impacts. A broad consensus among social and political actors had been reached in the course of working out this proposal so many objections had already been addressed and answered. As a result, 87.1 per cent of the voters and all the cantons approved this decree.</p>
         
         <p>The fifth and final proposal was a referendum against the federal act governing the prices of books. In earlier years there had been a fixed book price agreement, though this practice was abandoned in the 1990s in the French‐speaking part of the country and a decade later in the German‐speaking areas. The federal act proposed reintroducing an abandoned practice and once again fixing the price of books. Both Federal Council and parliament recommended approval, though not without considerable debate in parliament as well as votes taken there that revealed substantial opposition. Opponents of reintroduction argued that fixed price rules inappropriately limited free trade. In the end, 56.1 per cent of the voters rejected the law, and thus the reintroduction of fixed book prices; the liberal market arguments made by the referendum committee carried the day. Only a minority of voters agreed that protecting the book trade and having uniform pricing were sufficient grounds to intervene in the free market. Along with the classic left–right division, the voting also revealed clear divergence between the language regions: while French‐speaking cantons would have approved of reintroducing fixed book prices, German‐speaking Switzerland quite clearly rejected it.</p>
         
         <p>In the second election on 17 June 2012, two popular initiatives and a referendum were on the ballot. Voting participation was just over 38.5 per cent. All three proposals were decisively defeated. The popular initiative ‘one's own four walls thanks to building savings’ called for tax‐favoured treatment of building savings funds to be used to acquire one's first, and self‐used, home. Had the initiative been accepted, the national government and the cantons would have been obligated to introduce corresponding tax incentives. This proposal thus addressed similar issues as the building savings initiative rejected in March, though it was more forceful in nature. It is thus not surprising that this proposal, too, was rejected, and by a far more decisive 68.9 per cent, as well as in every canton. The motivations for rejection were quite similar to those cited for the March initiative (Milic &amp; Vatter <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0019" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0019R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 6).
         </p>
         
         <p>The popular initiative ‘to strengthen popular control over foreign policy (international treaties before the people!)’ was launched by the Campaign for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland (AUNS), a conservative political group close to the Swiss People's Party in favour of national autonomy. The suggestion was to increase the scope of mandatory popular referendums in the case of international treaties. Federal Council and parliament recommended rejecting the initiative since existing practices already gave the electorate an appropriate degree of co‐determination of such treaties, and the existing framework already allowed optional referendums on international treaties as needed or demanded. The result of the plebiscite was surprisingly clear, with 75.3 per cent of the voters, along with all the cantons, decisively defeating the proposed initiative. Of the major parties, only the Swiss People's Party supported it. Subsequent analyses (Milic &amp; Vatter <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0019" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0019R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 6) indicated the proposal was unsuccessful at convincing voters who did not otherwise support the Swiss People's Party. To many voters the proposal went too far, and they feared it would simply generate a large number of ‘unnecessary’ plebiscites.
         </p>
         
         <p>The third proposal on 17 June 2012 was a referendum to revise the federal law on health insurance, also known as the ‘managed care proposal’. The revision had three key elements: first, integrated health care was to be strengthened (through managed care); second, the balance between various health insurance organisations needed to be calibrated to curb the tendency of insurers to chase after only ‘good risk’ subscribers; and third, co‐payments for pregnancy care and childbirth services care were to be abolished. While the latter two elements were uncontroversial, that was not true of the managed care element. The Federal Council and the parliament supported the referendum, though after parliamentary debates, party support for what would mean a substantial alteration to the health care system began crumbling. In the end, the proposal was resoundingly, and surprisingly strongly, rejected by 76.1 per cent of the voters. In their decision, reservations about managed care, particularly focused on what was perceived as a challenge to being able to freely choose one's doctor, played an important role in voters' minds (Milic &amp; Vatter <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0019" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0019R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 5).
         </p>
         
         <p>Two proposals and one federal decree were on the ballot on 23 September 2012. Slightly more than 42 per cent of the eligible electorate took part in these votes. The first proposal concerned a federal decree calling for a new article in the constitution to promote music education among children and youths. Parliament had crafted this constitutional article as a counter‐proposal to a popular initiative that was withdrawn as a result. Those in favour emphasised the importance of music both for the individual and for society. Those in opposition felt a proposal of this kind did not deserve constitutional status and that existing regulations had proven themselves and needed no changes (Cappelletti et al. <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0014R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 5). Debate was relatively muted, with proponents clearly in the majority. This was also evident in the result, as the decree was approved by 72.7 per cent of the voters and all the cantons.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second proposal was the third in the set of housing‐related initiatives placed before the voters in 2012. In this case, the popular initiative ‘secure housing in old age’ called for greater flexibility in the tax treatment of retiree housing. More specifically, seniors were to be given an opportunity to not, under certain circumstances, have the imputed rental value of their property be taxed. Both Federal Council and parliament recommended that the proposal, which had come from the Swiss Homeowners' Association, be rejected. The voters agreed, though narrowly, with 52.6 per cent and 11 full as well as five half‐cantons voting against. For proponents, at issue was the elimination of the imputed rental value and the reduction of mortgage indebtedness; for opponents, the most troubling aspect was the inequality of treatment the initiative suggested, both between different generations and between homeowners and renters (Cappelletti et al. <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0014R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>: 6).
         </p>
         
         <p>The third proposal on 23 September 2012 was a popular initiative to provide ‘protection from passive smoking’. It had been submitted by the Pulmonary League as well as other health organisations. The initiative called for strengthening protection against passive smoking, in particular by extending smoking bans to cover interior and indoor rooms. The initiative would have created uniform national regulations; considerable variation in smoking regulations currently exists between the cantons. Despite a quite intense campaign on the part of its proponents, the initiative was quite decisively rejected by 65.1 per cent of the voters and by all of the cantons except for Geneva. Those who voted against found the proposal unnecessary and existing cantonally differentiated regulations appropriate.</p>
         
         <p>Swiss voters were called to the polls a fourth and final time in 2012 on 25 November. Against expectation, only a single proposal was up for a vote: a referendum against changing the Animal Diseases Act. It had been expected that additional referendums (on the withholding tax agreements with Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria) would also be on the ballot, but surprisingly, not enough valid signatures were gathered to place them on the ballot. Due to the minor mobilisation over just one referendum item, voting participation reached a record low of only 27.6 per cent. The proposal called for a series of changes to the Animal Diseases Act to address new challenges and to strengthen preventative measures, particularly to inhibit the outbreak of animal epidemics and to strengthen animal health. It was surprising this referendum had even come about as the changes being proposed had been approved in both houses of parliament with only a single vote in opposition (Milic &amp; Widmer <span><a href="#epdy12033-bib-0020" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12033-bib-0020R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2013</a></span>: 8). However, a group composed of the proponents of a more ecologically oriented agriculture, opponents of vaccination and naturopaths were able to successfully gather the required number of signatures in time. The campaign was lacklustre and the proposal received little public attention. The voters quite clearly favoured revising the Animal Diseases Act, and 68.3 per cent voted to introduce the changes.
