<section class="article-section article-section__full"><section class="article-section__content" id="s1-1"><p>The international events of 2003 and especially the war in Iraq played an important role in Italian political life. As in many other countries, public opinion expressed hostility to the breakout of an American‐led military intervention in Iraq. Massive mobilizations, which included the exhibition of rainbow flags for peace in many windows and balconies all over Italy (according to some surveys, more than one out four citizens declared that they had bought and/or displayed such flags), were organized by a coalition of traditional leftist parties, anti‐globalization movements and Catholic associations. The variegated front of the anti‐war coalition produced some of the largest demonstrations in recent times with the exception of the trade union rally in Rome in March 2002 (see the entry on Italy in the <i>Political Data Yearbook 2002</i>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The centre‐right Government, on the other side, oscillated from overt support of the Bush Administration with the signing of a letter of endorsement by eight European heads of government and state, to the refusal to back the intervention with military troops. This self‐restraint was imposed by the strong, direct statements against the war made by the Pope, rather than by the opposition displayed by public opinion. However, once the Anglo‐American troops entered Baghdad, the Government decided to send a mission of ‘humanitarian assistance’ to the Iraqi people supported by some military troops for the protection of the civilians involved in the mission. In reality, the military component outnumbered by many times the civilians, implicitly modifying the parliamentary mandate from the very beginning. The opposition in Parliament was unanimously against the war, but displayed different attitudes. While the bulk of the centre‐left – the Democratici di Sinistra (DS) and the Margherita (the Daisy) – had abstained in the vote for the ‘humanitarian mission’, a more radical stand (quite critical towards the major parties of the centre‐left as well) was put forward by the hard‐line communists of Rifondazione Comunista and the Greens, and by the peace movement outside Parliament. The opposition to the Italian involvement in Iraq by the more moderate wing of the centre‐left increased in intensity with the passing of time and the (inevitable) militarization of the Italian mission.</p>
         
         <p>The attack against the Italian headquarter in Nassiryia in November, which produced 19 deaths among the Italian contingent – the highest level of causalities suffered by the Italian Army abroad since the Second World War – raised enormous emotion, but did not alter the attitudes either of the Government or the opposition: the Government decided to maintain the Italian presence and the centre‐left, while stressing its opposition in principle, did not demand an immediate withdrawal. In a way, that event created a moment of non‐emphatic national unity, quite rare in Italian history, even if it did not alter the political divide.</p>
         
         <p>Another sensitive issue on the international agenda concerned the Government's attitude towards the European Union (EU), especially because Italy was in charge of the EU presidency in the second half of the year. The traditionally strong pro‐Europe Italian stance had been reversed since the first steps of Berlusconi's Government, shifting the balance of attention in favour of Washington rather than Brussels. The signing of the ‘letter of the Eight’ supporting the United States in the Iraq War against the Franco‐German position broke the conventional Italian support of the EU‐centred initiatives (and implicitly France's initiatives).</p>
         
         <p>The Italian half year of EU presidency had one declared main aim: to conclude the process leading to an EU constitutional treaty. Actually the Italian diplomatic corps and the Foreign Ministry were not quite ready for such a delicate task and the preparatory meetings were inadequate in overcoming the difficulties. In the European Council held in December, the Italian Government displayed an embarrassing level of amateurism and lack of preparation. Berlusconi's desire to gain the international aura of the ‘grand mediator’ who accomplished the European Constitution ran counter to his lack of commitment and skills. Moreover, such an ambitious aim had been endangered since the beginning of the mandate when, in the traditional address to the European Parliament by the new EU president, Berlusconi responded to the criticism from the German socialist leader Martin Schultz with the epithet of ‘<i>Kapò</i>’. This gaffe aroused widespread concern and for a while chilled the relationship with Germany; even more, a couple of days after, the under‐secretary of Tourism made further anti‐German statements inducing Chancellor Schroeder to cancel his holidays in Italy. If one adds the direct criticism of French President Jacques Chirac as far as his policy against military intervention in Iraq was concerned, the deviation from the traditional political path in the European arena appears even clearer.
         </p>
         
         <p>Foreign policy issues occupied a central space in the domestic political debate: both the centre‐right and the centre‐left coalitions were somewhat split in dealing with such issues, the latter more deeply than the former. As far as the centre‐right is concerned, all parties shared support for American policy towards Iraq, but they diverged on the EU. The Catholic minor partner of the coalition (the UDC) was much more europhile, in line with the Christian Democratic tradition, and even Alleanza Nazionale (AN), thanks to the party leader Gianfranco Fini's role of government representative in the European Convention, shifted toward a more pro‐Europe stance than before. On the other hand, Forza Italia and, above all, the Lega Nord, shared eurosceptic positions. The centre‐left displayed substantial unity <i>vis‐à‐vis</i> Europe (with some reservation by the hard‐liner Rifondazione Comunista), but they split over the Iraq War. The radical peace movement, supported by Rifondazione Comunista and the Greens, advocated a tougher attitude against the Government, even in the case of the ‘humanitarian mission’, and demanded immediate withdrawal after the Nassirya attack. This foreign policy cleavage created a permanent tension within the opposition front.
         </p>
         
         <p>In domestic politics, the main events concerned: the trials involving Berlusconi and his friends for bribery and corruption, which heightened the tension between Government and magistrates; the new television regulations directly involving the Prime Minister's personal interests as he still enjoys a near monopoly of the private television market; the dismantling of the revived Red Brigades after a dramatic shooting in a train; the coalition process within the centre‐left involving three components sponsored by the President of the EU Commission and former centre‐left Prime Minister Romano Prodi; the dramatic break with fascism put forward by AN leader Gianfranco Fini during his visit in Israel; the collapse of a major Italian company – the dairy firm Parmalat – because of serious false accounting; the electoral backlash suffered by the centre‐right in some salient administrative contests; the failure of the referendum to abolish labour regulations and other (minor) topics; the immunity law for the highest political officials; and the stigmatization by the centre‐right of the euro as the only cause of the national economic stagnation and inflation.</p>
         
         <p>The confrontation between the magistrates and the Government continued in 2003. There were many occasions to inflame the conflict. The most visible one was provided by the trials involving Berlusconi himself and some of his closest fellows. Two trials went before the courts. Both concerned the corruption of judges to get favourable judgements; in one case, the court declared Berlusconi's lawyer guilty, but could not sentence the Prime Minister because, in the meantime, a new law was passed to assure him (and other high state officials such as the President of the Republic, the president of the constitutional court and the presidents of the two parliamentary chambers) full immunity. The second trial is still pending. The hostility repeatedly manifested by the Prime Minister against the magistrates arrived at the point of him declaring that ‘only mentally disturbed people could pursue the judicial profession’. The magistrates responded announcing a ‘general strike’ that did not take place in the end thanks to mediation by the President of the Republic.</p>
         
         <p>Another relevant event within the centre‐right camp was provided by the ultimate statements on fascism by the leader of Alleanza Nazionale. During his long‐awaited visit to Israel, Fini defined fascism to be ‘an absolute devil’ and acknowledged the responsibility of the Italian regime in the Holocaust. This declaration represented the final break with the ambiguities on the evaluation of fascism that had long haunted the party. The furore raised in the most nostalgic sectors of the party was actually limited to a sort of transient emotional displacement and only Alessandra Mussolini, the Duce's granddaughter, left the party.</p>
         
         <p>On the left side, the most relevant novelty was produced by the appeal by the President of the EU Commission, Romano Prodi, to gather and unite all the centre‐left parties, re‐launching the Olive Tree coalition. The reactions to this appeal were very positive and a process of aggregation was enforced by both of the major parties of the centre‐left – the DS and the Daisy – plus the minor socialist SDI. In few weeks, these three parties decided to present themselves with the same platform and the same symbol for the 2004 European elections. The other leftist parties maintained their autonomy because of their propensity for a stricter linkage with the peace and anti‐globalization movements rather than for a ‘reformist’ policy. Therefore, the cleavage between the radical and reformist tendency within the centre‐left kept its salience, even if the two components agreed in looking for a common ground and in cooperating at election time.</p>
         
         <p>The information question still provided occasions for conflict. Berlusconi's ownership of a media empire that covers almost the totality of the private television market, the major publishing company, newspapers and magazines, and one of the largest advertising companies continued to represent an anomaly for the working of the democratic system, given the uneven concentration of power in a single person. In the attempt to modify this setting, the Government passed a new law in December regulating the market including forthcoming new communication technologies. Actually the law was designed to ensure the continuation and even the expansion of Berlusconi's media empire, thus failing to solve the Prime Minister's pending conflict of interests. In the face of this law, President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi – who addressed his only message to the Chambers precisely on the question of the freedom of information as early as in 2002 – refused to sign the law and sent it back to the Chambers for further revisions. Given the exceptionality of this act (it occurs only a few times in a president's tenure) and the extremely salient question, the Government, and especially the Prime Minister, suffered a strong blow.</p>
         
         <p>Five referenda and two local rounds of elections were held. The referenda had no impact on political life because they failed to meet the minimum number of voters to validate their results (turnout of 25.7 per cent). This outcome was not due to the electorate's disengagement or alienation, but rather to the demobilization messages send by all the major parties that rated it as useless or counterproductive to call for massive participation. One of the referenda, in particular, that on the reform of Article 18 of the Workers Statute, was in fact quite embarrassing for the major party of the left and therefore the party preferred to discourage participation in order to keep the referendum from meeting the threshold of validity. On the other hand, the local election produced relevant effects notwithstanding the limited number of local councils involved. The most dramatic outcomes came from the provincial contest in Rome where the centre‐left candidate defeated the centre‐right incumbent, and from the Friuli‐Venezia Giulia region where the left‐wing candidate won, gaining more than 25 percentage points compared to the 2001 general election. As these votes occurred in right‐wing strongholds, they created some tensions within the Government coalition and AN claimed (unsuccessfully) a more relevant role in cabinet.<a href="#t1%20#t2%20#t3" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>Finally, two quite different, but in a way related, ‘social’ events are worth noting. On the one side was the low‐profile return in Italy of the Savoy royal family after the Constitution was amended (in 2002) to delete the ban to their presence on Italian soil. They ended their exile initiated in 1946 after the referendum, which introduced the republican regime. On the other side was the death of Gianni Agnelli, long‐time president of Fiat, the largest Italian firm, a personality who went beyond the economic sphere (he was also president of the industrialists’ association Confindustria in the mid‐late 1970s and life Senator since the early 1990s), and who fascinated the establishment and the public opinion with his witty and sharp judgements and his ‘royal’ allure. Gianni Agnelli's funeral had the atmosphere of a great state occasion. In a way, the Agnellis had occupied the role of a royal family in the national imagery.</p>
