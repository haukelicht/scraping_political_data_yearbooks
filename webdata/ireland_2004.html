         <p>Two bye‐elections took place during the year, both caused by the appointment of sitting TDs (MPs), one from Fianna Fáil, the other Fine Gael, to European Union (EU) posts. The government parties failed to win either seat. Vote transfers allowed Fine Gael to hold its seat, and a left‐wing independent won the other contest. This extended to thirty years the time since a government party has won a bye‐election.</p>

         <p>Following the Northern Bank robbery in December 2004 (see <span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">O'Malley &amp; Marsh 2005</a></span>), 2005 was a year in which a great deal of pressure was put on Sinn Féin and the IRA. Members of Sinn Féin were arrested in relation to money laundering, although charges in relation to the bank robbery were not made. The normally amicable relations between Sinn Féin and the Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Bertie Ahern, soured, as he publicly criticised the nationalist movement for its links to organised crime. The murder of a man in a pub in Belfast in a drunken brawl put further pressure on Sinn Féin as it emerged that the suspects were members of the IRA. Although many Sinn Féin members were at the bar, no one was willing to give evidence to the police. The murdered man's sisters began a brave and determined campaign which even led to their invitation to the White House. Following an ‘internal investigation’ the IRA suspended three of its members, and in a bizarre gesture offered to shoot these three people as punishment. By the end of the year, millions of euros worth of assets were seized on both sides of the border and on the British mainland in an attempt to close down the criminal operations of the IRA. These events did not have any obvious impact on the long‐term trend in Sinn Féin support, which remained upwards. However, this sustained pressure forced Sinn Féin/IRA to end its ‘armed campaign’ in July and the IRA went on to decommission its weapons (although there were still disputes about its verification). However, the IRA did not disband as some had hoped and these moves were not enough for unionists to allow the reopening of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

         <p>In domestic politics, the condition of the health service was an important issue during 2005. A number of deaths in unusual circumstances or when hospitals were unable to treat patients because of a shortage of resources put the government under pressure. By the end of the year, news programmes had almost daily announcements of the number of patients being treated on hospital trolleys rather than in beds. A number of massive cost overruns on health and other government projects also gave support for the opposition parties' ‘government waste’ agenda. A surprisingly successful television programme called <i>Rip‐off Republic</i> exposed, in an accessible way, some areas of government waste and the full extent of taxes in Ireland, making this issue even more intensely debated.
         </p>
         
         <p>The issue of immigration and workers' rights also emerged as a political issue. An opposition TD revealed how a number of Turks, working in Ireland for Gama Construction, a company with state road‐building contracts, had been paid far less than the minimum wage. Late in the year a dispute arose about the redundancy of workers for Irish Ferries. These were being laid off to hire cheaper labour, mainly from Eastern Europe. As Irish Ferries planned to reregister its ships in Cyprus or the Bahamas, it would not have been subject to Irish employment legislation. Unions refused to accept the voluntary redundancy proposals, but eventually negotiated a settlement which ensured that new workers would be subject to minimum wage and other legislation. This affair had an impact on social partnership as unions looked for commitments to workers' rights and security in the new partnership agreement being negotiated. These agreements, which have run from 1987, have been cited as a cause of the Irish economic boom. However employers argued against attempts to make the employment market more rigid and threatened not to sign up to any such agreement.</p>
         
         <p>Rifts emerged between the government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The latter, a small free market party, had hoped to liberalise two sectors of the economy – airports and bars – by introducing an independent second terminal in Dublin airport and allowing an extension of the number of bar licences to continental‐style café bars. In what might be seen as an indication of the changing balance of power within the coalition, Fianna Fáil got its way on both issues. While both parties wanted to make clear each one's separate agenda, neither party was willing to force a split in the government on these issues in advance of the election which must take place by summer 2007.</p>
         
         <p>Fine Gael and the Labour Party started negotiations on forming a government after the next election. Though it seems unlikely that they will have enough seats between them to form a majority coalition by themselves, that the Green Party indicated its unwillingness to coalesce with Fianna Fáil, and Fianna Fáil ruled out coalition with Sinn Féin, may increase their chances. The Labour leader, Pat Rabbitte, was criticised within his own party for making the commitment to Fine Gael. Such pre‐election pacts have not been seen as useful to Labour, and tying itself to Fine Gael may prevent it getting a better agreement with Fianna Fáil. Rabbitte indicated that he would resign as leader rather than be part of such a coalition.</p>
