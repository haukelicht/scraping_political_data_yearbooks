         <p>Minister for Housing, Urban Areas and Integration Ella Vogelaar resigned and was replaced by Eberhard van der Laan on 14 November. The party leadership felt that Vogelaar was not performing well enough and persuaded her to resign – a novelty in Dutch politics where ministers normally step down only when they lose support in parliament.</p>

         <p>Politically, 2008 was a quiet year in the Netherlands: no elections, no referendum, no coalition crisis, no party splits. That said, however, the integration of Muslim immigrants continued to haunt Dutch politics. On 27 March, the leader of the Freedom Party (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV), Geert Wilders, presented a short polemical documentary against Islam on the Internet entitled <i>Fitna</i>– ignoring warnings from the Prime Minister and other ministers who expressed concern about the consequences. Muslims in Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan and other countries protested. Dutch Muslims reacted calmly. Complaints were lodged against Wilders not only because of the movie, but because of statements he had made on other occasions. The public prosecutor decided in June 2008 not to prosecute Wilders, however. In the polls, the PVV did not benefit from the controversial movie, but lost a little support. Its rival, the more moderate but also nationalist populist movement Proud of the Netherlands (Trots op Nederland) may have wooed voters away from the PVV. By June it appeared able to win 24 seats (out of 150) in the Dutch parliament. However, conflicts between the leader of the movement, former Minister for Foreigners and Integration Rita Verdonk, and her associates contributed to a rapid decline in its popularity: by the end of the year, support for Proud of the Netherlands would only have won it five seats.

         <p>Another issue that was often discussed in 2008 concerned Dutch involvement in the war in Iraq. When they joined a coalition with the Labour Party and the Christian Union in 2007, the Christian Democrats had insisted that this would not be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry – as the Labour Party had suggested. In December 2008, the Senate discussed the question. Not only the Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid, PvdA) and the left‐wing opposition parties, but also the Liberal Party (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie, VVD), which had supported Dutch involvement in 2003, favoured an inquiry – together, these parties held a majority in the upper house. A decision would be taken in 2009.</p>
         
         <p>The banking crisis that erupted in the Netherlands, as elsewhere, in the autumn of 2008 did not have immediate political consequences. It might, though, have boosted the popularity of the Labour Party leader Wouter Bos, who as Minister of Finance ‘saved’ the Dutch banks ING and ABN AMRO by having the state buy their shares.</p>

         <p>In November, the lower house (Tweede Kamer) agreed to end experiments with the direct election of mayors. Since 2002 municipalities had had the option of organising a direct election – usually between two candidates selected by the municipal council. Often, however, turnout was quite low. In 2007 the Minister of Home Affairs, Guusje ter Horst (PvdA), had already decided to stop subsidising this type of election. She preferred the traditional appointment of mayors by the government after consulting the municipal council (see also <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Lucardie and Voerman, forthcoming</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In October the cabinet approved a new bill on party funding; the bill would be submitted to the parliament in 2009 or later. The cabinet also decided to reduce subsidies to political parties by almost 10 per cent over the next four years. Subsidies had been increasing steadily since 1999 to more than €15 million by 2006/2007.</p>
