         <p>Questions relating to the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern's personal finances had pervaded the 2007 election campaign and this controversy continued to dog Ahern in early 2008. The Mahon Tribunal (previously Flood Tribunal) had, for a number of years, investigated decisions by planning authorities and payments to politicians and officials. It had started to question Ahern on a number of unorthodox and unexplained payments to him while he was Minister for Finance in the early and mid‐1990s. Ahern had performed poorly in the Tribunal, and his evasive and often inconsistent answers and increasingly incredible evidence fomented suspicion that he was hiding something. In January he repeated attacks on the Tribunal and its terms of reference, which had been set by the government he led. In February it was revealed that his former partner had used money donated to Ahern's constituency party to buy a house. After this he indicated his intention to stay on as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil until 2012. This caused some concern among senior party colleagues who had assumed he would stand down after the European and local elections in 2009. In mid‐March his former constituency secretary recanted her previous evidence that she had not lodged sterling cash on Ahern's behalf. The continued pressure started to show, with his partners in government calling for him to clarify the matter and his cabinet colleagues beginning to lose patience. On 2 April Bertie Ahern announced his intention to step down as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil on 6 May.</p>
         
         <p>Brian Cowen had already been identified by Ahern as his natural successor and had been appointed Tánaiste (literally: heir apparent) in 2007. Cowen had held many cabinet posts since 1992 and was incumbent Minister for Finance. A less populist politician than Ahern, he was still very popular with the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, the eligible electorate for the leadership election. It quickly emerged that no one would challenge Cowen's succession, which took place by acclamation. The new Taoiseach made few changes to the personnel of the cabinet. Seamus Brennan, who was seriously ill and died soon after, indicated that he did not wish to be reappointed. His new appointments were Batt O'Keefe, a close friend, and Brendan Smith, who had sat at cabinet as Minister for Children. As part of a reshuffle, two other confidants, Mary Coughlin and Brian Lenihan, became Tánaiste/Minister for Enterprise and Employment and Minster for Finance, respectively. The reshuffle did not affect the three ministers from Fianna Fáil's coalition partners.</p>
         
         <p>The death of Seamus Brennan in July meant that the Government lost one seat in the Dáil. The by‐election to replace him had not taken place by the end of the year. Beverley Cooper‐Flynn, who was elected as an independent, rejoined Fianna Fáil on 3 April (she had loyally voted Fianna Fáil despite having been expelled from the party some years earlier). However, in October, a Fianna Fáil TD (MP) Joe Behan resigned from the party over the removal of the automatic right to free medical services to the over 70s (see below). Another independent who had voted with the government, Finian McGrath, withdrew his support for the same reason.</p>
         
         <p>Another government party, the Progressive Democrats, which had been reduced to two seats in the previous year's general election, elected a new leader in April. It had to change the party's rules to allow senators to take the leadership since neither of the party's two TDs wanted it. Senator Ciarán Cannon failed to make any impression, and in November the party's national executive voted to begin the process to wind up the party. This led to questions about the position of Mary Harney, the party's sole representative in government, but she remained in cabinet.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss2"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss2-title"> Lisbon Treaty referendum</h2>
         
         <p>On assuming office the new Taoiseach Brian Cowen set the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by the Irish people as his first priority. The Treaty was the response of the EU to the Constitutional Treaty's defeat in France and the Netherlands. Legally all changes to the Irish Constitution must be made by reference to the people, and a legal case in the 1980s established that European Union treaties had constitutional force and so were subject to referendum. The resignation of Ahern and appointment of Cowen meant that little political attention was given to the Lisbon Treaty and this, it transpired was crucial to the Treaty's defeat (see <span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Quinlan 2009</a></span> for a fuller discussion).
         </p>
         
         <p>Early opinion polls indicated a great deal of indifference or confusion. The defeat of the Nice Treaty in 2001 meant that no one could rely on the Irish people's strong support for the EU or the fact that most Irish political parties supported the Treaty to see it through the referendum. A number of business organisations and prominent individuals came together to form the Irish Alliance for Europe, a campaign group for the Treaty. The Green Party remained neutral because it had failed to get the measure passed by a sufficient majority at its delegate conference. Sinn Féin was the only party represented in the Dáil (lower house) to campaign against the Treaty. The campaign against the Treaty did throw up an eclectic mix of interests ranging from radical nationalists, small left‐wing groups, peace activists, the religious right to, most interestingly, a neo‐liberal think‐tank, Libertas. Constitutional law prevents the state from funding any partial messages, so a Referendum Commission was set up to provide impartial information on the subject. Its information, however, was so impartial as to be anodyne. The parties' campaigns were low key and used by individual politicians campaigning for European and local elections in 2009 to put their posters on lampposts. Little canvassing was done and the parties spent very little money.</p>
         
         <p>Pedestrian campaigning by the ‘yes’ side meant the ‘no’ side successfully set the agenda for the referendum campaign. While the ‘yes’ side's campaign was vague, depending on the high popularity of the EU, the ‘no’ campaign posed much clearer choices for potential voters. The campaign centred on issues such as a loss of sovereignty, the loss of an Irish Commissioner, moral issues – in particular the possibility that Lisbon might enable the legalisation of abortion in Ireland – and the direction of the ongoing World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade talks. On economic and national sovereignty, slogans such as ‘It’ll cost you – more tax, less power' issued clear threats to people's wealth. Libertas' Declan Ganley, a London‐born Irish multi‐millionaire with alleged links to neo‐conservatives in the United States, raised questions about the independence of Ireland's low‐tax regime if the Treaty were passed. Other issues of sovereignty included threats to Ireland's neutrality, and the possibility of conscription to an EU army. The ‘yes’ campaign tried to refute these arguments, but once planted in the public's mind, such emotive issues became difficult to neutralise. Farmers, traditionally one of the most pro‐European groups, also used the occasion of the Treaty to try to force the Government to concede that it would use a veto on any WTO deal that significantly worsened the position of Irish agriculture. The assurance eventually came, but not before farmers and fishermen had hardened their attitude.</p>
         
         <p>As well as its lack of enthusiasm, the ‘yes’ side made mistakes when campaigning. Cowen was characteristically honest when he admitted not having read the Treaty from cover to cover. He also engaged in party politics when criticising Fine Gael for not campaigning vigorously enough – in fact Fianna Fáil spent less than a quarter of what Fine Gael had spent on commercial advertising. Despite an early lead, as the campaign progressed the ‘yes’ side failed to pick up undecided voters where the ‘no’ side did. The result, an almost seven percentage point margin against the Treaty, was on a turnout of 53 per cent. This comparatively high turnout for a referendum made it more difficult to claim that the small number of anti‐Europeans had defeated an apathetic ‘yes’ side. Still the Irish government was asked by the EU to come up with a solution, and given Ireland's size, there was very little likelihood that it could force the other Member States to go back to negotiate a new treaty. As such, it left the Irish government very little option but to indicate that it would rerun the referendum in 2009.</p>

         <p>Cowen fell at the first hurdle of leadership in his failure to deliver the Lisbon Treaty, and his premiership managed to get significantly worse. The signs of an economic slowdown noted in last year's issue (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">O'Malley 2008</a></span>: 1014) became glaringly obvious by the end of the summer when the global economic slowdown took its full force. The precarious state of the Irish economy was subject to speculation, with the parlous public finances in particular open to scrutiny. Irish finances had recorded large surpluses for the previous number of years, but much of this was dependent on tax income that was linked to the ongoing property boom. In July it was revealed that first half tax returns were €3 billion lower than forecast. Such miscalculations set the tone for announcements from the Minister for Finance for the rest of the year. The tax shortfall was revised to €5 billion in early September and €7 billion a month later. In August, unions, employers' bodies and the government as well as other social partners failed to reach an agreement on pay for the coming years. Social partnership, a type of corporatist wage‐bargaining, was widely credited with Ireland's economic boom. In mid‐September a deal between the social partners was brokered, but by the end of 2008 it was clear that it would have to be renegotiated or ignored as the exchequer returns made any public sector pay increases unaffordable, and the economic downturn meant that few private sector employers could adhere to it.
         </p>
         
         <p>In its efforts to deal with the rapid deterioration of the country's finances, the Government brought forward its budget by two months to October. It increased taxes, through an ‘employment levy’, and reduced spending in all areas. One of the most controversial measures was the decision to remove the automatic entitlement to free healthcare for the over 70s. This caused sizeable protests by pensioners and a number of backbench TDs openly expressed their unhappiness with the measure. In the course of the controversy, the government lost two of its supporting TDs. Other cutbacks, or ‘savings’ as they are now known, in education also led to protests. The Government's handling of the economy was the most probable cause of the significant drop in support for Fianna Fáil, which according to opinion polls, had the support of between 25 and 30 per cent, down from almost 42 per cent in the election a year earlier.</p>
         
         <p>The international banking crisis was felt acutely in Ireland. Light regulation and over‐confidence in a bullish market meant that Irish banks lent very heavily during Ireland's property boom. It became clear that much of the paper value of their loans could not be realised. The share values of Irish banks were decimated, and fears of a run on the country's banks led the Government to offer a credit guarantee scheme, whereby all bank deposits were underwritten by the government, opening it to estimated potential liability of €400 billion. This controversial measure failed to lift confidence in the banks, and by the end of December the Minister for Finance introduced a recapitalisation programme whereby the state would inject up to €7.5 billion in three Irish banks. The crisis had hit the real economy as unemployment rose to 8.3 per cent in December, close to 300,000, which, in raw figures at least, was the country's highest ever total.
