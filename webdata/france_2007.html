         <p>Deputies and senators – the so‐called ‘Congress’– met twice in Versailles. On 4 February, 560 of them (against 181) voted to modify title XV of the 1958 Constitution in order to allow France to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon. The main question at stake was the balance between national and European legitimacy in legal matters. More important were the new rules voted on 23 July. First, they increased the power of the President of the Republic. Contrary to French tradition, he or she can now enter into the parliament (National Assembly and Senate) and deliver a speech explaining and justifying his or her policies (Article 18). Second, the role of the parliament is increased. The National Assembly and the Senate are allowed to control a part of their agendas, which since 1958 had been decided by the government. Each month, the opposition now has the right to determine the agenda (Article 23). The use of Article 49.3, which allows the government to pass a law without the vote of deputies and senators, is limited to financial topics (Article 24). Third, a combination of citizens and parliamentarians will be able to organise a popular referendum (Article 4). Citizens will be also able to refer laws to the High Council and, if freedom is concerned, the Constitutional Council (Articles 31 and 29). Some 559 parliamentarians supported the reform, with 357 voting against.</p>

         <p>Throughout the year, the President and his government continued to implement their reforms. The credo was to act quickly and cover a great deal of ground: some things were already in train, like immigration, crime and violence, pensions, while others were new, such as justice, health, education and environment. As far as the last issue was concerned, a relative consensus was established after the so‐called ‘Grenelle de l'environnement’ (a large conference bringing together associations, parties, unions and elected people at the national and local levels, which had taken place in December 2007). The participants shared a moderate optimism, but many difficulties appeared when the Government had to move from principles to concrete action (water, genetically modified foods (GMO) or development of renewable energy versus nuclear electricity).</p>
         
         <p>Other issues were very controversial. The first case was justice when large proportions of magistrates and of barristers opposed the Minister of Justice when she decided to get rid of some courts, particularly in rural or semi‐urban regions. The opponents stated that the reorganisation was just a question of money and that citizens would be the main victims. A similar argument was used against reform of the health sector. The Government dramatically reduced reimbursement for payments made by patients. Left‐wing parties, unions, doctors and chemists argued that France was moving to a two‐tier health system (one for the poor, the other for the privileged) and they were largely supported by public opinion. This controversy increased when the government announced plans to reform the public hospitals, which it claimed were inefficient and very expensive. The main idea was that it is possible to do better with less money and salaried people.</p>
         
         <p>The same principle was applied as far as the public sector was concerned. Some 12,000 posts had to be cut in 2008 and 30,000 were planned to go in 2009. Civil servants and workers in the public services went on strike and organised large demonstrations in order ‘to secure the future of the public sector’. Conflict only increased when it became clear that education, until now a sort of sanctuary, would be affected. It was not just teaching posts at stake: the Minister of Education undertook to reform programmes in secondary schools and to change the organisation of the universities and the research bodies. As a result, the crisis of confidence between the minister and stakeholders became global: teachers, professors, researchers, but also pupils, students and parents, opposed the minister's plans. In some circumstances (programmes, status of the professors and researchers in the universities), the Government had to draw back and negotiate new proposals with those concerned.</p>
         
         <p>In fact, too many reforms at the same time and in too great a hurry created a broad malaise. The French felt very anxious and lacked confidence in the ability of the president to deal with their main concern: purchasing power. Sarkozy was consistently unpopular: according to SOFRES surveys, only 37 per cent of the interviewed people thought, month after month, that he could ‘handle the problems that France had to face’. In March, the right‐wing camp lost the local elections (towns and departments). The left‐wing parties gained a majority in 59 additional towns and cities and eight departments. The consequence was a cabinet reshuffle. It was an attempt to show that the Government had heard the concerns of the citizenry. However, the appointment of new junior ministers for local communities, territorial planning and the Paris region also signified that the President would reform the country's administrative structure in order to limit the influence of the Socialist Party.</p>
         
         <p>In the autumn, political debate was more focused on the consequences of the financial and economic crisis. The President called for a ‘moralisation of capitalism’ and for new rules in the global financial system. As in other countries, the Government provided emergency loans to the banks. The issue was relatively consensual insofar as Sarkozy assured people that he was willing to control the use of funds and limit the pay and bonuses of bankers helped by the state. However, as unemployment began to increase, the President appointed in December a minister in charge of working out a plan for the revival in the industry.</p>
         
         <p>In conclusion, one could point out that the year was characterised by an increasing gap between, on the one hand, the ‘hyper president’, firm in his stances, who decided on all matters, who hoped to be not only to be the French president but also the leader of the European Union and, on the other hand, the French people, who either failed to understand what Sarkozy was up to or felt he was not listening to them.</p>
