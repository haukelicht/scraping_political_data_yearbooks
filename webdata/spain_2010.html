         <p>During 2010, several changes in Rodriguez Zapatero's cabinet took place. The Prime Minister announced on 20 October a sweeping range of ministerial changes that eliminated two national ministries and reshuffled the cabinet. The crisis has caused a reduction in the number of ministries in order to save and consolidate the economic reforms and to face the end of the Zapatero legislature with strength after pushing through approval of a hotly contested 2011 budget.</p>
         
         <p>Although a small reshuffle was expected after the Minister of Employment, Celestino Corbacho, quit to concentrate on his career in regional politics in Catalunya, the scale of the reshuffle took Spain by surprise. The main change involved the First Deputy Prime Minister – a position occupied since 2004 by Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega – which passed into the hands of Pérez Rubalcaba. The Minister will retain the portfolio of Home Affairs and also became the Government Spokesperson.</p>
         
         <p>Another major new feature is the entry into government of Valeriano Gómez, who was appointed Minister of Employment and Inmmigration after the departure of Celestino Corbacho, who decided to strengthen the Socialist Party ahead of the Autonomous elections in Catalunya. Gómez was the former Secretary General of Employment and he was also the previous head of the UGT trade union.</p>
         
         <p>The third change is related to the entry into the cabinet of a PSOE MEP and a veteran politician, Ramon Jaúregui, who took over the Ministry of the Presidency – until then the responsibility of Fernández de la Vega. Between 1995 and 1997 he served as Minister for Justice, Economy, Labour and Social Security. He is one of the politicians who best know the political situation in Euskadi and the counterterrorism policy.</p>
         
         <p>Trinidad Jiménez, Ministry of Health and Social Policy, who lost the Madrid socialist primaries to Tomas Gómez, replaced Miguel Angel Moratinos as Minister of Foreign Affairs. As a result, the Ministry of Health was occupied by Leire Pajín, previously the Organizing Secretary of the PSOE and number three in the party. She has management experience as Secretary of State for Cooperation in Zapatero's first cabinet. To take the place vacated by Pajín, Marcelino Iglesias has been appointed, and he combines his new role with his position as the President of Aragón, an Autonomous Community that he has governed since 1999 in coalition with a regionalist party, the PAR.</p>
         
         <p>The fifth change was in the Ministry of Rural, Marine and Environmental Affairs. Zapatero named as Minister, Rosa Aguilar, former mayor of IU in Córdoba who in 2009 held the portfolio of Public Works in the Autonomous Government of Andalusia as an independent.</p>
         
         <p>Furthermore, two Ministries disappeared (the Ministry of Housing and the Ministry of Equality, which were created only a few years ago in 2008) and their functions were absorbed into the Ministries of Health and Social Policy and the Ministry of Public Works, respectively.</p>
         
         <p>With this important reshuffle, the Zapatero Government faces the general election (to be held in late 2011) and the reforms with measures to recover the economy and to fight unemployment. Hours before the reshuffle, however, the Budget cleared its first hurdle when lawmakers voted to reject five blocking amendments. It still needs clearance from the Senate. The budget was approved by parliament at the end of the year.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>As well as the aforementioned institutional changes introduced in the government structure, the legislative atmosphere became more quiet and less adversarial in contrast to the former year and legislature (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Delgado &amp; López Nieto 2004</a></span>). On 27 June, the Constitutional Court delivered a verdict on the Catalan Statute of Autonomy after the PP denounced 114 articles (<span title=""><a href="#b2" id="#b2R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Delgado &amp; López Nieto 2006</a></span>). The political relevance of this issue for this institution, which is elected by the Cortes (Spanish bicameral parliament), and the delay in solving the aforementioned issue, had stopped its renovation. So after the verdict on the Catalan Statute, decided by six votes to four, the two main political parties, PSOE (Socialist) and PP (Popular), reached a partial agreement to remove some of the constitutional judges whose mandate had finished some time ago.
         </p>
         
         <p>This partial agreement was one of the scarce accords reached between these two main parties during Zapatero's presidency. Another important political agreement between the same two actors was reached during this year. It concerns a deep reform of the electoral bill, which does not affect the electoral system but does affect several aspects of the electoral process. An important part of this reform was introduced to limit the access to town halls for terrorists linked to the Basque group ETA (<span title=""><a href="#b3" id="#b3R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Delgado &amp; López Nieto 2007</a></span>) once the Government announced that it had cancelled the negotiation of a peace agreement with it. The results were two important bills that were approved by two main parties.
         </p>
         
         <p>However, the aforementioned political scenario was slightly less relevant than the economic and social one during this year because the Spanish rate of unemployment has been the largest in Europe. The Government expected to see the impact of the austerity plans set out in the first half of the year, parts of which were also approved by the main opposition party. In addition to their effect on household income, the measures adopted also bore down on government consumption and public investment. As a result, a slow recovery in the Spanish economy became linked to the budgetary austerity measures approved in May. Although economic data suggested a transitory weakening in economic activity due to the effects at the end of June of the so‐called ‘Plan 2000E’, a direct public aid programme for car purchases, and the rise in VAT from 1 July, the construction and service sectors still felt the impact of the loss of momentum in domestic expenditure, and employment continued to show no signs of recovery during this year. The unemployment rate rose to 19.8 per cent in a context in which there was a notable increase in apparent labour productivity. Indeed, inflation rose and averaged 2 per cent at the end of the year, reflecting the impact of the rise in VAT on final prices, and impacting on the inflation differential with the eurozone.</p>
         
         <p>During the first half of 2010, the Government, in collaboration with the Bank of Spain, ensured that the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) provided effective aid to the financial system during the process to restructure it and to strengthen its capital to encourage the recovery of economic activity. Moreover, the Government promoted, with the necessary consensus, regulatory changes that included reform of the Savings Bank Governing Bodies Act in order to strengthen the way it works.</p>
         
         <p>Wage increases negotiated in collective agreements fell further during the year, and employers and employees made use of the provisions offered by Law 35/2010 of 17 September 2010 on urgent labour market reform measures, which included the possibility of companies in a vulnerable economic situation resorting to wage opt‐out clauses. Foreseeable, unit labour costs continued to fall as a result of developments in productivity, which were still reflecting the intensity of job erosion over the course of this cyclical phase.</p>
         
         <p>Another measure taken during the year was related to the fight against fraud and the underground economy. Tax, labour and social security fraud affects the equality of all law‐abiding citizens and represents a social blight that was wholly incompatible with encouraging a sustainable economy. The financial sustainability of public administrations and the defence of the social model required a doubling of effort in the fight against the underground economy. The Government, through the tax authorities and the Labour and Social Security Inspectorate, presented an anti‐fraud action plan with new resources and instruments.</p>
         
         <p>In an attempt to stimulate innovation, the Government launched a national science, technology and innovation strategy and an integral industrial policy plan aimed at increasing the significance of industrial activity with measures in the area of regulation and reducing charges, training, industrial design and innovation, opening new markets and improving environmental sustainability. The plan covered both traditional and developing sectors, with special emphasis on the automotive sector, biotechnology and healthcare technologies, information and communication technologies, sectors related to environmental protection including renewable energy, and the aerospace sector. To coordinate the development and execution of this plan, an Inter‐Ministerial Commission on Industrial Policy was created to outline the participation instruments for social agents.</p>
         
         <p>At the same time, the Government presented a report at the Housing Sector Conference that evaluated the rate of adjustment for the residential construction sector and the effectiveness of the measures established to accelerate that adjustment, especially regarding finished housing units pending sale.</p>
         
         <p>Labour reform concentrated the efforts of the Government in order to renew the production model. The Government submitted to the Social Dialogue Board the proposed modifications to the labour legislation framework that were appropriate for improving the active policies, favouring the creation of employment, reducing the duality of the labour market, adapting labour relations to the real situation in companies and protecting workers’ rights. All these also included detailed proposals linked to the collective bargaining reform; promoting employment for young people as the sector hardest hit by the financial crisis; encouraging training and redeployment; reforming employment regulation mechanisms to help reduce the working day; improving labour mediation; reviewing public employment services and regulating the actions of private agents; reviewing the policy on bonuses; redirecting funds towards more efficient employment policies; controlling temporary disability processes; evaluating the functioning of the temporary protection programme for unemployment and insertion; increasing job stability, reducing labour segmentation; and adopting measures to develop the process of incorporating women into the job market, achieving real equality with regards to salaries.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> Regional elections</h2>
         
         <p>The leftist and nationalist Catalan coalition government formed by the <i>Partido Socialista de Cataluña</i> (Socialist Catalan Party, PSC), <i>Izquierda Republicana de Cataluña</i> (Republican Catalan Left, ERC) and <i>Iniciativa por Cataluña</i> (Catalan Initiative‐Greens, IC‐Greens) decided to call the ninth elections on the very last day of the legislature on 28 November. The abstention rate reached 41 per cent – 2 per cent more than in 2006. In the 2010 election, CiU increased its electoral support by seven points (38 per cent of the vote) and ten points in terms of seats (45.9 per cent). The three parties that comprised the former government lost electoral support in terms of votes: the Socialist Party lost eight points (it obtained just 18 per cent of the vote), the ERC lost exactly half of its former support (it won 7 per cent of vote share) and IC‐V lost two points (7 per cent of the vote). Three other parties entered the regional parliament: the Popular Party (12 per cent, an increase in votes of 2 per cent), and two small parties each with 3.5 per cent of the vote: a non‐nationalist party (Ciudadanos) and a new, independentist movement (Solidaridad Catalana por Independencia). The leader of the CIU, A. Mas, decided to form a minority government.
