         <p>The year 2017 was a period of change in Canadian politics. The three major opposition parties each chose new leaders, but made no inroads into the government's comfortable majority. The governing Liberals contributed to the change by shuffling their cabinet. The government again produced a budget with a massive deficit and proposed changes in the tax code that generated intense opposition. The Finance Minister and Prime Minister both became targets of investigations conducted by the Ethics Commissioner and the yesssssar ended with a report indicating that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had violated Conflict of Interest regulations. Negotiations with the new US government and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were launched and uncertainty about the status of Canada's major trade agreement caused concern. The year 2017 also marked the 150th anniversary of the Canadian federation, but the word ‘celebration’ was challenged and protests focused on the thousands of years of indigenous history, the need for change and the ongoing challenges of reconciliation.</p>

            <p>Elections were held in two of the ten provinces and one of the three territories, and notable changes occurred in two of them. In the west coast province of British Columbia, a long‐serving Liberal government managed a miniscule advantage in the popular vote (40.36 per cent to 40.28 per cent) and won two more seats than the opposition New Democrat Party (NDP) (43‐41). The provincial Green Party took almost one‐fifth of the vote and, with three seats, was able to determine the composition of the government (Elections BC, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12193-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12193-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). The Greens and NDP negotiated a formal agreement that committed the Greens to supporting the NDP on major issues and placed the NDP in power. The new arrangement raised questions about the future of a pipeline approved by the federal government in 2016 which would take Alberta oil to tidewater. The Liberal leader failed to become the first woman premier to be re‐elected despite the minor advantage she and her party secured on election night.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the east coast province of Nova Scotia, the governing Liberal party secured re‐election but saw its vote and seat count cut and barely held on to majority status. The Liberals received 39.5 per cent of the vote, the Progressive Conservatives 35.7 per cent, the NDP 21.5 per cent and the Greens 2.8 per cent. The Liberal vote fell by 6.2 percentage points and its seats fell from 33 of 51 to 27. The Progressive Conservatives climbed from 11 to 17 with the NDP seat total remaining at seven (Elections Nova Scotia, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12193-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12193-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The final election took place in the northern territory of Nunavut. Parties do not contest elections in that territory and all candidates compete as independents. Change was evident as incumbents held on to only 11 of the 22 seats. Just under three weeks later, members of the legislature were able to ask questions of their colleagues who were interested in serving as premier. A new premier was then elected by the members as well as a new cabinet which included only one holdover from the previous regime (See Ducharme, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12193-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12193-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span> and Frizzell, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12193-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12193-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).

         <p>In January 2017, the Liberal government began the year with a major cabinet change that saw three ministers, including two long‐serving Liberal MPs, one a former leader, shuffled out of their positions, with the two veterans leaving Parliament for diplomatic posts. The most prominent change resulted in Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland moving into Foreign Affairs, replacing former party leader Stéphane Dion, while retaining responsibility for trade relations with the United States. Three new ministers joined, one taking over the International Trade portfolio, another replacing veteran John McCallum as Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship and the third taking on responsibility for Democratic Institutions as her predecessor was given responsibilities for the Status of Women. One other minister, a former provincial NDP minister, was also removed from cabinet and her position as Minister of Employment was transferred to another minister who moved over from Status of Women.</p>
         
         <p>Later in the summer a six‐person shuffle followed the resignation of the Public Services Minister for family reasons. New ministers were brought in to take over Veterans Affairs and Health with the incumbents of those positions moving to other portfolios. The portfolio of Indigenous and Northern Affairs was split with the incumbent looking after Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs and the Health Minister moving to become Minister of Indigenous Services. The exiting Veterans Affairs minister took over Sport and Persons with Disabilities with that minister shifting to Public Services.</p>
         
         <p>Overall in 2017, four ministers left the cabinet, five newcomers were appointed, all elected to the House of Commons for the first time in 2015, and seven ministers were transferred to new responsibilities. The gender balance for which the Prime Minister was celebrated in 2015 remained as his cabinet appointments included 15 men and 15 women.</p>

         <p>The year 2017 outpaced 2016 in terms of changes in the composition of the House of Commons with 11 by‐elections. One Liberal MP, facing allegations of sexual harassment, moved to sit as an independent and two ministers who were shuffled out of cabinet left the House of Commons while another resigned for family reasons. Two Conservative MPs, including the former interim leader, also resigned, as did one other Liberal MP.</p>
         
         <p>By‐elections were held in April, October and December. In the five April by‐elections the outcomes were holds: two for the Conservatives and three for the Liberals. The October and December by‐elections were more challenging for the Conservatives despite their election of a new leader. In October they lost a Quebec seat to the Liberals, and in December the Liberals took a seat away from them in British Columbia. The Conservatives retained two other seats as did the Liberals. There were no victories for the NDP or the Bloc Québécois this year.</p>

         <p>The Conservatives, NDP and Bloc Québécois all chose new leaders. The Bloc was the first to choose and, in March, a member of the Quebec National Assembly, and a former Parti Québécois cabinet minister, Martine Ouellet, was acclaimed as party leader; none of the ten elected MPs put their names forward. Ouellet had twice unsuccessfully sought the leadership of the Parti Québécois and had advocated for a referendum on independence to be held in the first term of a Parti Québécois government. Ouellet chose not to resign from the provincial legislature following her victory, but shifted her status in that assembly to independent.</p>
         
         <p>In May the official opposition Conservative party chose Andrew Scheer as its new leader. He is a former speaker of the House of Commons and took 13 ballots to emerge victorious. He led only on the final ballot and narrowly edged his caucus colleague Maxine Bernier who led every other ballot.</p>
         
         <p>Sixteen candidates sought the leadership with 13 remaining in the contest as the voting took place. The party used a weighted voting system giving each of the 338 federal constituencies 100 points. All party members could vote and points were allocated in proportion to the vote each candidate received. Voting followed a preferential format in which the lowest ranked candidate on each ballot was removed and their ballots redistributed according to the next preference. The 141,362 votes cast by members were higher than those cast in any previous federal race for any party. Scheer's margin of victory was actually higher in the popular vote than it was with the weighting.</p>
         
         <p>The final new leader, Jagmeet Singh, defeated three other candidates and won a first ballot in the NDP leadership race in October. The party used an all‐member vote in which voters cast preferential votes for the candidates. Singh is ‘the first leader of a major federal party who is not white’ (Ballingall, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12193-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12193-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). His campaign was very successful in selling memberships and he garnered 54 per cent of the 65,792 votes cast. Singh, a member of the Ontario Provincial Parliament at the time of his selection, has not held federal office previously.

         <p>Changes in cabinet and in the leadership of the opposition parties attracted much of the political attention in 2017. However, the changes to the Canadian Senate introduced by Prime Minister Trudeau in 2016 continued to have an impact. The growing independence of the Senate is attracting attention from lobbyists. Independent Senators now outnumber Liberals and Conservatives in the upper chamber and records indicate 1250 reports of meetings between lobbyists and Senators. In 2016, there were 687 reports and just 217 in 2015. The increased attention seems warranted by the willingness of the unelected body to make changes. An increasing number of government bills passed have changes that were suggested by the Senate. The Senate also flexed its muscles in suggesting that part of the government's budget bill should be split.</p>
         
         <p>In the 2017 budget, the Liberals projected a deficit of more than C$25 billion while arguing that they were presenting an economic plan focused on delivering economic growth and the creation of middle‐class jobs. Improvements in tax fairness were also part of the Liberal plan and the budget indicated that changes would be forthcoming. When these proposals were released they included changes relating to the conversion of income into capital gains and ending ‘tax sprinkling’, which involved paying salaries to family members in order to reduce tax payments. Substantial criticism of the proposed changes was advanced by the new Conservative leader as well as self‐employed groups representing doctors and farmers.</p>
         
         <p>The Liberal ability to defend their changes was affected by charges that the Finance Minister had not put all his assets into a blind trust when he entered cabinet and had failed to disclose his ownership of some property in France. Pressure on the Finance Minister increased with news that the Ethics Commissioner had launched an investigation into questions relating to conflict of interest and the ability of the minister to benefit financially from changes introduced with respect to pension reform. The minister indicated that he would be donating any profits to charity and would be placing his assets into a blind trust. By year's end the general conclusions of the commission had not been released but the minister had been fined C$200 for not reporting on his property in France.</p>
         
         <p>The Ethics Commissioner did release, in late December, a ruling indicating that the Prime Minister had violated Conflict of Interest legislation with a family visit, in late December 2016 and early January 2017, to a private island owned by the Aga Khan (Jimenez, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12193-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12193-bib-0010R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). The Prime Minister's visit included accepting hospitality on the island, a trip to the island on a private aircraft and a failure to recuse himself from discussions relating to the Aga Khan's foundation, an organization which was registered to lobby the Canadian government. The commissioner rejected the Prime Minister's contention that this was a visit with friends, suggesting that:

            </p>
<blockquote class="quote" id="">
<p>there were no private interactions between Mr. Trudeau and the Aga Khan until Mr. Trudeau became Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. This led me to conclude that their relationship cannot be described as one of friends for the purposes of the Act. (Dawson, <span title=""><a href="#epdy12193-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12193-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>, 2)</p>
               <div class="source"></div>
            </blockquote>
         
         
         <p>The Prime Minister apologized for the mistake, but in combination with the issues surrounding the Finance Minister's assets, the impact on the image of the government was negative.</p>
         
         <p>Dealing a further blow to the government's image was the decision not to proceed any further with reforming the electoral system. Despite his party's promise of change in the 2015 election and a series of parliamentary discussions and town hall consultations, the government decided to drop any further efforts at putting in place a new voting system. While expressing guarded support for a system of preferential voting, the Prime Minister was very clear in rejecting any move to proportional representation. The appointment of a new Minister for Democratic Institutions drew a line under the issue and the letter outlining priorities for the new minister made clear that changes to the electoral system were not part of the mandate.</p>
         
         <p>Relations with the United States grew more complicated as their new President, Donald Trump, took office in January and throughout the year Canada began the process of renegotiating the NAFTA agreement with the United States and Mexico. Renegotiations on the 23‐year‐old agreement with Canada's largest trading partner had not yielded results at the end of 2017 and there was concern about US desires to do away with the dispute‐resolution procedures which had been critical to the 1994 deal. Five rounds of negotiation took place during the year, but no agreement was reached.</p>
         
         <p>Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples continued to attract attention, particularly given controversy over celebrating Canada's 150th birthday. The government issued an apology to survivors of residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrasssdor, renamed a block of the federal parliament to remove the name of a federal politician associated with the residential schools policy and instituted changes in government structures dealing with indigenous issues. The creation of a new minister with responsibility for Indigenous Services was accompanied by a transfer of some services from other departments and the hope that this would make it easier to improve the conditions in which Indigenous people live. Prime Minister Trudeau indicated that he wanted to move beyond the Indian Act and develop more of a ‘Nation to Nation’ relationship.</p>
