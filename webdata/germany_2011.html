In cases where a change of government occurred without a previous election, this will be indicated. The first party is always the party of the Prime Minister. 3The Bundesrat has 69 members. Regular decisions require a majority of 35 votes. If the Bundesrat rejects Bundestag legislation by a two‐thirds majority (46 votes), the Bundestag needs a two‐thirds majority to overrule this decision. Individual Länder cannot split their votes. For more details, see Poguntke (2001: fn 6). During the tenure of the CDU/FDP government, the rules of counting are as follows: ‘government’ camp includes single party CDU or CSU governments, CDU‐FDP and CSU‐FDP coalitions; the ‘opposition’ camp includes single party SPD governments and coalitions including SPD, Greens, Left; and the ‘mixed’ camp includes a combination of parties from both government and opposition camps.<span class="chevronDown"></span></span>

         <p>The year 2011 in Germany was characterised by some marked departures from familiar patterns and by ongoing crises. As in the previous year, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) did not manage to improve its catastrophic poll ratings and corresponding Land election results. The party just crossed the 5 per cent hurdle in its traditional heartland of Baden‐Württemberg and did not win seats in five out of six other Land elections. The replacement of the longstanding party chair Guido Westerwelle by the young Philipp Rösler did not have any noticeable effect.</p>
         
         <p>Equally, the Christian Democrats found themselves in difficult and uneven terrain. Only a few months after she had pushed through a pro‐nuclear turn in Germany's energy strategy (Poguntke <span><a href="#epdy12-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>), and shortly after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, Chancellor Merkel suspended the decisions of autumn 2010. Following a defeat at the Baden‐Württemberg Land elections, where the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) lost the premiership for the first time ever (to a Green Prime Minister!), Merkel pushed for another U‐turn in that the government now wanted to phase out nuclear production even faster than had been decided a decade earlier by the red–green government under Gerhard Schröder. On 1 July, the Bundestag passed legislation which will terminate nuclear energy production by 2022. This was clearly also an attempt to counter the Green surge in the polls, with the Greens reaching poll ratings well above 20 per cent in 2011 and winning the premiership in Baden‐Württemberg, while the CDU was relegated to third place in the Bremen Land elections of May. Even though Bremen had never been a Christian Democratic stronghold, it was widely noticed that the CDU finished behind the Greens for the first time ever in a Land election.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Berlin Land elections of 18 September marked another major watershed in German electoral politics. At the outset of the campaign a Green victory did not seem unlikely because they had overtaken the Social Democrats in the polls. In the end, their high hopes did not materialise despite their best ever result in Berlin. Arguably, this was partially due to the unexpectedly strong performance of the Pirate Party, which came from nowhere to win 8.9 per cent of the vote. Their core concern is the protection of freedom on the Internet and the expansion of popular participation in politics via the Internet.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the year, German politics continued to be occupied with the euro crisis and an increasingly controversial debate about the financial burden that it might impose on the German taxpayer. There was a substantial internal debate within the Christian Social Union (CSU) about this, and the FDP leadership even faced a membership referendum initiated by a eurosceptic Liberal MP. In the end, the pro‐European forces prevailed and turnout remained below 30 per cent. Yet it became evident that the days of the pro‐European permissive consensus are definitely over in Germany and European issues had finally reached the centre of the domestic political debate. This allowed Chancellor Merkel to gain a strong domestic reputation as a result of her highly visible involvement in European politics – not least when she successfully pushed for the fiscal pact which was agreed in December. This made her almost untouchable within her own Christian Democratic Party (CDU) even though Land election results tended to be rather poor.</p>
         
         <p>The attempts to rescue the euro also had significant constitutional repercussions. In reaction to the need to decide quickly and confidentially about funds released in the context of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the decisions were relegated to a small select committee of the Bundestag. This restriction of parliamentary involvement in budgetary matters was halted by the Federal Constitutional Court in October by means of an injunction. The Court emphasised that it was only permissible to restrict the right of the plenary to decide on important budgetary matters under very specific circumstances.</p>
         
         <p>Another major controversy centred on the Stuttgart railway station construction project, which continued to attract widespread attention (Poguntke <span><a href="#epdy12-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>). The controversy contributed to the ousting of the Christian‐Liberal Land government and represented a considerable bone of contention for the new green–red government because the SPD was officially in favour of the project while the Greens were opposed. The issue was resolved by putting it to a referendum, and on 27 November, 58.8 per cent backed the continuation of the project, including 52.9 per cent in Stuttgart itself.
         </p>
         
         <p>The year 2011 was a difficult year for German political elites. It began with the disclosure that a rising star of the CSU, Defence Minister Karl‐Theordor zu Guttenberg, had plagiarised his PhD in Law. After a painstaking debate, this led to his resignation. Within weeks, the Internet‐based network that had discovered the offence uncovered a number of similar cases, which led to other members of the political elite losing their valued doctoral titles, including Free Democratic Party (FDP) Vice‐President of the European Parliament Silvana Koch‐Mehrin. Arguably even more damaging for the reputation of the political elite was a scandal involving President of the Republic Christian Wulff which gained momentum in late 2011 and eventually led to his resignation in February 2012. It emerged that the President had accepted all kinds of favours from so‐called ‘friends’ and his position became untenable when the public prosecutor's office launched an official investigation.</p>
         
         <p>Amid the heated debates over the euro crisis and the shifting party political landscape, it went largely unnoticed by the general public that the Bundestag did not manage to meet a deadline set by the Constitutional Court to reform the federal election law. The reform had become necessary because the German electoral system can produce disproportional effects as a result of the two‐vote system and two‐tier seat allocation which first allocates seats on the federal level and then decides the actual number of seats in each of the Länder. Some three months after the deadline, the reform was passed by the governing coalition against the opposition parties in September, but the opposition parties immediately announced that they would appeal against it at the Constitutional Court. While a decision was not reached in 2011, the Court ruled in November that the 5 per cent hurdle is unconstitutional for European elections.</p>
         
         <p>In November, two right‐wing terrorists committed suicide as the police were about to arrest them. It soon became apparent that they had, over the course of a decade, killed ten people, mainly immigrants, but the police had not discovered that the murder series had had an extreme right‐wing background.</p>
