         <p>The year opened with national politics still mired in the parliamentary stalemate produced by the general election in 2004 and then reinforced by another in 2006. Canadian politicians, and much of the media punditry, seem unwilling to accept the realities of minority government and so mark time with increasing impatience until another election can be held in the hopes of returning the country to the ‘normal’ state of majority government. However, given that the Conservative Government had (in spring 2007) persuaded Parliament to establish a system of fixed election dates, the prospect was for another frustrating year as the next election was not scheduled to be held until 19 October 2009.</p>
         
         <p>Canada's ongoing active military presence in Afghanistan had been a highly divisive issue throughout 2007. Early in 2008 the report of a blue ribbon task force, chaired by a former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, made a vigorous case for a continuing Canadian commitment to the mission, arguing against an early or precipitous withdrawal. This led many Liberals to soften their position and the party came to an agreement with the Government that produced a parliamentary vote reaffirming a troop commitment until 2011. This took the heat out of an issue that appeared to have the potential to bring down the Government. Still, with the New Democrats and the Bloc Québécois voting against the Government as a matter of course, this left the Liberals, unprepared for an election, in the unhappy position of continuing to oppose the Government while having to either abstain or vote for it in parliamentary divisions.</p>
         
         <p>The Government hit a major bump in the road when the Minister of Foreign Affairs was forced to resign when it was discovered that he had left a set of classified briefing materials in the home of a former girlfriend. The story got extensive media coverage, in part so the newspapers could repeatedly print pictures of the woman in question in a rather revealing dress. The political problem stemmed from the fact that the minister in question was from Quebec, a province where the Government hoped to make substantial gains. It took the Prime Minister a month to make the necessary adjustments to his cabinet and by then he was beginning to contemplate ignoring his own fixed election date law in an attempt to avoid the political consequences of a slowing economy.</p>
         
         <p>Taking many by surprise, the Prime Minister claimed that the law was meant to apply only to normal parliaments, not dysfunctional (read minority) ones and then, on 7 September, he called an election for 14 October (effectively canceling four by‐elections already underway). As the campaign started, the polls showed the Conservatives with a lead of about ten percentage points over the Liberals, but with a vote share unlikely to give them a majority. Much would therefore depend on the campaign. The Prime Minister argued that in times of global economic uncertainty, Canadians should vote for the Conservatives as the party that offered common sense and stability. This claim was pointed directly at the Liberal leader, Stéphane Dion, who the Conservatives had continually painted as hopelessly ineffective from the day of his selection in late 2006. Dion's awkwardness on English television, and his policy commitment of a ‘Green Shift’ that would involve a significant carbon tax (coupled with reduced income taxes) left the Liberals with a campaign that attracted little enthusiasm or support. Much to their distress, however, the Conservatives were not able to capitalise on Liberal failures. Quebec, and the rapidly worsening economic climate, eventually stymied them.</p>
         
         <p>To win a majority the Conservatives believed they needed to make inroads in Quebec and so for two years their government had lavished considerable attention and resources on the province. However, modest cutbacks in arts programmes and the Conservatives' proposed changes to sentencing provisions for young offenders were attacked by Quebec's elites, allowing the Bloc to portray them as inimical to the province's values. The Bloc's poll numbers soon grew as the Conservative's collapsed. The national campaign focused on the economy as the Prime Minister had wanted, but as the weeks went by it became clear that the situation was quickly becoming far more serious than many had realised. However, Prime Minister Harper, in contrast to the more dynamic Barack Obama whose campaign was also being watched (and envied) on Canadians' televisions, offered little more than the promise of steady management and the observation that it might be a good time to find bargains in the financial markets. His apparent lack of empathy for the challenges facing ordinary voters left the undecided and the uncommitted more receptive to the opposition parties' claim that the Government did not deserve their support.</p>
         
         <p>Inevitably, a number of other stories emerged to colour the election. Despite the Liberals' inability to achieve any traction for their Green Shift programme, the Green Party had more of a presence than ever, nominating 303 candidates, forcing their leader into the televised leaders' debates and running a national campaign. The Greens' vote grew by about 40 per cent but despite almost a million votes the electoral system denied it any MPs. In Newfoundland, the Conservative provincial premier, opposed to the national Conservative government's treatment of his province, launched an ABC (‘Anyone But Conservative’) campaign with the result that the party did not manage to elect a single member there.</p>
         
         <p>The election failed to energise and mobilise Canadians, more of whom would have preferred to vote for Obama had he been on their ballot. As a consequence, voter turnout dropped yet again, to just under 59 per cent of registered electors – the lowest figure ever recorded in a national general election. For the third time in just four years no party won a majority. The Conservatives gained more votes, and increased the size of their caucus, but returned to office disappointed that they could not win a majority; the Liberals saw their vote share fall for the third election in a row to its lowest level in history; while the New Democrats had to be content with modest increases. The Bloc held its own and, with 16 per cent of the seats for its 10 per cent of the vote, judged the election a success. Indeed, as long as the Bloc can continue to command up to 50 seats in a 308‐seat parliament the prospects for forming a majority government must continue to be slim.</p>
         
         <p>Harper's second government was sworn in on 30 October and it appeared as if national politics was simply about to resume as before. The number of ministers remained the same, but there was an increase, from 5 to 11, in the number of Secretaries of State (a kind of junior minister) as the Prime Minister created more jobs for his larger caucus. The House met on 18 November and re‐elected Liberal Peter Milliken as Speaker for a fourth term – an indication that members in all parties respected his leadership in a very divided House. The Government's Speech from the Throne opening the new parliament signaled that it hoped to work with members from all parties on the big issues of global finance, job preservation, energy supply and climate change. However, the speech also served notice that the Government wanted to pursue its plans for Senate reform and representation by population (for the big underrepresented provinces). The latter ought to have set off alarm bells for the Bloc as it would inevitably dilute Quebec's strength in the House.</p>
         
         <p>Declarations of cross‐party cooperation vanished just eight days later when, in an economic update statement from the Minister of Finance, the Government announced it intended to end the system of annual public subsidies for political parties. The opposition parties saw this as a declaration of total war and within four days generated an accord to provide the basis for a coalition government. Under their plan, the Liberals and New Democrats would form a government (headed by a Liberal Prime Minister) with a side‐promise from the Bloc to support it for at least eighteen months. They announced they intended to defeat the Conservative Government and indicated to the Governor General that they were prepared to assume office. This was totally unprecedented in Canadian national politics and was soon being described as a political crisis. The Conservatives protested that this was essentially unconstitutional on the grounds that only voters could choose a government, and they just had. They declared that any coalition dependent on support from the separatist Bloc was politically unacceptable – an argument many saw as effectively relegating Bloc MPs to a second‐class status. Though this was hardly likely to win support from Quebec, the Conservatives were desperate to save their government. Harper went to the Governor General (who was rushed home from a European trip) on the morning of 4 December and persuaded her to prorogue Parliament until late January. So, after only eleven sitting days, the first session of the 40th parliament came to an end with the country's politics in more turmoil than ever.</p>
         
         <p>Having been out‐manoeuvered, the Liberal Party took stock with many blaming their leader for mishandling the situation. Dion, who had in the aftermath of the election results indicated that he would resign the leadership at a spring convention, now came under increasing pressure to resign, and by the Monday of the following week announced he was stepping aside. Leadership selection in the Liberal Party normally takes place after a campaign of several months at a convention of thousands of party members from across the country. This time the party was anxious to settle the matter before Parliament resumed. Three candidates expressed interest, but pressure from caucus members and other prominent Liberals led two to withdraw and two days later Michael Ignatieff was declared the interim leader in a caucus meeting. His leadership is to be confirmed at the next party convention, but it was clear by the end of the year that he had taken control. Ignatieff had lived outside the country for most of the period from 1978 to 2005, returning only to (successfully) contest a seat in the 2006 general election. He had run for the leadership in the aftermath of the party's election defeat that year, but despite leading on the first ballot, eventually lost to Dion. The Liberals expect him to rebuild the party's organisation and finances, and restore them to their long dominant position as the country's ‘natural governing party’. It will be a big job, with the first test being whether to pursue or abandon the coalition strategy when Parliament resumes in January.</p>
         
         <p>With Parliament shut down, most assumed that the year's political surprises had come to an end – not so. On the Monday of Christmas week the Prime Minister startled the country with the announcement that he was appointing 18 new Senators. His policy to that point had been to move toward a major reform that would see Senators elected for limited terms. As a way of forcing that agenda, he had quite deliberately left Senate vacancies unfilled in an attempt to make the chamber increasingly unworkable. Now he was completely reversing his position, packing the Senate with individuals committed to supporting his reform agenda, and promising more of the same when vacancies occur in the new year.</p>
         
         <p>It was a quieter year for provincial politics. In Alberta, the Progressive Conservative Government won over half the vote and was re‐elected for the tenth consecutive time since coming to office in 1971. In the northern Territory of Nunavet, members of its 17‐person non‐party Assembly choose a premier and cabinet members for its consensus‐style government by secret ballot. In the aftermath of an October election, the newly elected members selected a first‐term member as the territory's first woman premier. Quebec's politics had been more unpredictable since the province's 2007 election returned a minority Liberal Government. Anxious to reassert his position, the Premier called a sudden election for December, claiming he needed a mandate to deal with the gathering economic crisis. Though turnout dropped to just 56 per cent, his electoral gamble was successful and the Quebec Liberal Party was returned with a majority in the National Assembly.</p>
         
         <p>For those still convinced that electoral reform is the answer for stagnant or unrepresentative party politics, the promise of another referendum (in May 2009) on the British Columbia Citizens' Assembly recommendation for single‐transferrable voting (STV) (<span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2006</a></span>) provides what is likely to be their final opportunity.
         </p>
         
         <p>The year ended with the nation's politics in confusion and few certain about what shape it would take in the next one. Yet having lived through three minority election outcomes in quick succession, Canadians were slowly coming to grips with the prospect of finding new ways to do politics. The real question for the new year was would the politicians be up to the task?</p>
