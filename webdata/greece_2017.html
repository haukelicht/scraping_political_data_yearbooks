         <p>The Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) and the Independent Hellenes (ANEL) governed with a slight majority in parliament (153 of 300 seats in January 2017). The coalition government ultimately closed the second review of the August 2015 Greek bailout programme, but relations with the country's lenders remained strained and the third review had only <i>informally</i> closed by the end of the year. The main dispute between the governing coalition and the opposition was about whether Greece would be able to secure a ‘clean’ bailout exit in August 2018 – when the current bailout programme ends – and return to the bond markets. Most polls suggested a stable lead of the main opposition party, New Democracy (ND), over SYRIZA, and a relative revival of the ‘Center Left’. The refugee crisis no longer made headlines, but problems persisted. There were some positive signs in the economy, including a decrease in unemployment to 21 per cent and record‐breaking tourist arrivals; full‐year gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2017 came to 1.4 per cent. Investment, however, dropped to 11 per cent of GDP from 26 per cent of GDP in 2007.

         <p>In 2017, the cabinet did not experience any changes at the ministerial level (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12201-tbl-0001">1</a>). Even though many pundits expected a cabinet reshuffle and several members of SYRIZA called for one within 2017, Prime Minister Tsipras decided to keep his cabinet intact – partly not to upset the negotiations with creditors and the completion of the third review.

         <p>There were small changes across parliamentary groups during 2017 compared with recent years. SYRIZA, ANEL and the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) remained intact. ND welcomed an independent lawmaker, initially voted into parliament with The River (P), Iason Fotilas; but ND leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis expelled one of his MPs, Katerina Papakosta, because she strayed from the party line. Thus, ND remained with the same overall number of MPs. Both Golden Dawn (XA) and The River experienced two resignations and the Union of Centrists had one. Thus, the number of independents grew. The Democratic Coalition (Panhellenic Socialist Movement/PASOK and Democratic Left/DIMAR) was the only party that grew its numbers in 2017, from 16 to 19. The three additions to this parliamentary group included two MPs voted into parliament with The River and the return of Leonidas Grigorakos, who had been expelled from the Democratic Coalition for making positive statements concerning Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the possibility of a collaboration with ND (Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0020" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0020R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017a</a></span>: 118). The overall number of women in parliament remained the same (see Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12201-tbl-0002">2</a>).

         <p>In May, all SYRIZA and ANEL MPs ratified the prior actions to conclude the second review, including new pension cuts and tax hikes through 2020. The vote took place amidst protests by trade unions of public‐ and private‐sector employees. A month later the Eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg concluded the second review of Greece's economic adjustment programme allowing the European Stability Mechanism to proceed with the disbursement of the next tranche of financial assistance to Greece (€8.5 billion). In December, all SYRIZA and ANEL MPs approved the 2018 state budget, while 144 opposition MPs rejected it and three were absent. The budget included further austerity measures stretching beyond the end of the bailout programme in 2018 (Papadimas <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0022" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0022R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>Turning to developments in Brussels, Kostas Chrysogonos, Member of the European Parliament (MEP) elected with SYRIZA, severed ties with the party in October over differences in policy (Kathimerini <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0008" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0008R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017a</a></span>). Thus, of the six MEPs that SYRIZA elected in 2014 only three were still supporting SYRIZA by the end of 2017. Nikos Houndis joined Popular Unity in 2015 and Sophia Sakorafa became an independent MEP. Importantly the trend of citizens’ waning support for the Eurozone and the European Union as well as lower trust of political institutions, both national and European, continued in 2017.

         <p>ND sustained a clear lead over Tsipras’ SYRIZA during 2017. This polling reality took shape over a period of two years. SYRIZA halted its downward trajectory in the polls toward the end of 2017, but whether it can reverse this trajectory in future public opinion polls or in elections remains to be seen.</p>
         
         <p>SYRIZA and Tsipras in particular tried to rebrand themselves, but often through a mix of contradictory messages. Tsipras made a systematic attempt to present SYRIZA as a social democratic, centre‐left party, while at the same time presenting himself as good for business and entrepreneurship. SYRIZA tried to broaden its appeal by behaving like a catchall party, yet it is unclear whether SYRIZA's electorate – traditionally against privatizations and foreign investments – will remain intact (Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0021" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0021R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017b</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>SYRIZA promised a ‘clean exit’ from the bailout programmes in 2018. The main opposition party, ND, expressed serious doubts. In December, ND held a party convention. The party leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, called on party officials and supporters to join forces to replace ‘the worst government in the post‐dictatorship era’ (Kathimerini <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0009R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017b</a></span>). ND has experienced a rejuvenation since the recent election of Mitsotakis – son of Konstantinos Mitsotakis, former Prime Minister and leader of ND (1984–93), who died on 29 May 2017–but this is not without its own challenges (Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0020" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0020R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017a</a></span>). The party may have reached the limits of its growth potential, given the high levels of consolidation reported in recent polls. Finally, internal fighting over the direction of the party (liberal versus right‐wing) has traditionally plagued the party and still does. ND's goal is not to just win the next election but also to form a government. To this effect, Mitsotakis also reached out to the leadership of the self‐described ‘Center Left’ political family (PASOK‐DIMAR/The River) since it may need its support to form a government.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ‘Center Left’ polled an average of 10 per cent in the last trimester of 2017. This modest ‘revival’ followed the internal elections for a new leader for the ‘Center Left.’ Ten candidates ran including the leader of PASOK‐DIMAR, Fofi Gennimata; Athens Mayor Yiorgos Kaminis; Stavros Theodorakis, party leader of The River; and PASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Movement) MEP Nikos Androulakis. In the first round on 12 November, Gennimata came first with 42 per cent of the vote, while Androulakis came second with 25 per cent of the vote. A total of 212,000 people participated. A runoff round took place a week later between the two frontrunners. Gennimata won with 56 per cent of the vote. Following the elections, the parliamentary groups of The River and PASOK‐DIMAR decided to remain independent until the new party's founding conference scheduled for March 2018.</p>

         <p>Minor parties, such as the Union of Centrists and ANEL, hovered around the 3 per cent threshold necessary to enter parliament. Things were fragmented to the left of SYRIZA where several parties attempt to pull voters away from SYRIZA, but were polling below 3 per cent: Popular Unity (LAE), led by former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis; Plefsis Eleftherias, led by the former President of the parliament Zoe Konstantopoulou; and possibly a party led by former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. All three figures were prominent SYRIZA MPs until August 2015 (Mylonas <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0019" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0019R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).

         <p>Greece pledged to carry out ambitious reforms and privatizations as part of the third bailout package under which it received billions of euros in emergency loans to overhaul its economy. The Unified Social Security Institution (EFKA) was established in January. It is an umbrella social security fund unifying the multiple previous organizations under one administration. Social security contribution rates went up, and pensions were further cut. Turning to privatizations, Fraport Greece commenced the 40‐year concession for managing and developing 14 regional airports in April. Greece received €1.234 billion upfront payment and Fraport Greece will invest about €400 million more for improving and expanding the airports’ infrastructure by 2021. The 14 airports managed by Fraport Greece serviced 27.6 million passengers in 2017. Italian state railway group Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane completed its acquisition of Greek national train operator Trainose in September, when the €45 million transaction was officially closed during an Italy–Greece bilateral summit. A 24‐hour strike by the railway workers union immediately followed the company's sale.</p>
         
         <p>In October, the Athens transport ticket system transitioned from paper tickets to electronic plastic smartcards. The project is part of the Partnership Agreement for the Development Framework 2014–2020 plan and was funded by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) of the European Union. An announcement that paper tickets for multiple journeys would cease to be sold at the end of October resulted in huge lines of people at metro stations seeking to buy electronic tickets. The full implementation of these measures was postponed.</p>
         
         <p>Greek banks continued to be burdened by bad loans clogging up their balance sheets and holding back lending in 2017. The total of so‐called non‐performing exposures (NPEs) amounted to €101.8 billion at the end of June 2017 – 50.6 per cent of their total loans. The European Central Bank (ECB) expects this to be reduced by €38 billion by the end of 2019. Eurobank, Greece's third largest lender, decided to sell a €1.5 billion pool of non‐performing loans to Sweden's Intrum on 5 October as part of efforts to reduce its load of bad debt and meet targets agreed with regulators.</p>
         
         <p>Beyond privatizations and the austerity measures, there were more legislative initiatives. One that attracted media attention and generated public debate was the legal gender change law. In October, the government put forth a law permitting the change of gender in official documents without sterilization. The bill passed with 171 votes in favor and 114 against out of the 285 present in Greece's 300‐seat parliament. The only opposition party that supported the bill was The River. The main opposition party, ND, did not support the initiative over disagreement concerning the age requirement. ND's leader, Mitsotakis, argued it was wrong ‘to extend such life‐changing decisions to people under the age of 18’ (Smith <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0024" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0024R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017a</a></span>). The article of the bill, which stipulated the age limit for a citizen to change their gender with a court ruling and without a medical operation would be 15 years, garnered the support of 148 MPs of the 285 present – an indication that the governing coalition parties, SYRIZA and ANEL, experienced problems with the party line. LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) activists said the law was a step in the right direction, but not enough to establish ‘full self‐determination’ for transgender people (BBC News <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). The Greek Orthodox Church opposed the bill, described it as ‘immoral’ and asked for it to be withdrawn.

         <p>While 2017 can be characterized as one of the least turbulent years of the crisis, it was still eventful. On 25 May, the former Prime Minister Lucas Papademos was the victim of a terrorist attack. He was injured, along with two Bank of Greece employees, as a result of opening an envelope containing a hidden explosive device. Papademos had navigated Greece through austerity measures over a six‐month period beginning in late 2011 heading a ‘technocratic’ government. Suspicions fell on a home‐grown group, the Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei, which claimed responsibility for sending letter bombs to the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and the Paris offices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On 7 November, shots were fired at police guarding the headquarters of PASOK. There were no injuries during the shooting, which occurred at a busy intersection in Athens. Police found four shells fired from a Kalashnikov AK‐47 rifle.</p>
         
         <p>Members of the anarchist group Rouvikonas (Rubicon) organized several attacks during the year. In July, they entered the offices of the Bank of Greece in central Athens, scattered leaflets and chanted slogans before fleeing. In November, they targeted the premises of the Defense Ministry, fuelling concerns about the security of key government offices and provoking vehement criticism from the opposition. In December they threw paint at the entrance of the Israeli Embassy in Athens and posted a video of the attack.</p>
         
         <p>In January, a scandal broke involving the management of the Hellenic Society for the Protection of Intellectual Property (AEPI) following a report by chartered accountants Ernst &amp; Young that revealed egregious mismanagement of funds. AEPI represents 14,540 Greek artists and around 2.2 million foreign artists through representation contracts. Accusations included embezzling, forming a criminal gang, breach of trust, tax evasion and money laundering.</p>
         
         <p>In June, a court of appeals sentenced a 29‐year‐old graduate student to 13 years of imprisonment for participation in a terrorist organization and illegal gun ownership. Civil society groups protested the decision, but to no avail.</p>
         
         <p>The legal battle surrounding Greece's former statistics chief, Andreas Georgiou, continued in 2017 when an Athens appeal court handed Georgiou a two‐year suspended sentence for ‘violating’ his duties during the country's sovereign debt crisis (Hope <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). Another appeals court had acquitted him just a few months earlier. Georgiou was accused of damaging the country's interests, violating internal procedures, defaming colleagues and continued allegiance to his former employer, the IMF. Some see Georgiou as a scapegoat to divert attention from the responsibilities of the ND government that ruled just before the financial crisis hit (Hope <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0006R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). Senior officials from the European Commission and the ECB voiced concerns the trials could deter investors while also undoing years of work to restore faith in Greece's institutions.
         </p>
         
         <p>The number of refugees arriving in Greece dropped since the European Union–Turkey deal in March 2016, but the situation during 2017 was still critical. Almost 1500 unaccompanied minors and more than 13,000 refugees were stranded on Greek islands, according to figures released by the Greek Ministry of Interior (Smith <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0025" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0025R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017b</a></span>). To help ease the overcrowded conditions at the reception and information centres (RICs) on the islands, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) – in coordination with the Greek government – transferred 17,280 authorized asylum‐seekers to continue their asylum applications on the mainland and the island of Crete. In 2017, the UNHCR's Urban Accommodation Scheme provided 21,435 places in apartments and buildings to refugees and asylum‐seekers (Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan 2017).
         </p>
         
         <p>In mid‐September a Greek oil tanker carrying 2,500 tons of fuel oil and marine gas sank off the coast of Athens, causing an oil spill. The government was slow to send a clean‐up crew or to ask for help from the European Union, and the toxic oil spread.</p>
         
         <p>In mid‐November, 23 people died in Western Attica in one of the deadliest flash floods in Greece. Tsipras declared 16 November a national day of mourning. The responses to these natural disasters by the SYRIZA‐led national government but also the Regional Governor of Attica,Rena Dourou (also a SYRIZA member), were heavily criticized and raised concerns about the governing ability of SYRIZA.</p>
         
         <p>Foreign visits preoccupied the Greek public. In September, President Emmanuel Macron of France visited Greece and outlined his vision for a stronger and more united Europe. Macron praised Greece's reform efforts and reiterated his call for debt relief. In a joint statement with Greek Prime Minister Tsipras, Macron urged European firms to start investing in Greece to help reduce the country's growing dependence on non‐European countries. In October, Tsipras travelled to the United States and met with US President Donald Trump to strengthen the economic and defence cooperation between Greece and the United States (Liptak <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0013R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). His visit came amid increasing strains in relations between the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member Turkey. The issues on the agenda included the extension of the agreement for the use of the US naval base in Souda Bay, Crete; the possibility of potentially building a new US naval base elsewhere on the island; and the US$2.4 billion upgrading of the Greek military fleet of F‐16 jets (Mally <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0015R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
         </p>
         
         <p>In December, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited Greece. This was the first time a Turkish president visited Greece since Celâl Bayar in 1952. This historic visit took place amid deteriorating relations between Turkey and the West. Erdoğan questioned the Lausanne Treaty and raised concerns about the Muslim minority in Greece (Gall &amp; Kitsantonis <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>). He emphasized that Muslims living in Greek Western Thrace should be able to elect their own religious leaders, muftis, rather than the Greek state appoint them. He likewise repeated his demands for the extradition of eight members of the Turkish armed forces who fled to Greece in a military helicopter after the failed coup in the summer of 2016. The Supreme Court of Greece had refused to extradite the Turkish officers earlier in the year. This visit did little to advance relations between the two Mediterranean neighbours.
         </p>
         
         <p>Following Erdoğan's visit, the 2nd Quadrilateral Summit between Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia was held on 9 December in Belgrade. Serbia's President Aleksandar Vučić welcomed Prime Minister Tsipras, Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boiko Borissov and Romanian Prime Minister Mihai Tudose. During the meeting, Tsipras and his counterparts pledged support for Serbia's membership bid to join the European Union. He also stressed that only through cooperation, solidarity and respect of international law and international treaties, including the Lausanne Treaty, could the Balkan states live peacefully. Joint energy projects, rail and other transport networks were some of the areas over which the four leaders intended to intensify cooperation (Marcus <span><a href="#epdy12201-bib-0016" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12201-bib-0016R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2017</a></span>).
