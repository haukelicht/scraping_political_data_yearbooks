         <p>There was a single change in the Simitis Government during 2002. On 10 June, A. Papadopoulos resigned as Minister of Health and Welfare. He was apparently worn out by his protracted and lone struggle to instil greater efficiency and responsiveness in the so‐called ‘National Health System’ and its dysfunctional public hospitals in the face of stubborn resistance on the part of doctors and other personnel. Papadopoulos was replaced by an affable professor of psychiatry, K. Stefanis (born in 1928). His appointment indicated that no major reforms (and attendant conflicts) are to be expected in this sector until the next parliamentary election.</p>

         <p>In the first months of 2002, the major issue in Greek politics was the European Rapid Reaction Force and its relation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), since this involved Turkish preconditions detrimental to Greek interests. Until it was eventually settled to the satisfaction of Greece, this issue offered a traditional opportunity for the political parties to outbid each other in intransigence on behalf of the national interest.<a href="#t1" class="scrollableLink"></a></p>

         <p>On 11 June, the outgoing mayor of Athens, D. Avramopoulos, finally resolved to dismantle his short‐lived party (KEP), which had been presented as a challenge to the existing party system (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 964). Also in June, the intractable problem of pension reform was laid to rest for a while, thanks to a compromise bill that pacified the unions, while postponing the radical measures that the situation requires.
         </p>
         
         <p>In July, the accidental explosion of a bomb in the hands of a terrorist led to the swift arrest of those involved in the ‘17 November’ organization, the most ruthless and lethal terrorist group in Greece, responsible for dozens of murders and attempted murders since 1975. Awaited in vain for almost three decades, the capture of these terrorists was hailed as a major achievement on the part of the Simitis Government, and greatly enhanced its image on the eve of the local elections (see below).</p>
         
         <p>Following the interlude of these elections, Greek‐Turkish relations again became the major concern in November, involving this time three interrelated issues: (a) the comprehensive settlement proposed by United Nations Secretary‐General Kofi Annan for the reunification of Cyprus (partitioned since the Turkish invasion of 1974); (b) the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union (EU), as part of the new round of EU enlargement; and (c) the prospects of Turkey as a candidate for EU membership. The EU December summit in Copenhagen was to confirm the accession of the Republic of Cyprus, even though no agreement was reached on the proposed settlement by the parties concerned, despite the high hopes created by the change of government in Turkey. The summit also promised Turkey full membership negotiations, to begin in December 2004 if certain conditions are met.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the year ended with Members of Parliament (MPs) having second thoughts about a new constitutional clause they had approved in 2001 (see <i>Political Data Yearbook 2001</i>: 967) that barred them from the exercise of any profession after 1 January.

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Local elections</h2>
         
         <p>As in the past, the local elections held in October 2002 were regarded primarily as a test of strength between Government and Opposition, and as a preview of the parliamentary election due in 2004. In this respect, a major blunder by ND allowed PASOK to mask its losses by focusing attention on a single contest. This was the election of the ‘super‐prefect’ for the Greater Athens area, representing one‐third of the total electorate (although, ironically, the office itself is devoid of actual powers). Seeking to broaden the appeal of its ticket, ND chose as its candidate a maverick centrist journalist, who was bound to antagonize a large segment of the party's own supporters, mostly because of his virulent criticism of the Church over the issue of identity cards (see previous <i>Yearbooks</i>). In protest, at least one‐quarter of ND supporters voted in the first round for an MP previously expelled from the party, who held extreme nationalist and religious views. Consequently, he received as much as 13.6 per cent against a mere 26.7 per cent for the official ND ticket. This provided PASOK with a golden opportunity to launch an alarmist campaign evoking the spectre of the ‘Far Right’. In the runoff, ND was unable to rally all its supporters, and PASOK won by a comfortable margin (56.3 to 43.7 per cent). What was perhaps most alarming, however, was the open intervention of the Church and Archbishop Christodoulos, who appeared to extend his approval to particular candidates. This was the <i>first</i> such intervention in living memory, but provoked no corresponding reaction: PASOK was the beneficiary, while ND was intent on limiting the damage rather than risking an escalation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Its dismal defeat in Greater Athens overshadowed ND successes elsewhere, including, once again, the three major municipalities (Athens, Thessaloniki and Piraeus). In Athens, the new mayor was Dora Bakoyanni, the best‐placed future contender for the ND party leadership, who won with an impressive 60.5 per cent – an all‐time record. ND also increased its overall control of prefectures (‘<i>nomes</i>’), winning a total of 30 as opposed to the 22 won by PASOK (alone or in alliance with SYN), while the remaining two were won by independents. One can hardly speak of a general trend or ‘swing’, since local and personal factors prevailed in many cases. Prefectures and municipalities changed hands accordingly, and party gains and losses mostly cancelled each other out. There were several ‘rebel’ candidates running (and sometimes winning) against the official ticket of their own party. Moreover, almost 50 per cent of the incumbent mayors were defeated. Nonetheless, to the extent that a party vote can be estimated, ND had an overall 6 per cent lead over PASOK. This coincided exactly with the voting intentions found by subsequent opinion polls in November.
         </p>
         
         <p>Finally, among the so‐called ‘traditional left’, SYN once again reaped handsome fruits from its strategy of opportunistic local alliances. In contrast, the orthodox KKE paid the price of isolation. Its municipal influence was considerably reduced, despite the unprofitable alliance with DIKKI and others of no consequence.</p>
