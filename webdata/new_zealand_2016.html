         <p>By international comparison, New Zealand experienced a very stable 2016 in politics, albeit with one particular bombshell – the unexpected resignation of the prime minister towards the end of the year. It was mostly business as usual, with the rejection of a proposed change to the national flag via a binding referendum, and few other changes or significant debates in politics.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> Referendum</h3>
            
            <p>In March, a binding postal referendum was held on whether to change the New Zealand flag. This was the second part of a two‐stage referendum – the previous year a first referendum was held to determine which new flag design would go up against the existing flag in the second vote. The winning flag from this 2015 contest contained a silver fern on a blue and black background (Edwards <span><a href="#epdy12186-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12186-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>).
            </p>
            
            <p>In a straight referendum choice between the old and new designs, the existing flag won decisively, with 56.6 per cent voting for it, and 43.2 per cent voting for the alternative. Explanations for the defeat of the referendum were numerous. Some blamed the procedure behind the flag change process, suggesting that the new flag options were of an inferior quality. Others suggested that the top‐down nature of the project – it was an initiative of Prime Minister John Key – alienated some of the public. In this sense, the rejection of the alternative flag might be read as a New Zealand example of the apparent global trend of publics revoting against being told what to do by political leaders.</p>

            <h3 class="article-section__sub-title section2"> By‐election: Mt Roskill</h3>
            
            <p>A by‐election was held for the Auckland electorate of Mt Roskill on 3 December 2016. This followed the resignation of Phil Goff, who was elected Mayor of Auckland in local government elections in October. The seat was retained by the Labour Party, with new candidate Michael Wood winning easily with 11,623 votes – or 67 per cent of the vote.</p>

         <p>The single biggest political event in New Zealand politics in 2016 was the surprise announcement from Prime Minister John Key that he was retiring from politics. It was a shock – for although there is always speculation about how long prime ministers will stay in the job, there was no prior sign that Key was about to step down.</p>
         
         <p>The prime minister held a press conference on 5 December, announcing that he would be stepping down as he wished to spend more time with his family, stating that he has ‘never seen [himself] as a career politician’ and that ‘this feels [like] the right time to go.’ In addition, he explained, ‘All I can say is that I gave it everything I had. I left nothing in the tank.’</p>
         
         <p>Key had been the leader of the National Party since 2006, and prime minister since 2008. He led his party to three election victories, and both he and his party were still incredibly popular at the time of his resignation. By departing office on his own terms, and before any significant drop in popularity, Key was able to go out on a high, and hence he will possibly be remembered as the most popular prime minister of the modern era.</p>
         
         <p>The subsequent handover of power went smoothly. In announcing his retirement, Key instructed his caucus to prepare to elect a new leader in just one week's time, expressing confidence in his deputy and finance minister Bill English, to take his position.</p>
         
         <p>English was the only candidate for the position (despite others initially intending to stand). The deputy position went to Paula Bennett, a polarising figure with a colourful demeanour and background. She is the second ever female deputy prime minister in New Zealand and the first Maori woman in that position.</p>
         
         <p>A new cabinet was subsequently announced by English on 18 December. See Table <a class="tableLink scrollableLink" title="Link to table" href="#epdy12186-tbl-0002">2</a> for the details.

         <p>The national government had a relatively steady year with fewer significant scandals or embarrassments than usual. The government's most damaging issue for many critics – yet perhaps not the wider public – was the continued controversy over the so‐called ‘Saudi sheep’ scandal, in which the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade had convinced cabinet to spend millions of dollars compensating a Saudi investor due to a change in government policy (Edwards <span><a href="#epdy12186-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy12186-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2016</a></span>). In November, the Auditor‐General released the report of her investigation into the saga, which was seen to clear the government of any illegality, but raised serious concerns about the processes that had been used in this case.
         </p>
         
         <p>National's biggest challenge was the problem of unaffordable housing accommodation – an issue increasingly referred to as the ‘housing crisis’. The price of buying or renting houses has been escalating for many years, and the government was attempting to find solutions to increase the supply of new housing, and reduce demand, particularly in areas of acute unaffordability such as the city of Auckland. Overall, it appeared that the situation was only worsening, and the Minister of Housing Nick Smith, was deemed by many commentators to be ineffective. Meanwhile, with a growing awareness of the problem of homelessness, the Minister of Social Housing Paula Bennett was under severe pressure when the media began highlighting such cases.</p>
         
         <p>In other areas of social policy the government made more progress, introducing a bold set of new measures to reduce family violence, and to change the ways that the state looks after vulnerable children.</p>
         
         <p>Progress was also planned in terms of the environment, with the proposed establishment of a huge ocean sanctuary near New Zealand. But this was impeded when the government failed to consult and deal with Maori interests related to the Kermadec marine area.</p>
         
         <p>New Zealand resumed full naval relations with the United States (US), reflected in the first visit of a navy ship – the <i>USS Sampson</i> – from that country since the 1980s. A previous standoff over New Zealand's nuclear‐free status had stopped the US from sending boats there.

         <p>Parliament was relatively stable throughout the year – although two MPs departed. Labour MP Phil Goff successfully stood for the mayoralty of Auckland city, then resigned his electorate seat, causing a by‐election (see above). And Green Party list MP Kevin Hague resigned in September, and was replaced by the next person on the party list, Barry Coates.</p>
         
         <p>A number of other MPs announced that they would be retiring from politics, but the scheduled departures would be in the following year. On top of the the aforementioned resignation of Prime Minister John Key, some of the higher profile announcements were from the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Murray McCully, the Minister of Education Hekia Parata, the Minister of Pacific Peoples Sam Lotu‐Liga, and the former leader of the Labour Party David Cunliffe.</p>

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy12186-sec-0070-title"> Political party report</h2>
         
         <p>Political parties were remarkably stable during 2016, with the major exception of the National Party changing its leadership due to the resignation of Prime Minister John Key. His deputy, Bill English, replaced him, and Paula Bennett became the new deputy.</p>
         
         <p>A new political party was launched in November by maverick economist Gareth Morgan. Called The Opportunities Party (TOP), the new party was positioned as a centrist party that would be able to work with both major parties of left and right. Although it received plenty of publicity, it was not clear that it would find electoral success at the upcoming 2017 general election.</p>

         <p>It may have been the year of populist politics and revolt around the world, but this 2016 trend was barely spotted in New Zealand. There was little in the way of fervent political debate and disharmony. Yet there were still issues of discontent for the public. The biggest was about housing affordability. Increasingly the phrase ‘housing crisis’ was used as the problem appeared to peak. House prices continued to increase significantly, especially in the biggest city, Auckland.</p>
         
         <p>The government undertook various measures purported to increase the supply of new houses. Restrictions on borrowing for the purchase of houses were also introduced in order to dampen demand, but the effectiveness of these policies was not clear. Stories abounded in the media about homelessness, including families forced to live in cars.</p>
         
         <p>Issues of poverty and economic inequality also underpinned political debate during the year. Yet the economy showed signs of continued improvement, with unemployment down to 4.9 per cent by the end of the year, strong gross domestic product and job growth, but much of this was based on increasing tourism and immigration.</p>
         
         <p>The international Panama Papers story, based on the leaked material from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, created a storm of controversy in New Zealand. Although no illegality was uncovered in the local element of the story, there was pressure on the government to reform the foreign trust industry to ensure that New Zealand could not be regarded as a tax haven.</p>
         
         <p>Progress continued to be made on the Christchurch city rebuild, following on from the tragic earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. Some questioned whether the rebuild was happening fast enough. And then in November a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck further north in Kaikoura, which caused extensive damage including in the capital, Wellington.</p>
