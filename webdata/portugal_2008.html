         <p>The year 2009 was a super election year. Three contests took place within very short period in the second half of the year: politicians fought for places in the European Parliament (EP), in the national legislature and in local councils. The Freeport corruption scandal involving Prime Minister José Socrates also dominated the news.</p>
         
         <p>In the first half of the year the ongoing financial and economic crisis hit Portugal particularly hard. Unemployment rose to 8.9 per cent in the first quarter of the year to 10.1 per cent in the last quarter (CNE 2010), and the budget deficit went from 2.6 per cent in 2007 to 9.3 per cent in 2009 (<i>Jornal de Noticias</i>, 1 February 2010). Two supplementary budgets had to be approved at the end of the year via the votes of the Socialists, the abstention of most parties and the opposition of the Bloc of the Left (BE). The main opposition parties criticised the way the incumbent Socialist government managed the economic crisis. Another major issue was the government's new evaluation model for public school teachers, which was opposed by the other parliamentary parties, particularly the Social Democratic Party (PSD).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss3"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss3-title"> Prime Minister Socrates and the Freeport corruption allegations</h2>
         
         <p>In 2007, the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) started investigations into the allegedly corrupt dealings of the firm Freeport relating to the creation of a shopping centre in the Portuguese city of Alcochete in 2001. In early 2009, the SFO asked for information related to the corruption dealings from the Portuguese authorities, which allegedly involved high‐ranking officials and, indirectly, the Prime Minister, who was then Environment Minister in the second government headed by Antonio Guterres. According to reports from the respected weekly newspaper <i>Expresso</i>, about €4 million were allegedly paid in bribes, which ended up in offshore accounts in tax havens. Due to the lack of evidence, the SFO decided to stop its investigations in November 2009. However, the Portuguese prosecution office decided to open its own investigation into the relationship between Prime Minister Socrates and his cousin Hugo Monteiro. Although there was no official charge against the Prime Minister, the media reported extensively on the case. Hugo Monteiro had used Socrates' name in the dealings, but without his knowledge. Allegedly, Socrates changed the status of a environmentally protected area into a building zone.
         </p>
         
         <p>In May 2009, there were reports of alleged pressure exerted by the Portuguese president of the European‐wide Eurojust, José Luis Lopes da Mota, on the investigators to stop the process. The main function of Eurojust is coordination between prosecuting offices of different countries, so this alleged action was regarded as inappropriate interference. The opposition parties, particularly the CDS‐PP, wanted Lopes da Mota to appear before Parliament. However, this was rejected by the Socialist Party, which had the absolute majority in the legislature. The beleaguered president of Eurojust resigned on 17 December 2009. At end of the year, the deputy chief prosecutor was still waiting for documents that were requested from the British authorities. One of the reasons for the lack of evidence was a fire at the headquarters of Freeport that destroyed 75 per cent of the archives. Moreover, the email archives cannot be handled over to Portuguese authorities because they fall under professional secrecy legislation. It means that it is very unlikely that a continuation of the Portuguese investigations will be possible due to lack of evidence.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss4"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss4-title"> The European Parliament elections on 7 June 2009</h2>
         
         <p>The European Parliament (EP) elections were perceived by all parliamentary parties as a dress rehearsal for the forthcoming general election in the autumn, although the date had not yet been fixed. In this sense, the main target of the campaign was not the European Union (EU) and European issues, but the policies of the government. The two main parties, the socialists (PS) and the centre‐right social democrats (PSD), are pro‐European, so the main campaign, particularly for PSD, was about strategic opposition. It was expected that the PS would lose heavily in the EP elections but, still manage to win. This was due to the lacklustre performance of its main rival under the leadership of Manuela Ferreira Leite, a former Finance Minister without charismatic appeal. However, the inexperienced head of list, the lawyer Paulo Rangel, was quite successful in getting his message across and he focused on mismanagement of structural funds and weak representation of the national interest by the government. He was able to gain a fundamental advantage in relation to the main candidate of the PS, Vital Moreira, who was perceived as too distanced from the population and spoke very legalistic language due to his background as a judge and law professor. Both parties were supportive of the Treaty of Lisbon and the re‐election of their compatriot, Manuel Durão Barroso (former leader of PSD), to the post of President of the European Commission.</p>
         
         <p>The conservative CDS‐PP had a similar pro‐European campaign to the main political parties, although it emphasised the need to protect national sovereignty and its strategic opposition to the economic policies of the government. Nuno Melo was the relatively young head of the party's list. The radical left‐wing Communists (PCP‐PEV) and the Bloc of the Left (BE), whose lists were headed by Ilda Figueiredo and Miguel Portas, respectively, emphasised aspects related to the crisis of capitalism due to the financial downturn, which had considerable resonance among the population.</p>
         
         <p>In the opinion polls, in spite of predicted heavy losses, the PS would have clinched victory. However, a major event may have tipped the balance in favour of the PSD. Socrates kickstarted its campaign with fellow Spanish Socialist Prime Minister José Luis Zapatero in Valencia and in Coimbra on 23 April 2009. Socrates spoke in Spanish to the public in Valencia. This was criticised by the social democrats, who launched a populist anti‐Spanish campaign to rally its supporters against the socialists. This event was also used by the radical left‐wing BE.</p>
         
         <p>The results of the European elections led to a bitter defeat for the socialists, who lost 18 per cent of its share of the vote in 2004. They ended up in second place with 28.4 per cent and below a million votes. However, the social democrats did not improve on their 2004 result, when they formed an electoral coalition with the CDS‐PP. They got 34 per cent. The big winner of the EP elections was BE, which became the third largest party in the Portuguese national delegation. This was particularly humiliating for the orthodox Communist Party, which only came fourth. The CDS‐PP put in the weakest performance of the parliamentary parties (<span title=""><a href="#b6" class="bibLink tab-link" id="b6R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" aria-label="Reference 6">6</a>, <a href="#b7" class="bibLink tab-link" id="b7R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" aria-label="Reference 7">7</a></span>).

      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss5"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss5-title"> The elections to the Assembly of the Republic on 27 September 2009</h2>
         
         <p>During the summer, preparations were undertaken for the forthcoming legislative elections scheduled for 27 September 2009. The pre‐campaign started in August with different political parties organising campaigning events. Throughout September, there were several television debates between the leaders of the main parliamentary parties. All opposition parties emphasised the dire management of the financial and economic crisis by the socialist government under Prime Minister Socrates. At the beginning of September, opinion polls gave a slight advantage of just one percentage point to the Socialist Party, while the PSD remained a close second. However, neither of these two main parties were predicted to achieve an absolute majority – something the socialist government achieved in previous legislative elections in 2005. Both parties were predicted to achieve about 33 and 32 per cent, respectively. While the larger parties had difficulty mobilising their voters, the smaller parties, BE, PCP and CDS‐PP, were predicted to improve on their scores from 2005. The Bloquistas looked like achieving about 9.6 per cent and surpass again the Communists with 9.4 per cent.The conservative CDS‐PP were on course for 8 per cent.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout the electoral campaign, Prime Minister Socrates was able to gain ground and increase the lead in relation to the PSD. One of the main reasons was that PSD leader Manuela Ferreira Leite was not charismatic enough to mobilise the party's constituency. Her campaign focused on criticising the government for the bad management of the financial and economic crisis. However, Socrates could play his charismatic advantage and government incumbency against her. Moreover, Maria Ferreira Leite had to deal with growing dissatisfaction with her leadership style within her own party. New potential candidates for the leadership were preparing themselves to replace her after the legislative elections should she lose them.</p>
         
         <p>Probably a huge strategic mistake was to use once again the anti‐Spanish card in the television debate with Prime Minister Socrates in middle of September. She declared herself against the proposed high‐speed train between Lisbon and Madrid to be funded with EU structural funds. She regarded this as an attempt on the part of the Spaniards to transform Portugal into a ‘Spanish province’. She also alleged that Prime Minister Socrates was only doing a favour to the Spaniards, who were very keen to proceed with the project. Socrates robustly rebuked her attempt to whip up anti‐Spanish sentiment, and defended the high‐speed rail link as a positive project for the Portuguese economy. Meanwhile, both Communists and Bloquistas demanded full nationalisation of the banking sector, withdrawal of the liberalisation measures related to the labour market and more engagement in the fight against unemployment. CDS‐PP emphasised particularly the need to reinforce support for small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises.</p>
         
         <p>Shortly before the legislative elections, the PS widened its lead so that it was now some eight percentage points ahead of the PSD according to the respective opinion polls. The election results confirmed the last opinion polls and the PS won a relative majority of 36.56 per cent and 96 seats. The socialists lost 8.7 per cent and 23 seats. The big loser was the PSD, which in spite of a catastrophic economic situation was not able to win. The improvement from the last legislative elections of 2005 was just 0.4 per cent and six more seats. The big winner of the elections was the radical left‐wing BE, which was able to improve by 50 per cent its share of the vote and double its seats from 8 to 16. Another loser in the elections was the communist coalition, CDU, which was able to improve by 0.6 per cent and get one seat more than in 2005, but was surpassed by the BE and the conservative CDS‐PP (which also improved considerably and made it over 10 per cent) – and lost its place as the third strongest party in the country</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss6"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss6-title"> Local elections on 11 October 2009</h2>
         
         <p>Soon after the legislative elections ended, political parties had to start the campaign for the local elections. The position of PSD leader Manuela Ferreira Leite became increasingly untenable at the end of the year. A loss in the local elections would trigger the final process towards party leadership replacement. In the local elections, the PS won a massive victory and the PSD lost a considerable amount of councils and councillors. PS won 131 councils (+21 in relation to 2005), PSD 139 (−18 ), the communist coalition CDU 28 (−4), the conservative CDS 1 (no change) and BE 1 (no change). The local elections showed that the small parties, CDS and BE, are almost insignificant at the local level, and that the CDU continues to lose councils and councillors from election to election.</p>
         
      </section><section class="article-section__content" id="ss7"><h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="ss7-title"> New government: Socrates II</h2>
         
         <p>The new government of Prime Minister Socrates carried over nine ministers from the previous legislative period and appointed eight new ones. Nine independents and five women are part of the government. Among the new ministers are the pianist and piano teacher Gabriela Canavilha, who took over the Ministry of Culture, and António Mendonça, associate professor at the Higher Institute of Economy and Management (ISEG) in Lisbon, who became the new Public Works Minister. The highly sensitive Ministry of Education was taken over by Isabel Alçada, who is close to the Socialist Party and has been engaged in administrative positions for the enhancement of reading skills among school pupils. Maria Helena Santos André has taken over the Ministry for Employment and Social Affairs. She was a high‐ranking officer attached to the Secretary‐General of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). Dulce Passaro, the new Minister of Environment and Territorial Organisation, is a well‐known and competent civil servant specialising in research related to environmental issues. Antonio Serrano is full professor at the University of Évora and has taken over the Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry. Inside the party, the well‐known politician Jorge Lacão became the new liaison minister with the Assembly of the Republic. Alberto Martins was Minister of Justice in the Guterres Government in 1999 and has been a socialist MP until his renewed appointment as Minister of Justice in the Socrates II Government. He is considered to belong to the left‐wing of the Socialist Party.</p>
