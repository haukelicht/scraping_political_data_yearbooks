         <p>The calling of a general election on 14 March capped the most adversarial legislative period since the beginning of the transition process and set the scene for a highly competitive campaign, which saw one of the highest turnouts in Spain's recent electoral history. Again, as nearly always, the Basque terrorist group (ETA) killed a former Socialist councillor two days before polling day. It was the second time that the leaders of the main parties, PSOE's Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and the PP's Mariano Rajoy, competed with each other for the premiership. It was also the second time in Spanish electoral history (the first was in 1993) that the two candidates went up against each other in televised debates.</p>
         
         <p>The Socialist victory was won by a tight margin, just as the pre‐election polls had predicted. The gap between PSOE and PP was reduced (from 4.9 per cent in 2004 to 3.5 per cent in 2008) and PP increased both its share of the votes (405,829 new votes) and its haul of seats (six gains, in contrast to the five of PSOE). PSOE managed to increase its vote in 13 of the 17 Autonomous Communities with the most significant increases in Catalonia and the Basque Country. These two regions gave the PSOE 23 deputies more than the PP, although it should be noted that there was a drop in participation both in Catalonia (4.8 per cent fewer people voted) and the Basque Country (where the drop was 10.1 per cent). The decline in the Socialist vote in Andalusia, Castile La Mancha and the Autonomous Communities of Madrid, Valencia and Murcia was mirrored by an increase in PP's vote. There were three important characteristics of PP's advance: first, in all the regions where PP increased its support (with the exception of Andalusia) participation increased to almost 80 per cent, indicating a reverse of the normal tendency whereby a high turnout always benefits the left; second, the losses suffered by PSOE and the gains made by PP repeated the tendency shown in the local elections of 2007; and third, a comparison between the overall turnout and the votes gained by PP indicate that it had been successful in attracting support from former PSOE voters.</p>
         
         <p>The competitive political cycle that began 15 years ago only increased in intensity. Turnout, at 73.8 per cent, was one of the highest seen in Spain. Meanwhile, voters gave the greatest support to the two main parties, and as a consequence the growth of the bipartisanship was reinforced: the two main parties, PSOE and PP, both increased their share of the vote and their seats in Parliament – together the two parties gained 84 per cent of the votes (80 per cent in 2004) and 92 per cent of the parliamentary seats (89 per cent in 2004). As a consequence, the share of other parties – mainly nationalists and regionalists – was reduced by 812,023 votes. This was due to the collapse of Izquierda Unida, the fall in the level of support for the Basque Nationalist Party and the Left Republican Party of Catalonia, the ERC. In contrast, the continuing support for others, such as the Catalonian nationalist party, CiU, which held fast in the face of a strong campaign by the Catalan Socialist Party, and the Nationalist Party of Galicia (BNG). A new national centre‐left political party, UpyD, led by a former Socialist R. Diez, entered the Lower House.</p>

         <p>The year finished without any pronouncements from the Constitutional Court on several motions objecting to the new Catalonian Statute of Autonomy. Nevertheless, the issue of the territorial reform of the state and the peace process loomed large, both on the Government's agenda and in the battle between Government and Opposition. However, as the year wore on, debate became increasingly dominated by the economy. On the supply side, the sudden halt in spending had a big impact, especially on industry and construction. As a result, employment fell by 0.5 per cent in 2008 (compared with an increase of 3.1 per cent in 2007) and the unemployment rate climbed substantially to 11.3 per cent for the year as a whole. Turning to inflation, the growth rate stood at 4.1 per cent for the year, above the related figure for the previous year (2.8 per cent), although in the second half of the year it slowed rapidly to reach an annual rate of change of 1.4 per cent in December – the lowest figure since 1998. This gave rise to a negative price differential vis‐à‐vis the euro area. The Spanish government increased the deposit guarantee limit and approved the granting of state guarantees for new lending by credit institutions in Spain. In late November it set up a state fund for local investment (endowed with €8 billion), dedicated to funding employment‐generating investment at the municipal level. It also created a special state fund to reinvigorate the economy and employment (endowed with €3 billion) to allow strategic sectors to pursue projects that also have an impact on employment.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the government adopted a series of measures that reduced the tax burden on households and firms. As a result of these factors, and of the forgone revenue entailed by the disappearance of the extraordinary revenues linked to the real estate boom, public finances deteriorated rapidly in 2008: from a surplus of 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2007, they are running a deficit that might rise to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2008, according to the latest Stability Programme update. For 2009, the Government envisages a further increase in the deficit, which might stand close to 6 per cent of GDP, although a portion of this deterioration can be explained by the launching of the above‐mentioned funds for municipal investment and for reinvigorating the economy.</p>
         
         <p>The Spanish economy has over the past year undergone a very severe adjustment, exacerbated by the prolonged instability on international financial markets, which is giving rise to a severe weakening of world economic activity, a marked loss of confidence and a tightening of private‐sector financing conditions. A large part of the deterioration in activity is rapidly affecting employment, and this is one of the main channels through which the adjustment is being spread to the rest of the economy, magnifying its effects on spending plans. The effect of interest rate reductions, cheaper oil, the decline in inflation, the effect of the expansionary measures taken and a possible end to the financial turmoil may help to alleviate the contractionary tendencies. However, given the recessionary climate in the world economy, it is hard to believe recovery will be rapid.</p>
         
         <p>Anti‐corruption policies also figured during this period, particularly those related to urban development irregularities at the local government level. As a result, there was a great amount of anti‐corruption legislation, although the overall balance of its application still leaves much to be desired.</p>
