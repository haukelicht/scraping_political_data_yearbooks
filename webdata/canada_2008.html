         <p>After the political turbulence of 2008, the year 2009 turned out to be one of the quietest in recent memory. When Parliament returned in January, the big question was whether the opposition had the will or capacity to bring down the government as they had proposed the previous November. That effort had prompted the government to defend itself by simply proroguing Parliament (see <span title=""><a href="#b1" id="#b1R" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">Carty 2009</a></span>). It soon became clear that the Liberals, under their new leader, Michael Ignatieff, had no appetite for coalition politics. In the spring they declared that they would put the government on probation and seek quarterly performance reports, but then in the autumn announced they would no longer support it. This forced the other opposition parties to abandon their automatic rejection of all government business, but, as none of the parties wanted an election, Parliament drifted through the year with no clear sense of direction.
         </p>
         
         <p>The principal issue on the public agenda was how to react to the financial crisis that had undermined the global economy. All agreed that governments (both national and provincial) needed to take aggressive action to maintain consumer demand and ameliorate the social costs of rising unemployment levels. The opposition parties wanted more public spending than the Harper Conservative government seemed willing to provide but, given the political stalemate, and a recognition that Canada was in a stronger position than most other Western systems, were prepared to live with the stimulus package proposed.</p>
         
         <p>During the spring, fears of an H1N1 pandemic produced a good deal of confusion about vaccine distribution and long lines at some public clinics. By the end of the year, some 40 per cent of the population had been vaccinated (probably not enough to stymie an epidemic) but no widespread public health crisis emerged.</p>
         
         <p>The other issue to animate the public agenda was climate change. The government sought to ignore the issue as much as possible claiming that it was not possible to develop an effective (and therefore realistic) policy until it was clear what the Americans were going to do. This may have been true, but it also reflected the government's recognition that any policy would divide the country (and especially its provincial governments that control natural resources) on regional grounds. It also reflected their conservative reluctance to take the issue as seriously as most activists believed was necessary. Thus Canada went to the international Copenhagen climate conference in December with no plan for significant action on the issue.</p>
         
         <p>In April and May, the public was held spellbound by a public inquiry charged with considering the financial relationship between one Karlheinz Schreiber, a lobbyist for several German organisations who was desperately fighting extradition to Germany, where he was wanted on charges of tax evasion, bribery and fraud, and former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. While the judge conducting the inquiry has yet to release his report, the spectacle of the former Prime Minister trying to explain his actions made for compelling television and many agreed that he did little to enhance his reputation.</p>
         
         <p>Later in the year it was the turn of a House of Commons committee to command attention when it held hearings to determine whether the Canadian military had violated the Geneva Convention in Afghanistan by handing over captured insurgents to the Afghans. The claim was that those detainees were then being tortured. Opposition politicians argued that the government knew that this was happening and did nothing about it. The prorogation of Parliament at the end of the year abruptly ended the committee's work and it is not clear whether it would be taken up when the House reassembled in 2010.</p>
         
         <p>With its Senate reform measures stalled, the government moved aggressively to take control of the Senate and, over the course of the year, the Prime Minister made 27 appointments to the upper house – 15 on 2 January, two on 8 January, one on 14 January and nine more on 27 August. All new Senators, though appointed to age 75, have promised to support plans for Senate reform, including the controversial proposal for eight‐year term limits. By the end of the year, the Conservatives were close to controlling the Senate (see <a href="#t2" class="scrollableLink">Table 2</a>) and expect to be able to outnumber the Liberals during 2010. At that point it is expected that the government will make a major push to implement its plans for an elected upper house.

         <p>Elections were held in just two of the country's provinces during the year. On the west coast, the British Columbia Liberals (no relation to the national Liberals) won their third election in a row, promising to manage the economy through the recession as they anticipated the benefits of hosting the winter Olympics scheduled for Vancouver in February 2010. The campaign was coupled with another referendum on electoral reform as the Citizens' Assembly proposal to switch to single transferable vote (STV) had captured 58 per cent of the vote in 2005 – just two points below the mandated threshold. This time, however, there was apparently much less appetite for change and the proposal garnered only 39 per cent support. This defeat marks the end of a decade of active electoral reform efforts in various provinces and would appear to have killed it as an active issue on the political agenda.</p>
         
         <p>Voters on the east coast seemed less resistant to change, and Nova Scotia elected a New Democratic Party (NDP) government. This was the first time the social‐democratic NDP had ever won an election in any of the Atlantic provinces, and it would be carefully watched to see what difference, if any, it might make.</p>
