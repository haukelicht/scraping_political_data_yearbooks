         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy26-sec-0002-title"> Election report: Municipal and provincial elections</h2>
         
         <p>The municipal (kommune) and provincial (fylke) elections were held on 12 September. Labour received 31.7 per cent of the vote, which was an increase of 2 per cent since the last local elections, but quite a lot better than what the polls had indicated earlier that year. The increase was said to be a reaction to the terrorist attacks against the government headquarters and the Labour youth camp on the island of Utøya on July 22 as well as a response to how leading politicians from the Labour Party, including Prime Minister Stoltenberg, had handled the attack. Labour's coalition partner, the Socialist Left, and the Centre Party both experienced a decline to 4.1 and 6.7 per cent of the votes, respectively. The biggest changes, however, were seen on the right side of the political spectrum. The Conservatives experienced the largest increase and got 28 per cent of the votes – almost 9 per cent more than they had received in the previous local elections. The increase was said to be related to the party's new strategy of focusing on welfare issues. The right‐wing Progress Party suffered from an extensive decline of more than 6 per cent, resulting in 11.4 per cent of the vote. This was their worst election result since 1995, and was caused by a set of scandals as well as the debate that occurred after the terror attacks. The Liberals and the Christian Democratic Party only experienced smaller changes and received 6.3 and 5.6 per cent of the votes, respectively.</p>
         
         <p>There were high expectations related to the election turnout in 2011, as the public discussion after the terrorist attacks had stressed a special need to show support for the Norwegian democracy. Although there was a slight increase since the last local elections in 2007, and especially among young voters, many were clearly disappointed with the turnout of 64.2 per cent. The mobilisation of young voters was probably related both to the terrorist attacks and to the 2011 voting‐age experiment (Bergh &amp; Ødegård <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0004R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2012</a></span>). In twenty municipalities the voting age was lowered to 16 years, and the experiment received a lot of public attention.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy26-sec-0003-title"> Changes in the cabinet</h2>
         
         <p>Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg made three changes to the cabinet in 2011. In April, Minister of Petroleum and Energy Terje Riis‐Johansen announced that he wanted to resign. Officially, he declared that the reason for his resignation was to be able to run for the position of county mayor of Telemark in the upcoming local elections. However, there had been speculations about his resignation for a long time, and he had received extensive criticism from environmentalists and the opposition, including a proposal of no‐confidence. The criticism was related to the controversial plan of building a major new power line over and around Norway's scenic and famed Hardanger Fjord as well as to the severe setbacks in Norway's efforts to fully recapture carbon emissions at Norwegian power plants (Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 1085). His decision to resign came after the government had concluded on both of these two problematic issues, and media pundits declared that this was done in order to protect his successor. Riis‐Johansen was replaced by Ola Borten Moe. Borten Moe, who had been a Member of Parliament since 2005, is also known as the grandchild of former Norwegian Prime Minister Per Borten (1965–1971).
         </p>
         
         <p>The second round of changes came in November, when Minister of Justice and the Police Knut Storberget resigned. He had wanted to resign for a long time for family reasons, but due to the terror attacks it was decided that his resignation should be postponed a few more months. Storberget had been under severe political pressure on several occasions since he started as Minister in 2005. After a dispute referred to as ‘the Hijab affair’, for instance (Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0003R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2009</a></span>: 1119), he felt indisposed and was off sick due to a heavy workload. After the terror attacks there was also significant criticism directed towards the police and the minister, but the opposition had sympathy and respect for his decision to resign and declared that this also indicated that he took the necessary responsibility for the mistakes that had been made. Storberget returned to his post as MP and was replaced by Minister of Defence Grete Faremo, who previously had served as Minister of Justice (1992–1996) (see Heidar <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0005R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">1997</a></span>). With this change it was also decided to rename the ministry ‘the Ministry of Justice and Public Security’. Faremo was replaced by Espen Barth Eide, who came from the position of State Secretary for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

         <h2 class="article-section__title section__title section1" id="epdy26-sec-0004-title"> Issues in national politics</h2>
         
         <p>The terror attacks on 22 July had the most dramatic impact on Norway in 2011. The first attack was a car bomb explosion in the executive government quarter, which killed eight people, injured many more and critically damaged Norway's government headquarters. The second attack occurred less than two hours later at a summer camp on the island of Utøya, which was organised by the Workers' Youth League (AUF), the youth division of the ruling Norwegian Labour Party. The terrorist, a 32 year‐old Norwegian right‐wing extremist, dressed in a homemade police uniform and showing false identification, gained access to the island and subsequently opened fire at the participants, killing 69 and injuring more than 110 people. The terrorist, Anders Behring Breivik, was later arrested on the island where he admitted that he carried out both attacks, but pleaded not guilty to the charges and claimed that it was an act of self‐defence. He argued that it had been necessary in order to prevent the Islamisation of Europe, and that the attacks were meant to provoke a conflict between multiculturalists and anti‐Islamists.</p>
         
         <p>In a public address, Prime Minister Stoltenberg declared that this was the worst atrocity in Norway since the Second World War, and that the only proper answer to the violence was ‘more democracy, more openness, but not naivety’. The message was that the attack should not hurt Norwegian democracy. At the same time, national and local politicians all over the country needed time for mourning, funerals and re‐organisation of their campaign plans. As a small country it was estimated that one in four Norwegians knew a victim affected by the attacks. The seven political parties in the Storting thus decided to delay the start of the electoral campaign for the local elections, but not to postpone the actual election date. The campaign began three weeks prior to election day on 12 September, and not early in August as has been the case in previous elections. The parties also agreed to carry out the election campaign in a ‘civilised’ manner and to avoid negative campaigning. Because of this, it was decided to cancel the so‐called ‘school debates’ and replace them with political marketplaces. The school elections would run as usual.</p>
         
         <p>The attacks did influence the election campaign. Among other things, they shifted the focus away from some issues that had been highly problematic for the incumbent parties in the first half of the year, like the closure of local maternity wards and birthing units (for the start of this debate, see Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 1086). The attacks also stressed other issues that appeared more problematic for the Progress Party. The terrorist had, for instance, previously been a member of the party (from 1999–2004). Although no‐one blamed the party for the attacks, the Progress Party was criticised for stirring up a hostile anti‐immigration and anti‐Islam debate (for earlier incidents, see Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0002R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2010</a></span>: 1119). Previous party leader Carl I. Hagen, who now was running for mayor of Oslo, was also heavily criticised for his continuous claim that ‘almost all terrorists are Muslims’. Objections were also strong when he argued that the high amount of resources used on police investigations and a court trial in the aftermath of the attacks was unnecessary. There was some discussion of public security, and criticism of the police – who were accused of being inefficient and unorganised during and prior to the attacks – but the majority, however, agreed to postpone this type of criticism until the final investigations had been completed.
         </p>
         
         <p>Immigration had also been a salient issue in the beginning of the year, but for totally different reasons. On January 12, a young female illegal immigrant from Russia was arrested after her application for asylum had been rejected. Publicly she was well known as ‘Maria Amelie’, a pseudonym she used when writing a controversial book <i>Ulovlig norsk</i> (<i>Illegally Norwegian</i>) in 2010. Later that year she had also been named ‘Norwegian of the Year’ by the Norwegian news magazine <i>Ny Tid</i> because of her contributions to the public debate on the political and social rights of undocumented immigrants in Norway. The interest from the media after her arrest was extensive, and the incumbent parties strongly disagreed on the issue. The Labour Party was clear about the need to deport all illegal immigrants when their application for asylum or residence permit had been rejected. The Socialist Left Party strongly objected to her deportation. They argued that children that became illegal immigrants because of their parent's actions should not be held responsible for this. They also argued that Norway needed more flexible legislation that would let rejected asylum seekers with high job qualifications apply for a work permit instead. The Liberals and the Christian Democratic Party also agreed with the Socialist Left, while the Conservatives and the Progress Party basically supported Labour's policy. They argued, however, that the police should prioritise deporting illegal immigrants who were less integrated, and supported the need for new legislation. On 24 January, Maria Amelie was deported from Norway to Russia, but she returned again on 16 April, after having been granted a work permit. In October a new regulation, also known as ‘lex Amelie’, was introduced. The new regulation allows asylum seekers with a final rejection to re‐apply for a work permit, but only if they first returned to their home country, and then document correct identification papers, higher education and a job offer in Norway.
         </p>
         
         <p>A few other issues also caused controversy within the coalition government. The dispute over the reorganisation of the Norwegian hospital service continued in 2011 (see Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 1086), and when several regional health enterprises decided to close down hospital maternity wards and local birthing units, it was particularly problematic for the Centre Party who were accused by their own supporters of not fighting hard enough against closure.
         </p>
         
         <p>Some supporters were also disappointed that the party was not able to have a greater impact in a new parliamentary settlement on carnivorous animals. The Socialistic Left and the Liberals wanted to increase the number of wolves and bears in Norway, while the Centre Party and the Progress Party had the opposite stand. They were concerned about the safety of inhabitants and domestic animals in carnivore‐exposed areas. In June, all seven parliamentary parties, however, agreed that there should be an upper limit on the number of bears and a reduction in the number of male bears. Although all parties officially expressed that they were happy with the results, critics claimed that the new settlement was not significantly different from the slated previous agreement.</p>
         
         <p>For the Socialist Left Party, the most problematic issues revolved around the environment and Norway's military participation in the operation against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. While the party leadership supported the Norwegian participation in the NATO‐led air assaults on Libya, many party members were strongly against it. Although a majority followed the leadership at their national convention vote, a minority within the party continued to stress that the Norwegian fighter jets should return. The Libya operation was, however, clearly supported by all the other parliamentary parties.</p>
         
         <p>A more significant conflict appeared between the Socialist Left Party and their coalition partner Labour over questions related to the environment and climate change. The coalition parties – Labour, the Socialist Left and the Centre Party – kept arguing over a white paper in progress. All three parties actively supported emission cuts abroad, but disagreed over how to cut emissions at home in Norway and whether or not to include forests when calculating emissions. There was also disagreement over a proposal to establish a ‘climate fund’. The Socialist Left and the Centre Party supported such a fund, and argued that this should be fed by new carbon taxes with the purpose of financing emissions reduction. Top leaders of Labour, including Prime Minister Stoltenberg and Minister of Finance Sigbjørn Johnsen, were strongly against it. The climate report to the Storting was postponed several times and by the end of 2011 it was clear that the report would not be completed until 2012.</p>
         
         <p>On another issue, related to a European Union directive on postal services, the Socialist Party and the Centre Party indirectly gained support for their position. As with the issue of a climate fund, the party leadership in Labour was in disagreement with its coalition partners. They wanted Norway to once again go along with the EU directive, but a grassroots movement within the party, who agreed with their coalition partners, mobilised and forced a ‘no’ vote on the issue at a national Labour Party meeting in April. The EU directive would deregulate Norway's postal system along with others in Europe, and the opponents feared that it would destroy the Norwegian postal service (Posten) if postal services were to be put out to tender. This was the first time Norway indicated to the EU that it planned to use its veto right. Labour managed to receive support for the EU directive on data retention though (see Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 1088–1089). They compromised with the Conservatives on restoring information for six months, and not twelve as Labour initially had wanted. The Conservatives were, however, still divided over this issue, and several of its members voted against the directive in the parliament on April 4.
         </p>
         
         <p>Debates about labour law violations also received much attention in 2011. The debate started when the Norwegian public broadcaster (NRK) revealed that the recruitment firm Adecco was responsible for serious violations under the working Environment Act regarding working time. Adecco was accused of the exploitation of workers, many of them foreigners in Norway. Labour and the Socialist Left Party soon used these cases as examples of why one should avoid temporary employment through private contractors. It was later discovered that municipal enterprises had been responsible for similar violations, and the Conservatives and the Progress Party stressed that labour law violations had nothing to do with private or public ownership.</p>
         
         <p>Public attention was also directed towards a few other scandals in 2011, two of which involved the Progress Party. The first was revealed in March with allegations against Trond Birkedal, the Progress Party's candidate for mayor of Stavanger and former adviser to party leader Siv Jensen, regarding sexual misconduct and the illicit filming of a minor. Jensen and other senior figures were then revealed to have known about the allegations without reporting them. Birkedal was arrested and the debate soon focused on whether he had exploited his position as leader of the party's youth organisation (FpU) and why party leaders had failed to prevent it. The party fell significantly in the polls after the scandal broke.</p>
         
         <p>In late September, the party was hit by another sex scandal when MP Bård Hoksrud broke Norwegian law by paying for sex with a prostitute on a weekend trip to Latvia with three members of the party's youth group. The story was revealed by a television crew, using a hidden camera as Hoksrud left a so‐called ‘massage institute’. Hoksrud quickly admitted that he had broken the law and resigned from all his entrusted posts within the party. The party deputy leader claimed that sex scandals within the Progress Party were revealed more often than in other parties because the media were more hostile towards them.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, a conclusion to the scandals that had troubled the Centre Party in 2010 was reached in February when Økokrim, Norway's special police unit for white‐collar crime, announced a fine over campaign funding violations (see Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 1087). Although the fine was an embarrassing punishment, Navarsete did not resign and claimed that she had the confidence of party members and that the trouble had ‘brought the party together’ in a show of support. It probably also helped that the fine was directed towards the party's former general secretary and an external communication consultant.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is also worth mentioning that the Christian Democrats elected their new leader in April. Dagfinn Høybråten had decided to resign in 2010 (see Aalberg <span><a href="#epdy26-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" id="epdy26-bib-0001R" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2011</a></span>: 1088) and Knut Arild Hareide, a 38 year‐old MP, became the new party leader.
