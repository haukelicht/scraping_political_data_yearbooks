(Napolitano's decision to stand for re‐election reversed a longstanding tradition of one‐term presidencies.)

Renzi's decision provoked a furore from within ranks of the FI and above all from Berlusconi himself, who felt that Renzi had betrayed the cooperation in the constitutional reform process during 2014.

luxembourg_2013,2,Election report,1,1,"In early 2013, politics in Luxembourg was dominated by a succession of ‘affairs’ that began in 2012 (Dumont et al. 2013: 156). These affairs strongly hampered people's trust in the largest party of the country, the CSV, continuously at the helm of government since 1979, and to a lesser extent its junior coalition partner, the LSAP. Leading figures of the CSV were involved in the hearings of the special parliamentary committee of inquiry set up in December 2012 on the illegal activities of the state intelligence services, the Service de Renseignements de l'Etat Luxembourgeois (SREL), and those of the trial regarding the ‘Bommeleeër affair’ (an unsolved case of a series of bombings in the mid‐1980s). Prime Minister Jean‐Claude Juncker was heard three times by the parliamentary committee of inquiry (which met no fewer than 47 times in six months) in order to understand how the state intelligence services under his responsibility had become so dysfunctional and to justify why he had not taken measures or at least informed the regulatory parliamentary committee in charge of checking this service.",Luxembourg 2013,2013
